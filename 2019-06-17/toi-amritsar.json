The last time cotton was sown on more than 4 lakh hectares was in the 2014-15 season. Primarily, the rise in area under the cash crop is seen as a reflection of its price crossing the Rs 6,000-per-quintal mark at the end of the 2018-19 season. Though cotton is, ideally, sown till May 15 in Punjab, delayed harvesting of wheat due to untimely rain pushed sowing back to May 31. It was also being sown till Sunday. Any crop which is sown late is prone to pest attacks. According to Punjab agriculture and farmer welfare department, cotton had been sown on 4,00,056 hectares in Punjab till Monday \u2014 a40% rise from the 2018-19 season, when the crop\u2019s cultivation area was 2.83 lakh hectares. The last time cotton was sown on more than 4 lakh hectares was in the 2014-15 season. At the time, the crop covered 4.21 lakh hectares. In 2015-16, area under it fell to 3.35 lakh hectares. That season, over 60% crop was damaged due to a whitefly attack. For the next three years, the crop was sown on less than 3 lakh hectares of land \u2014 2.85 lakh hectares in 2016-17, 2.91 lakh hectares in 2017-18 and 2.83 lakh hectares in 2018-19. For this season, the agriculture department had initially a target of 3.2 lakh hectares for area under cotton, but later had revised it to 4 lakh hectares. The department was not expected to meet the target at first, said an agriculture department official. More farmers returning to cultivating cotton is seen as a positive trend because paddy consumes more water, which is in scarcity in Malwa. Paddy transplantation is yet to start officially. Last year it was transplanted in nearly 390 lakh hectares. The minimum support price (MSP) for cotton was increased from Rs 4,220 per quintal in the 2017-18 season to Rs 5,350 per quintal in 2018-19. \u201cGoing by the spurt in cotton prices in the end of the season this year, we decided to revert back to the crop,\u201d said Sivian village farmers Gurmukh Singh and Mohinder Singh. Farmer Gurjant Singh of Kot Shamir village said they found cotton to be more lucrative and shifted to the cash crop. Punjab agriculture department director Sutantar Kumar said they felt farmers would benefit \u201cimmensely\u201d by reverting to cotton. \u201cThe department provided every support to farmers for cotton sowing. Though such hot and sultry season is not beneficial for the crop, weather is expected to change in a couple of days and cotton will be safe,\u201d he said.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

The Indian Medical Association (IMA) announced a nationwide strike on Monday to express solidarity with the victim doctors. \u201cWe are already working under constant fear and this recent incident has only aggravated our anxiety. The government has to come up with stringent laws, so that exemplary punishments are given to persons attacking doctors and ransacking hospitals,\u201d said Dr Hartej Singh Nagpal, who runs the 100-bedded Hartej Hospital, while talking to TOI on Sunday. He said the Kolkata incident had forced him to rethink over his hospital\u2019s security. \u201cAt present, we have just around half a dozen unarmed guards, but now I am thinking to hire private security,\u201d he saud, adding that the nursing homes cell of IMA\u2019s Amritsar chapter was holding a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issue in detail. Fortis Hospital director (cardiology) Dr Arun Chopra said they had 35-40 unarmed guards, of which only 12-15 were present in the hospital at any given time. \u201cBut they are insufficient to handle a frenzied mob of even 50 persons,\u201d he said. He agreed with Dr Nagpal on hospital not having any other option. The Times of India on Sunday visited a few private hospitals. It found out that some doctors had hired security guards and deployed them in plain clothes and a few of them were even posing as patients, while there were doctors who brought licensed weapons to the hospital. Doctors were collectively of the view that poor infrastructure in government hospitals often forces patients to rush to private ones and many of them were not able to bear the high cost of treatment. In case of the patient\u2019s death of a patien, the kin didn\u2019t want to pay pending bills and started blaming doctors for negligence . \u201cOften these kind of people are sheltered by some local politicians, who instigate them to stage a dharna against the hospital and mount pressure on the management to waive their remaining bill,\u201d said a doctor, who didn\u2019t wish to give his name. Medicity managing director Dr Avtar Singh observed that private hospitals were more vulnerable to violence . \u201cWhen I started my hospital, I was advised to have security. At first, I did not feel the need for it. But, now, I need security,\u201d he said He adding that people, anyway, had gotten more aggressive these days. Avtar, who has hired private security, said guards not only regulate the traffic of patients, but also keep an eye on the behavioural pattern of relatives of a patient and warn the hospital staff accordingly. Justifying the need for bouncers, he said bills were the first and the foremost reason behind attacks on doctors. \u201cWhen it comes to paying the bill, they get hold of a local politician who instigate them for dharna. This happened with us about six months ago,\u201d he said, while suggesting that government should make stringent rules and declare violence against doctors a non-bailable offence. IMA Amritsar president Dr Inderbir Singh Nizzar said a complete shutdown would be observed on Monday. \u201cThere will be no OPD or elective surgeries, but emergency services will continue,\u201d he said. He said the IMA had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, proposing that a multifaceted approach which encompassed legislation, security, data collection, training and public awareness.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

TOI on Thursday talked to a section of farmers in Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts who hailed the government\u2019s announcement but at the same time they were apprehensive over its implementation and were of view that the assurances would go haywire during peak load hours. Notably, paddy sowing has begun in Punjab from Thursday after chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh advanced the date of paddy sowing to June 13 from earlier June 20. \u201cThere was no electricity problem on the first day, we are happy, but the condition may not remain the same in tje coming days,\u201d Lakhbir Singh, a farmer from Nizampur village said.

The crop is expected to be transplanted on nearly 28 lakh hectares, down from 31.4 lakh hectares last season. Though activists of three farm organisations had started transplanting paddy from June 1, the state agriculture and farmer welfare department had fixed June 13 as the date for starting paddy transplantation. The state government\u2019s efforts to dissuade farmers to do away with water-guzzling paddy varities has borne some fruit as there has been an increase in acreage under maize and cotton. Last season, basmati was grown on 5.46 lakh hectares and the area is expected to rise to 7 lakh hectares. In the previous season, cotton was sown over 2.83 lakh hectares and this has risen to 4 lakh hectares this year. Maize was sown in 1.1 lakh hectares last season, and is expected to be sown on 1.6 lakh hectares this time. Agriculture experts say paddy grown on an acre of land consumes nearly 60 lakh litres of water till harvesting, with a kg of paddy using up nearly 2,500 litres. As there are no rain so far and the weather is mostly dry, farmers are expected to draw underground water. In 2018, paddy transplantation started from June 20, but the date was advanced by a week this year after an announcement by Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh at a rally organised for the Lok Sabha elections. Agriculture scientists and water conservationists did not take kindly to the decision. The notification for paddy transplantation was issued by additional chief secretary Viswajeet Khanna on June 4. According to Punjab agriculture secretary Kahan Singh Pannu and director Sutantar Kumar, the department is geared up for paddy transplantation. There is some solace that area under water-guzzling paddy is expected to decrease to some extent and it is expected to increase under basmati rice, which uses less water.

The message reached the Attari station master and was communicated to the railway ministry, which in turn informed the external affairs ministry (MEA) for necessary instructions,\u201d divisional railway manager, Firozpur division, Rajesh Aggarwal told TOI. \u201cHowever, the MEA denied permission for the train to pick up the pilgrims, stating that it was not a properly routed proposal,\u201d Aggarwal added. So, the pilgrims who have permission to enter Pakistan only on train have no recourse now unless the two countries give them permission to visit Pakistan by road. The trip, as of now, is unlikely to ahead. Even Samjhauta Express only runs between India and Pakistan twice a week. The Sikh pilgrims had arrived at Attari international border on Friday morning to board the special train that was to arrive at Attari international railway station from Pakistan. However, the Pakistani train remained stationed at Wagah (Pakistan) railway station as it did not get permission to enter India. The denial of permission to the train caused resentment among the pilgrims who staged a demonstration at Attari international railway station and criticized the central government for allegedly creating obstacles in performing their religious rituals. The long wait for permission and no information on the Indian side led to fraying tempers and anger amongst the pilgrims. Talking to TOI, an elderly Sikh devotee, Darshan Singh said nobody knew why India was not giving permission to the train to enter Attari. \u201cWe have been told that train has come up to Wagah railway station and is waiting for permission from the Indian side,\u201d he said and added that everyone was highly disappointed as now they would not be able to undertake pilgrimage to Pakistan. \u201cDeliberate attempts are being made to create obstacles in fulfilling our religious aspirations that too by our own leaders,\u201d the angry man added. Angry that \u2018Guru ki Sangat\u2019 was being harassed, another devotee, Gurdev Singh said the central government should have not allowed them to apply for visas according to the martyrdom anniversary programme chalked by Pakistan on the basis of Nanakshahi calendar adopted in 2003. \u201cThey should have stopped us earlier. Now visas have been issued and we are ready to board the train but Indian Railways is not allowing it to enter India,\u201d he said. Leader of Nankana Sahib Sikh Yatree Jatha, Swaran Singh Gill, said he along with other Sikh devotees was highly disappointed on returning from Attari. Former PSGPC president Bishan Singh told TOI over phone from Wagah that a lot of senior PSGPC office-bearers as well as the Evacuee Trust Property Board officials were waiting for the Sikh jatha at Wagah. He said that India should have given entry to the Pakistani train so that the devotees could observe the martyrdom anniversary pending solution on the contentious Nanakshahi Calendar issue.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The NDRF is the premier body for rescue and relief operations in case of calamities, manmade and nature, in the country. NDRF 7th Battalion commandant Ravi Kumar told TOI on Tuesday that the operation to retrieve Fatehveer, who died after being rescued from borewell after five days, could not termed a \u201cfailed operation\u201d. \u201cThough NDRF does not have much expertise in handling such situations (of retrieving a baby from a borewell), we did our best. Central agencies do not leave anything to chance and we too made sincere efforts, though without success. We don\u2019t blame anybody or ourselves; it is only the circumstances which came in the way of the operation,\u201d he said. The operation to rescue Fatehveer has been criticized over the direction of a parallel pit, which was dug to pull out the boy, changing. Before this, the NDRF\u2019s 7th Batallion, which is headquartered in Bathinda, had faced only one incident in which a child had fallen in a borewell. Kumar said the NDRF would analyse the shortcomings of the operation, if any, to find out how standard operating procedure for such situations could be improved. Kumar refuted allegations that the NDRF team did not even have a compass to know the exact direction for digging the parallel put. He said the team was \u201cfully-equipped and compasses were present even in mobile phones\u201d. Two assistant commandants of NDRF supervised the operation running over 5 days, with a team of 25 jawans. Kumar said that NDRF got information about the incident in the evening of June 6 and the team had reached Bhagwanpura village near Sunam by 7pm. He said the operation was \u201cvery tricky\u201d. \u201cOur assistant commandant Ajay Verma remained concentrated on the operation for four days and only then we sent the other team led by another assistant commandant, Om Parkash Bishnoi, to provide some rest to the first team,\u201d the commandant added. \u201cEarlier, our men tried to pull the boy by a rope. But, when all such efforts did not bear fruit, we decided to dig a parallel bore with the full consent of district administration, family and those present,\u201d he added. The commandant said the direction of the second bore changed as the soil was sandy. He, however, dismissed rumours that the NDRF was not given full freedom and Dera Sacha Sauda volunteers and villagers obstructed them. Kumar fell back on the adage \u201cprevention is better than cure\u201d. \u201cWe need to take care that unmanned borewells are plugged to avoid another such incident,\u201d he said. \u2018Borewell narrower where kid was stuck\u2019Assistant commandant Ajay Verma, who commanded the operation for four days, said the borewell had a nine-inch diameter at the mouth, but it narrowed down to six inches where the bot was stuck. \u201cHe was entangled so badly that only his hands were visible. On the very first day, we tried to pull him out with a rope, but there was no vacuum to hold him. We tried to pull him from hands, but that was unsuccessful too. The parallel pit was dug to extract from the other side, but that too not worked well either and only created vacuum to pull him from the main bore,\u201d he said.

Talking to TOI on Wednesday, Nizzar said there was indiscipline in the party from top to bottom.

Meanwhile, arguments could not take place in the court of additional district and session judge Harbans Singh Neki on the anticipatory bail application of then DSP Baljit Singh and the matter was adjourned to June 12. The court, on June 6, had accepted the anticipatory bail of Pannu but rejected the anticipatory bail of Pandher. The special investigations team (SIT) had on May 28 filed the chargesheet in Kotkapura police firing case in court against five policemen and ex-MLA Mantar Singh Brar. The charges, including attempt to murder, had been filed against then Ludhiana police commissioner Umranangal, ex-SSP Sharma, Pannu, Baljit Singh, Pandher and Brar.

While talking to TOI on Monday Suresh Babu, director, rivers, wetlands and water policy, WWF-India informed that to further the cause of conservation of Indus water dolphins, they needed to develop the management plan for the conservation of dolphins by involving local community and engaging them to be custodians of dolphins. For the first time in December 2007, dolphins were sighted in the Hairke Wildlife Sanctuary. The authorities had then spotted two dolphins which were believed to be either a mating pair or a mature one with its young one. Dolphins are an indicator species of healthy river systems. India is one of the few countries in the world that has two fresh water dolphin species - the Gangetic River dolphin and the Indus river dolphin, sub-species of South Asian river dolphin. Indus river dolphins are found in the Indus river system and the river Beas is their only habitat in the country. The river dolphin is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). On the present count of dolphins in Beas Conservation Reserve, senior project officer WWF Geetanjali Kanwar informed that in the last survey the direct count was of four dolphins including three adults and a calve . Suresh added that population prediction of dolphins could be between five to eight. Project officer informed that they had proposed the forest department to recommend the state government for declaring dolphins as state aquatic Animals. Suresh informed that DCB Bank and WWF-India had announced a partnership to conserve the dolphins in Beas Conservation Reserve while working closely with the department of forests and wildlife preservation. \u201cWe will implement initiatives around education, awareness and community led conservation to protect the species and its habitat and ensure conservation measures for its long term survival,\u201d said he.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood.

He said Kolkata incident had forced him to rethink over his hospital\u2019s security. \u201cPresently we have just around half a dozen unarmed guards but now I am thinking to hire private security\" said he adding that Nursing Homes cell of IMA, Amritsar was holding a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issue in detail. Director, Cardiology, Fortis hospital Dr Arun Chopra observed that the violence against doctors was on rise especially in past couple of years. He said they had around 35 to 40 unarmed security personals out of which only about 12 to 15 were present in the hospital at any given time. \u201cBut they are insufficient to handle a frenzied mob of even fifty persons\u201d he said. The Kolkata incident had rejuvenated their worst fears about their own and their family\u2019s security, he added. He also agreed that if government failed to provide security cover to doctors they would be left with no option but to hire their own private security. The Times of India on Sunday visited a few private hospitals to find private security guards deployed at various places in plain clothes, even a few posing as patients, doctors practising with their licensed weapons. Doctors were collectively of view that poor infrastructure in government hospitals often forces patients to rush to private hospitals and many of them were not able to bear the high cost of treatment and in case of patient\u2019s death of a patient, the kins didn\u2019t wish to pay the pending bills and start blaming doctors for their negligence. \u201cOften these kind of people are sheltered by some local politicians who instigate them to stage dharna against the hospital and mount pressure on the hospital management to waive off their remaining bill\u201d said a doctor who didn\u2019t wish to give his name. Managing director Medicity, Dr Avtar Singh observed that private hospitals were in unorganised sector so they were vulnerable to violence. \u201cWhen I started my hospital, I was advised to have security in the hospital but I denied but now I realise that I need security\" said he adding that even the aggression in the society had increased over the years. Avtar who has his own private security said that the guards not only regulate the traffic of patients but also keep an eye on the behavioural pattern of relatives of a patient and warns the hospital staff accordingly. While justifying having bouncers by the doctors, he opined that first and the foremost reason behind attack on doctors and hospital was payment of bills. \"When it comes on paying the bill, they get hold of a local politician who instigate them for dharna etc. this has happened with us at Medicity about six months ago\u201d said he while suggesting that government had to make stringent of the rules and declare violence against doctors as a non bailable. Meanwhile president IMA, Amritsar Dr Inderbir Singh Nizzar informed that a complete shout down would be observed on Monday. \u201cThere will be no OPD or elective surgeries but emergency services will continue\u201d, he said.

The revelation was made by the girl before a member of National Commission for Women (NCW), who visited the rape survivor for personal hearing. The victim told the NCW member that her father had sold her to two women who handed her over to some persons who kept on raping her for over two months. It was after sexual exploitation for over two months that the girl had returned home, filed a complaint and the rape case was registered. The rape survivor, her mother and maternal grandfather on the evening of June 3 had appeared before Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who held a hurriedly convened press conference along with them. But then neither the girl nor the family members had spoken about her father selling her, instead they had accused the police and some Congress leaders of harassing them. Now, after the truth coming to fore, the name of rape victim\u2019s father has been added to the case and he has been arrested. However, NCW member Shayamala S Kundar accused the police of mishandling the case and remaining insensitive towards the plight of a harried girl and her family. She has directed the Bathinda SSP to seek explanation from the police officials involved in the case and provide report in two days. She also asked the SSP to provide report to the NCW on a weekly basis and arrest all the guilty in the case. Taking on the Congress leaders, Harsimrat Badal on Tuesday night had tweeted, \u201cSpoke to NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma.

The women handed her over to some persons who kept on raping her for over two months and she somehow came back to Bathinda on March 23 and filed the FIR.\u201d She said that she found that police did not sensitively investigate the matter and did not take the missing complaint as seriously as it should have. \u201cThey should have traced the girl. The FIR was also registered only after medical examination was conducted, and proper treatment was not provided as the girl even today feels the pain. I have recommended proper treatment and also held discussions with the district legal authorities and have asked them to prepare a case for financial assistance to the rape survivor.\u201d Bathinda SSP Nanak Singh, who accompanied the NCW member, said that as per the statement recorded by the rape survivor, her father has been included in the case and arrested. \u201cApart from him, main accused in the case Azad, and three others Amarjit Kaur, Rani and Deepak have also been arrested,\u201d he said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Our brother Sukhpreet Budda, to teach them a lesson, made two attempts to attack them in a day in Canada.\u201d It is learnt that during a visit to Punjab, Rehan was asked to pay a ransom of Rs 20 lakh on March 16 this year. The call had been made through internet. When he approached the police, a voice message was sent to Rahan and he was warned that the police would not save him all the time and he would be attacked either in India or Canada. Police had been following Budda gang ever since. Sukhpreet Budda, a wanted gangster in Punjab, was with Dilpreet Baba, when an attack was made on singer Parmeesh Verma in Mohali in the past. Budda is also accused of threatening Punjabi singer Gippy Grewal. However, some time after this post, a Facebook page named Sukhpreet Budda said the attack was not carried out by the gang. That post even went on to call such attacks \u201ccheap\u201d. Punjab Police organised crime control unit (OCCU) IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, when contacted, confirmed that the NRI had gotten a ransom call while visiting Punjab. \u201cWe put the gang on surveillance and provided security to the NRI, and had given them same instructions when they were returning to Canada. We have got to know about the Budda group taking responsibility for the attack on them in Canada. We are in the loop of developments. Now, we are verifying the contents of the post on Facebook as it is learnt to be operated from out of India. Canadian police are also investigating the matter and we are ready to provide any information they need,\u201d the IG said. He said their team had gotten in touch with the NRIs and they were safe and sound. \u201cSukhpreet Budda is one of the few gangsters left in Punjab and he is on the radar of Punjab Police,\u201d said the IG.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting.

The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

One such measures at sustainable water management is its latest attempt at promoting drip irrigation in maize crop. The state agriculture and farmer welfare department has fixed a target for sowing maize: 1.50 lakh hectare. A pilot project of micro irrigation on maize crop will be taken up in 1,000 acre this season under state government\u2019s ambitious project Tandrust Punjab. Maize sowing had been on decline in Punjab over the years. The reason why the state government has fixed a target to increase acreage under maize in Punjab. In 2012-13 and 2013-14, the maize was sown in 1.31 lakh hectare, in 2014-15 it was 1.26 lakh hectare, in 2015-16 1.27 lakh, in 2016-17 1.16 lakh and in 2017-18 the maize was sown in 1.14 lakh hectare with production of 4.10 lakh metric tonne. This season\u2019s production target stands at 5.70 lakh tonne. Mission director of Tandrust Punjab, KS Pannu, who is also secretary Punjab agriculture, said, \u201cOut of 1,000 acre of maize under drip irrigation, 900 acre will be on surface drip system and 100 acre will be sub-surface drip system. Four micro irrigation companies will demonstrate drip irrigation on an area of 10 acre each to show farmers how water can be conserved through drip irrigation and also to prevail them upon to adopt the drip irrigation system.\u201d Pannu said that department officials have been directed to promote alternative methods of crop watering in the wake of serious water resource challenge the state is likely to face in the coming years. According to soil conservation officials, drip irrigation not only conserves water but it also increases yield. Experts from Punjab Agricultural University said that they have successfully conducted experiments of sub-surface drip irrigation system on maize, wheat and moong and that it should be promoted on mass scale. It is to be mentioned here that a pilot campaign of micro irrigation on cotton was also undertaken this season by soil conservation department, under which 200 acre of cotton crop has been brought under drip irrigation.

Sirsa, who is the legislator from Rajouri Garden, said in a press release issued here on Monday: \"It is most unfortunate to see that even 35 years after the attack on the most sacred place of humanity by the Indian government, successive governments at the Centre failed to apologize to the Sikh community for causing them wounds which have never healed.\" Sirsa, who is president of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), said there were demands for apologies for Komagata Maru and Jallianwala Bagh tragedies, but \"Sikhs and peace-loving people feel that the Indian government owes an apology for hurting feelings of all human beings\" through a \"well planned\" conspiracy. Sirsa claimed that recent reports emerging from the UK suggested that the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, was planning an attack on the Golden Temple much before it happened and had sought help of the then UK Prime Minister, Margret Thatcher, who deputed a member of the UK's Special Air Services to India to help in planning the controversial operation. \"These reports have made it clear that the motive was to target the minorities, especially the Sikhs, as she wanted to win over the confidence of the country's majority to get political mileage,\" said Sirsa.
