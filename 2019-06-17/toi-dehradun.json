The minor girl was taken to a hospital after she complained stomach ache and doctors found that she was pregnant.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Around 50% of waste produced every day is organic. The decentralized processing of organic litter in Uttarakhand is even more important. On one hand, it will reduce the requirement of land for the process, and at the same time, it will cut short the expenses required for waste collection and transportation. To ensure proper implementation of the direction, Singh has named the secretary of the urban development department as the nodal officer. The nodal officer would present an action taken report by various departments every month. Singh has stated that the work of separating wet litter (organic water) at the source itself has been decided as an innovative measure in all government colonies of the Himalayan state and instructions were to be followed with immediate effect. Under the Urban Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, it is compulsory to separate the litter \u2013 organic and inorganic \u2013 at the source itself. In addition, it is mandatory for all residential colonies, commercial institutions, hotels and restaurants situated in an area of over 5000 square metres to process, treat and dispose of biological waste through composting in their own premises.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life.

Tired of the perennial water crisis, the villagers are signing a \u2018water conservation pledge\u2019 to save at least 1,000 litres of rainwater per person during monsoon. The scarcity of water is hitting them hard - from quitting agriculture due to scarce water for irrigation to migrating. Fetching water from the base of hills is another cause of distress this summer. \u201cIn Uttarakhand, hilltops are devoid of water. As a result, we failed in getting good agricultural produce this year too. We are tired of drawing water from the base of hills. No more suffering due to shortage of water. I along with my younger brother have already made three ponds to conserve at least 3,000 litres of water during rains. We are also motivating our schoolmates to contribute in saving water,\u201d said Deepa Rawat (13) from Chaubatakhal, Pauri Garhwal. In Pokhra block of Pauri Garhwal, villagers have migrated, leaving behind just a handful land which is not helping the earth in soaking water. \u201cVillagers have migrated, and barely 8 % to 9 % land is under farming due to which water is not seeping through the earth\u2019s crust, thus, the water table has severely receded in the hills. The resources of water are constantly depleting. So, this movement was a major requirement for Himalayas,\u201d said Surender Singh Rawat, block pramukh, Pokhra, Pauri. While Pauri Garhwal (456 hectares) has witnessed its maximum forest cover getting burnt in wildfires this year after Almora (786 hectares) district, villagers are a worried lot as they feel forest fires are among top reasons behind parched summers. \u201cWater is fast evaporating in the blaze. So, forget good summers in hills now. The first layer of soil gets burnt, literally sucking up the moisture of soil. And in rainy season, the dry, useless soil gets washed away, so even during rainy season the forest is unable to soak the rainwater. We have to conserve water up here in the hills to save our ecology or else we will be forced to migrate as well,\u201d said Parvesh Kumar Sundriyal, member, district council, Pauri Garhwal. The drive which was taken up on this year\u2019s World Environment Day (June 5) has garnered support from villagers in need and hope of relief. \u201cThe fact that 500 people from various parts of hills have already committed towards water conservation through the pledge shows the dire situation in the hills. It is a myth that hills are safe from water scarcity, staying up here shows the grim reality of summers when villagers walk several kilometers just to fetch drinking water,\u201d said Sudhir Sundriyal, founder, Feel Good organisation which is motivating people to conserve water in the hills of Uttarakhand.

Except for Matador mini buses, there are hardly any other public transport options available to take people from Roorkee to nearby villages. These buses ply on two major routes \u2014 the Kaliyar route and the Manglaur route. And while these mini buses have been the sole public transport mode since the \u201990s, the service suffers from a range of issues, including overloading and poor maintenance of buses, among others. At present, an average of 8,000 passengers travel through the Kaliyar and Manglaur route on a daily basis but only 24 mini buses ply on the Roorkee-Purkazi route (via Manglaur) and only 35 buses run on the Roorkee-Roshnabad route (via Kaliyar). The lack of buses, say observers, is what leads to overloading. Further, the buses suffer from shoddy maintenance. Broken window glass panes, rickety old seats, torn seat cushions, rusted grab-handles, dimly-lit or damaged head and tail lights and poorly functional engines are common issues with these vehicles. Commuters also allege that these buses take a lot of time to cover even a short distance. \u201cKaliyar is just 8 kilometres away from Roorkee but the mini bus takes around 50 minutes for the journey. The reason is that bus drivers wait for the bus to overload before starting the trip,\u201d said Anwar Rana, a Piran Kaliyar resident. Also, there are hardly any passenger stands on the route. As a consequence, the commuters are forced to take refuge from the scorching heat or rain in the nearby shops while waiting for the bus. This is something that is also acknowledged by bus operators. \u201cThere is no passenger stand on the Kaliyar route due to which the commuters are incovenienced especially during bad weather conditions,\u201d Vinod Puri, president of mini buses\u2019 owners association told TOI. Meanwhile, Jyoti Shankar Mishra, Roorkee transport officer when queried about the issue, told TOI, \u201cDue to the ongoing Char Dham Yatra, we are busy checking vehicles coming from other states.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Chamoli boy 'fritters' his way to crack GATE": {"time": "2019-06-15 13:39:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/chamoli-boy-fritters-his-way-to-crack-gate/articleshow/69794689.cms", "description": "DEHRADUN: Selling pakoras may have become a euphemism for the rising unemployment for the opposition parties and a symbol of self-reliance for the ruling BJP, running a fritters' shop for a living didn't stop Sagar Shah from Chamoli district from pursuing his dream of cracking the General Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) examination. Shah, 23, is already an engineering graduate and took the GATE challenge to improve his CV which could fetch him a decent job. He has no intention to go out of Uttarakhand to join a PG engineering course and until he gets a job of his choice inside the state, he would stay put at his family shop of 'chai-pakora' in Piplakoti village on Rishikesh-Barinath Road. Shah achieved 8000th rank in the GATE and is hopeful that it would help him getting a job with Tehri Hydro Development Corporation Limited (THDC) which he is trying ever since he finished his graduation in engineering from a government institute in Kothiyalsain. Although the shop was started by his father, Sagar now runs it. His father is ill and he has spared his brother to concentrate on his studies. He opens it at the break of dawn and runs it till late evening, logging 12 to 13 hours every day. This routine continued even when was preparing for the GATE examination. \"Morning hours are especially crowded as people here love deep-fried pakoras for the first meal,\u201d Shah said. He started assisting his father 15 years ago and had to take command when his father fell ill when he was doing BTech. Sagar completed his schooling from government inter college in his own village where he was just an average student. It was followed by a diploma at a polytechnic collge in Dehradun and then B Tech Kothiyalsain. \u201cSince there was no one to help the family in my village I came back and decided to study here after finishing BTech,\u201d he said. While running his shop, he decided to take GATE, his engineering degree didn't get his good offers. \"I was told by several people that clearing GATE would help me, so I decided to crack it,\" he says, adding\"I would study at least two hours daily after closing the shop,\u201d he said. Burning the midnight oil finally bore fruits when the young engineer finally cleared the exams. Despite success, he has no dearth of complaints. \u201cThe quality of education is not good enough to help you clear examinations like GATE. I believe my ranking suffered because of that. There is no coaching, no good college and even after clearing the exam, I do not think that there are enough jobs,\u201d he said. Despite having cleared the test for the higher education, Shad does not want to study further, but support his family by getting a job in the hill state. \u201cI do not want to leave Uttarakhand. I want to be here and support my family,\" he said.

Six years down the line, a lot has been achieved in form of reconstruction and infrastructure. However, a lot still remains to be done as over 3,500 dead are yet to be traced, properly planned chopper services remain a challenge, and accommodating high number of pilgrims and facilities remain a concern for the authorities. Experts have also raised concern over the large-scale construction work in the valley and have termed it as an effort to \u201cdevelop a concrete jungle\u201d at Kedarnath. For the reconstruction work at Kedarnath, Rs 300 crore has already been used. Houses for 40 priests have been constructed and the work is on to complete the houses for 73 others. Retaining wall and banks have been constructed along Mandakini and Saraswati rivers. Earlier, the approach road to the temple was merely six to seven feet wide but it has now been increased to 50 feet. A grand entrance plaza greets the pilgrims who take the 50-feet-wide and 278-metre-long approach road to reach the shrine.The temple platform area had been increased from 27,000sqft to 41,000sqft. A safety wall has also been constructed behind the shrine. Rudraprayag district magistrate Mangesh Ghildiyal, who has been monitoring the development works, said, \u201cIt is because of the hard work put in by the entire team that the number of devotees is on the rise with the each passing year. We are ensuring better facilities and medical attention to pilgrims coming from different parts of the country.\u201dHe added that there are some sectors that still need attention. \u201cWe need more toilets as number of pilgrims is increasing.

People are struggling to get ticket, there is no proper system, online tickets are always booked and there is a state of utmost confusion here. This year, the chopper services started a week after the yatra began,\u201d he said. He added that the damage done to fabricated huts by heavy snowfall has \u201ccompounded the miseries of the pilgrims. \u201cUnder freezing conditions, people are being made to stay in tents.\u201d He added that more efforts were required to find the dead. \u201cSo many people come in search for their loved ones.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

A geophone is a ground motion transducer that is used by geophysicists and seismologists to convert ground movement into voltage.

Kainchi Dham had shot into the limelight after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, in an interaction with PM Modi at the Facebook headquarters in 2015, mentioned that he had visited an Indian temple on the suggestion of Apple founder Steve Jobs. The temple was later presumed to be Kainchi dham.  Jobs had visited Kainchi Dham Ashram in the 70s but didn\u2019t find Neem Karauri Baba there.  The temple\u2019s present structure was built gradually over the years after its inauguration on June 15, 1964. In 1962, the ascetic, who died on September 10, 1973, built a chabutara (platform). The current temple is based on that foundation, along the bank of Shipra river.  Popular fables recite that the saint left his home in 1958 when his youngest daughter was all of 11 years old.

Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting.

The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

In 2016 when heavy rains flooded Rispana, the river swept away many homes and part of the main street stretching from one end of the colony to the other. \u201cWe not only lost our homes then but a house also fell in the river and most of the road that ran alongside was lost too,\u201d said Ajay Kannojia, a resident. Dozens of houses in the colony are lined up along the river and the main street has parts of it literally hanging in the air. The residents say that both politicians and the administration had promised to build a retention wall and rebuild the road but nothing has been done for the past three years. \u201cJust a week ago, another part of the road fell into the river. This is happening even before the rains have arrived. We can\u2019t even imagine when will happen if the 2016 disaster recurs,\u201d said Vijendra Tyagi, a resident. Jaiprakash, another resident, added that cracks on the road have become wider. \u201cThough much of the road hangs in the air, we would still use it as it is our main street. However, now that the cracks have become wider, we have stopped children from playing near it. This is a disaster in the waiting.\u201d The area had got public attention last year after Mussoorie MLA Ganesh Joshi, who was on an inspection, had stumbled on the narrow passage and almost fell into the river. He had then promised that he would solve the problem. \u201cAfter that incident, even the district magistrate visited the area to look into the matter. But almost a year has passed, and nothing has changed,\u201d Jaiprakash said. Ganesh Joshi when contacted and reminded of his promise, said that funds were not available with the irrigation department then to build the retention walls. \u201cHowever, now I have spoken to the irrigation department officials and they said that Rs 3 crore will be given by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) to repair the damages. We hope to finish the work before monsoons,\u201d Joshi said.

Of the 28 candidates, nearly 25 are new faces, with a thrust on active political workers rather than greenhorns from the glamour world. The saffron party, which bagged two Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 elections, is now targeting 23 of the state's 42 constituencies. BJP Lok Sabha first full listUnlike the TMC list, which had 18 new faces and a mix of both old-timers and greenhorns, hardcore politicians and personalities from the film industry, the BJP has put faith on its own leaders and defectors from other parties. There are four women candidates and one Muslim nominee in the first list. Of the candidates, five had recently defected to the saffron party from the Trinamool Congress and one from the CPI(M). West Bengal: Track here Lok Sabha elections' full coverageUnion minister and BJP MP from Asansol Lok Sabha constituency Babul Supriyo has been renominated from the same seat and is pitted against actor Moon Moon Sen of the TMC. State BJP president Dilip Ghosh will contest from Medinipur seat against TMC leader Manas Bhunia. BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha will take on TMC heavyweight Sudip Bandopadhyay in Kolkata North Lok Sabha seat.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli. In Video:No Murli Manohar Joshi in BJP list of 43Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}}
