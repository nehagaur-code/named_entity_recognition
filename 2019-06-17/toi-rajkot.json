Jet airways was flying two daily flights from the city. The airport authority is struggling hard to convince private operators to fill the space left vacant by Jet Airways. Rajkot airport director A N Sharma has shot a letter to Spice Jet and IndiGo Airlines 15 days ago showing the two operators the potential of getting good traffic and reduction in costs. Talking to TOI, Sharma said, \u201cI have given a picture of industrial sectors in the city, the possible number of travellers and how traffic was when six flights were operating in a day from the city.\u201d The airport authority has given them a list of destination which are in highly demand from the city including Mumbai, Delhi and Surat. The airport authority, which had plans of constructing a new apron, has started renovating the old one to provide night parking facility to the aircraft. It is also pursuing the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to give it permission to commission the closed 100 metre area of runway so as to allow operators to fly with full capacity and thereby reduce operating costs. According to the authority, the old apron which has the capacity of parking one big and one small aircraft will be ready in 45 days, while the new apron which has the capacity of parking four big aircraft will be ready in 90 days. Talking to TOI, Sharma said \u201cWe will be able to provide parking facility to four aircraft \u2014 something that will definitely attract private operators to start flights from Rajkot, because the parking charges in Rajkot is also very less compared to big cities like Mumbai and Delhi.\u201d Sharma explained the huge difference in parking charges by showcasing that of Mumbai airport which collects Rs 50,000 per night per big aircraft, while Rajkot airport collects only Rs 2,000 for the same. Rajkot airport will have capacity of parking five aircraft, of which four will be allowed night halt. Currently there is no facility to park any aircraft for the night. According to sources, private operators are reluctant to start operation because of \u2018Load Penalty\u2019 \u2014 which means that the aircraft can\u2019t take off with full capacity. In this case, an aircraft having capacity of 180 passenger have to take off with 140 to 150 passengers only as the runway is short. The airport authority has been waiting for the past eight months to get permission to use the 100 metre runway which is still closed after recarpeting. If the DGCA gives its nod, aircraft can use the whole 1,842 metre runway allow it to operate with full capacity thereby reducing the operational cost. Box Air India to suspend operation for four days in a week The demand for connectivity to Mumbai is very high from Rajkot. However, only one flight operates once in a day to Mumbai, which too will temporarily curb its operation from July to September. Air India informed the Rajkot airport authority that it will operate Mumbai flight only on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday from July 2 to September 15, instead of the daily flight. The decision stems from the state-run operators need to meet the demand of Hajj pilgrims, said sources.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me.

It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "200 years on Allah Bund quake continues to intrigue scientists": {"datetime": "", "description": "RAJKOT: Gujarat escaped cyclone\u2019s devastation, but on Sunday it will be reminded of a cataclysmic shaking of the earth that totally changed the topography of Kutch desert. On June 16, it will be exactly 200 years to \u2018Allah Bund,\u2019 considered as the biggest earthquake to hit the Indian sub-continent. The tremblor, which created a ridge 90 km long, 16km wide and 3-4 m high in Greater Rann - all in less than a minute - continues to intrigue geologists and earth scientists event today. On Sunday, nearly 40 experts, including those from foreign countries, will converge at the Shyamji Krushna Verma Kutch University, to discuss this rare seismic phenomenon. \u201cThe earthquake was the strongest in Indian earthquake history and one of the greatest in intra-plate earthquakes of the world,\u201d said Professor M G Thakkar of the department of earth and environmental science, Kutch university, while talking to TOI. \u201cApart from the 90 km long ridge, the major revenue collection centre \u2013 the Sindri fort \u2013 was also devastated and many vessels and ships had been destroyed near the channel that led to the Kori creek. Rice fields near the Sunda region at Lakhpat also affected and inundated by the sea water,\u201d said Thakkar. who asserts that no earthquake reported thereafter has made such huge topographical changes. \u201cN early 1000sq km land subsided by four metres. There was subsidence on the north and south sides too, while a port that existed ahead of Kori creek too subsided,\u201d he added. Scientists will study and analyze the magnitude of this disaster and visit the epicentre on Sunday. The national-level workshop on the intra-plate earthquake has been organized by the Department of Earth and Environment Science of Kutch University and Seismological Research, Gandhinagar. Most of these experts have worked on the 1819 earthquake and its co-seismic deformation and also continue to work on it. Experts will deliberate on Palaeoseismic studies of 1819 \u2018Allah Bund\u2019 earthquake and comment on quaternary landscape evolution of the western great Rann of Kutch and structures and active tectonics and seismotectonics of \u2018Allah Bund\u2019 fault. Talking about the purpose of the workshop, Thakkar said: \u201cThe amount of study produced on 1819 Allah Bund earthquake is very less. The earlier studies by Burnes (1826, 1828), Oldham (1926) and the verbal reports in the gazetteer, besides some early notes by international travellers give us vague ideas of the severity of the earthquake.\u201d He further said that the active interactions of existing experts\u2019 understanding of the Allah Bund and fresh research ideas of young earth scientists will open up innovative research windows for the less understood domains of Rann of Kutch.

They have been identified as Mehrdad Timaji, Mohammad Raeisi Jahromi, Babak Hajiani, Ebrahim Omidi and Sajjad Masoudi. As per law if any crew abandons the ship, the marine police takes them into custody. However, the procedure to bring them on land from the sea is a labyrinthine process. Therefore, Gujarat Marine Police informed the shipping company which appointed a legal agent to handle with their transfer procedures. According to International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) sources, after the intervention of Kandla Seafarers Welfare Association (KSWA), these six men can now go back to their country within 2-3 days. A cargo ship from Iran reached Mul Dwarka port a few days ago. This GMB operated port is majorly used for importing coal and exporting cement. However, looking at the cyclonic situation and to avoid damages to the jetty from docked vessels, the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) asked the MV Seashell to go back to mid sea. However, these six crew members, who are Iranian nationals, refused to go back with their ship claiming it to be \u2018defective\u2019. According to Mukesh Vasu, administrator of the KSWA, who is also helping these six men reach home, After the ship returned to its country of origin, the family members of these six missing crew members informed the ITF and we started a search. Vasu is also ITF inspector at Kandla. In the meantime an owner of a tug which goes to supply cargo to the ship informed police that six Iranian crew members were on board the tug for the last five days. \u201cThe police then informed GMB which instructed the tug to keep the men inside the tug,\u201d said Vasu. \u201cThe shipping company has appointed an agent who is completing the formalities and the six men will return home within two-three days.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

While the Western Railway blamed the state government for not acquiring private land for the project, the Gujarat government accused the railways for not publishing the notification of the total land required for the project in different districts \u2014 Surendranagar, Morbi and Rajkot. This comes at a time when Saurashtra\u2019s financial hub is facing severe air connectivity issue as there are only two daily flights from the city to Mumbai and Delhi. The doubling of railway tracks is to be on the 116km stretch between Surendranagar and Rajkot. The project got sanction in 2017-18 with completion target set for 2020-21. Sources in the railways said that since the project began, track doubling has been completed for just 9km stretch. They also admitted that at the current pace of work, it is not possible to complete the work within the targeted time limit. The first step of the project was land acquisition in Surendranagar, Morbi and Rajkot districts. Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) member Parth Ganatra said, \u201cThe major problem is land acquisition. The railways blame state government for not acquiring the land and state government blames railways for not following the procedure. The Western Railway general manager who visited Rajkot eight months back also blamed the state government for delaying the project.\u201d Ganatra, who is also vice-president of Rajkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI), added, \u201cAs Rajkot is developing rapidly we are facing severe connectivity problems. We don\u2019t have enough flights from Rajkot and the rail connectivity with other states is also very poor.\u201d Recently, two flight from Rajkot were terminated after crisis at Jet Airways. The Airport Authority of India is also in talks with other airlines but because of short runway the airlines are reluctant to commence operations from Rajkot. Meanwhile, there are many pending demands calling for increase in frequency of Okha-Dehradun Express, Rajkot-Ujjain Express and other trains connecting north and south Indian states apart from regular demand for trains to Mumbai and Delhi. The ceramic hub Morbi is also dependent on Rajkot for the connectivity with the rest of the country. Surendranagar collector K Rajesh said, \u201cIn the first phase, railways had demanded 10-hectare land of which we have acquired 9.7 hectare. Railways needs total 42 hectare land in Surendranagar but they have not published in the gazette their requirement of land and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t initiate land acquisition process.\u201d The maximum land that railway now requires is private land that is to be acquired according to the act. Ravindra Srivastav, senior divisional commercial manager of Rajkot division, said, \u201cInitially, it was a land acquisition problem which is why work got delayed. Thereafter, we could not send the request for publishing notification in gazette because of the model code of conduct. Now, we hope in next 10-15 days we would be able to complete that procedure.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Priyanka-Nick": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/priyanka-chopra-prefers-this-dancing-partner-over-husband-nick-jonas/videoshow/69812425.cms", "description": ""}, "Palanpur: Two kids die in house fire": {"time": "2019-06-11 08:39:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/two-kids-die-in-house-fire/articleshow/69731743.cms", "description": "PALANPUR: Two children \u2014 an infant and a toddler\u2014 die of severe burn injuries on Sunday evening when a hut caught fire in Vedla village about 20 km from Amirgadh town of Banaskantha.

Not only has it seen many spells of droughts, the ground water here is also very salty with high TDS levels, thanks to sea water seepage. Therefore, residents were forced to remain totally dependant on the Jamnagar Municipal Corporation (JMC) for supply of Narmada water. However, city gets water on alternate days and that too, for 20 minutes only. Again, the force too is very low. Hence, residents faced immense hardships for two to three months in the peak summer months till monsoon arrive. At this point, non-profit organization, Navanagar Nature Club, decided to solve the city\u2019s water crisis through experimentation. It tried to rejuvenate the borewells by recharging them with fresh water and started with Patel colony and Punchvati \u2013 two posh, but dry areas of the city \u2014 located barely 12km from the sea shore. The experimentation bore fruit and they could rejuvenate 1,276 borewells in these localitites. Nitish Kesaria, a businessman from the colony said, \u201cCorporation supply was really insufficient in fulfilling our daily need for water and so we have to depend on other sources. This technique of recharging borewells have worked well with us and we are self-sufficient now.\u201d The club then organized awareness camps in various other areas of the city to sensitize people about how to recharge dry borewells and its volunteers, comprising civil engineers, also gave interested people free advice on how to go about with it. President and founder of the club, Vijay Jadeja said, \u201cThe ground water level was as deep as 100 feet and with very high TDS levels rendering it unfit for consumption. Our members guided plumbers how to recharge the borewells successfully.\u201d Himanshu Jani, a member of the club and also the president of Jamnagar\u2019s federation of architect and civil engineers association, said, \u201cAfter recharging borewells to suffice till monsoon, people reap benefits after the first monsoon rain itself. The rain water collected on the terraces is diverted to the borewell through pipes. We make a screen chamber of gravel and 10 to 20 mm metal to filter out impurities from the water, which then recharges the underground water.\u201d The water condition in the cityAfter Ranjit Sagar dam dried up in January, Jamnagar city was left totally dependant on Narmada water. The Und and Sasoi dam too dried up, leaving the city with a population of nearly 7.5 lakh people requiring 110 MLD (million litre per day), severely parched.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said.

Sometimes the jeep drivers divert their vehicles from assigned routes to find big cats in other areas, if they are not easily spotted on the designated routes. Now, this diversion will not be possible as the movement of the vehicles will be monitored from the control room. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani inaugurated this monitoring unit on Tuesday. According to a statement issued by the department, radio collars will be fitted on 100 lions, which are currently moving in the outside the forest area, especially in Amreli and Bhavnagar districts. These lions have been traced to areas near human habitation. Thus, the forest department can keep a close watch on these big cats with the help of these radio collars. A control room is being set up to get output of all the CCTV cameras that have been installed on the check posts across the routes routes of the forest areas. The department also purchased 250 wireless sets that will be provided to its personnel in deep forest areas where mobile connectivity is very low.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.
