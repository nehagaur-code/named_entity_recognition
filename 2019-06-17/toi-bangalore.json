{"In two months, BBMP nets 45% property tax": {"datetime": "", "description": "BENGALURU: The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is inching towards meeting its property tax collection target, having mopped up 45% of it in just over two months of this financial year. Till June 12, the civic agency had collected Rs 1,581.7 crore as property tax, an all-time high. The collection in the first two months of previous years was Rs 784 crore in 2016-17, Rs 967 crore in 2017-18 and Rs 1,167 crore in 2018-19. Of the around 19 lakh property owners in the city, 9.5 lakh have paid tax. The biggest challenge before BBMP now is to bring the others into the tax net. In April, property owners made use of the 5% rebate and paid Rs 873 crore as tax, up from the Rs 650 crore collected during the corresponding period last year. According to information available with TOI, the Mahadevapura zone has overtaken BBMP\u2019s east zone in property tax collection and tops the list. Mahadevapura was trailing the east zone in April. While it now accounts for a collection of Rs 383.4 crore, the east zone stands at the second spot with Rs 321.3 crore. Dasarahalli zone is at the bottom with Rs 45 crore. Adopting GEPTIS technology, BBMP has identified around 18.9 lakh properties in its limits. Nearly 3 lakh are vacant sites and most of their owners don\u2019t pay taxes. The Palike is unable to locate the owners and make them tax compliant. \u201cIn 2018-19, around 12.4 lakh property owners paid taxes. Even if BBMP is not able to trace vacant site owners who have not been complying, it should make sustained efforts to bring the remaining 4 lakh property owners into the tax net. If this can be done, taxpayers\u2019 ranks will swell up to 16 lakh,\u201d a BBMP official said. BBMP sources said it had aimed at collecting Rs 4,100 crore as property tax during 2019-20 but downsized the target to Rs 3,500 crore after the government revised its budget. Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun has sought information pertaining to collection of property tax under various heads like collection from residential, commercial, A Khata, B Khata and mixed properties among others.

He said the coalition government has taken steps to unearth the truth by forming a Special Investigation Team. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough. It should provide justice to investors. Victims of many such past cases are waiting even now,\u201d he said in an open letter to Kumaraswamy. He said the chief minister should personally monitor the case by appointing an ombudsman and set up a special court to try scams, like the IMA one, to ensure legal procedures are completed at the earliest. Patil said the government should try these cases under the new ordinance (Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Ordinance, 2019) promulgated by the Centre in February to curb Ponzi schemes and protect small investors. It\u2019s valid till August and may become an Act in the upcoming Parliament session. It allows a special court to complete legal procedures of attachment, realisation and distribution of proceeds to depositors within 180 days from the date of filing an application by a competent authority. It also targets black money or unaccounted-for funds which get converted into legitimate assets. He added that it would prevent gullible investors from getting fleeced and also plug many gaps in current laws. It not only helps depositors but also the government in limiting conversion of black money into white. The government should take steps to create awareness among the poor who, lured by high interest rates, fall prey to such schemes, he said.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The school\u2019s Kannada medium section has only two in its class. The enrolment figures are similar at a government school in JP Nagar, Bengaluru. A growing belief that English-medium education opens up more possibilities for children has triggered a significant shift in attitudes in poor families, which traditionally preferred Kannada as the mode of learning for reasons ranging from ease of communication to continuation of the local culture. The change has been evident in the falling enrolments at Kannada medium schools for some time, and the state has now taken it as the cue for promoting English in classrooms. English medium sections have been started at dozens of government Kannada schools across Karnataka this year, and officials have received a deluge of admission requests, in many cases, more than they can allow or process. For example, 14 government schools in Bengaluru South have received 290 applications for class 1 English medium and 90 in lower KG. They have not received any for the same grade in Kannada medium. Chief minister HD Kumaraswamy has strongly endorsed the push for English. Experts say the measure is necessary to keep government and aided schools open and relevant. In 2018, 28,847 such schools, which lacked English medium, shut down as they didn\u2019t have enough students to run classes. The Right to Education (RTE) Act provided many poor families an opportunity to place their kids in private institutions, which they otherwise cannot afford. But only a certain number of poor students can be accommodated in private schools through RTE. This created space for the state to step in and draw parents back with a pitch for English education. Kumaraswamy announced the launch of 1,000 English medium sections at government schools. The model, it seems, has been borrowed from Kerala. Kannada medium schools with English sections are now called Kannada Public Schools, and the government has deployed 1,443 teachers there. The number of students per class in English medium has been limited to 30, which has upset parents whose wards are currently outside this cutoff. The average student-teacher ratio is 20:1. Currently, 973 English medium sections are functional and 23 are in the pipeline. Additionally, 300 are being introduced in the existing pool of English medium sections because of the high demand. An official with the state department of public instruction (DPI) said more students would have applied for or joined classes had the government announced the decision before April. But the impetus to English learning has touched off a debate with many saying it will cause irreparable damage to Kannada medium. SG Siddaramaiah, the chairman of Kannada Development Authority, has been one of the most of vocal critics. Giving the issue a political colour, he said a regional party that should be protecting the local language and culture was taking detrimental steps. \u201cThe previous governments extended full support to the development of Kannada. It\u2019s extremely disappointing that a regional party, which should be making efforts to keep the local language relevant for Kannada asmithe (Kannada pride), is introducing English medium and bulldozing opposition to it,\u201d he said. But Kumaraswamy told TOI that the decision to open English medium divisions would not have any impact on Kannada sections. \u201cDefinitely not. We are not against Kannada medium schools, and the government is not ready to close them,\u201d he said. The push towards English, the chief minister said, was part of a larger effort to improve the quality of education in Karnataka. \u201cLast year, over 40 lakh children in government schools were assessed for learning levels. Based on the outcome, various measures are being taken to improve their learning abilities. Teachers are being trained, and over Rs 1,000 crore is being spent on improving infrastructure, etc. So, I believe that these initiatives would definitely pay rewards in future,\u201d he said in a response to queries sent by TOI. Kumaraswamy added that the English initiative would cater to aspirations of economically backward families which cannot afford to send their children to private schools. \u201cWe have received an overwhelming response from parents and requests to begin additional sections in certain schools. We will take a decision based on the availability of trained teachers,\u201d he said.

The state government, however, cited legalities and constitutional propriety, which prevent such meetings from being held under public glare.

Joining the Mattar Blue movement, which has taken social media platforms by storm, Bengalureans are changing their profile pictures to raise awareness about the Sudan crisis and show solidarity with the people of the African nation. In Sudan, protesters are demanding the transitional military council hand over the power to a civilian government. Last week, the country\u2019s security forces opened fire on unarmed protesters holding a sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum. Doctors and activists said over 100 people have been killed since. What is Mattar Blue\u201cWhat happens across borders won\u2019t stay there. There was an internet shutdown in Sudan and bodies of protesters were thrown in the Nile, according to a report, but no one is talking about it anywhere in the world. At least changing DPs will pique people\u2019s curiosity and may raise awareness,\u201d said Madhu Iyer, a writer. She changed her WhatsApp DP to blue on June 7 and received many messages asking why. \u201cI usually put up quirky DPs and the change made people think something was wrong,\u201d Madhu explained. She said several of her acquaintances got to know what was happening in Sudan because of her move. According to Taj Zehra, a student, the change in DPs is not just a trend but a step towards saving humanity. \u201cIt is about raising awareness on the atrocities happening around the world. We\u2019re oblivious to them because we are so busy scrolling through unnecessary feeds,\u201d said Taj, who changed her DP on Instagram and WhatsApp. Sara Fathima, a writer, said when a French monument could get people to post status messages on solidarity, the Sudan issue deserved to be highlighted as well. \u201cIt may seem frivolous but that we are trying to draw attention to it is important,\u201d she said.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

A meeting with RBI officials has been convened next week at the behest of home minister MB Patil. \u201cWe want to fix responsibility on each and every authority. Before doing this, we need to get a proper assessment of the system and figure out gaps that need to be plugged and I hope, the meeting will be helpful in doing so,\u201d Patil said. Patil said the meeting convened by the government will be attended by various agencies and departments which are now working in silos when it comes to dealing with Ponzi schemes. Officials from the departments of revenue, home, finance and others will take inputs from RBI officials. \u201cThe objective is to create a common administrative platform to deal with such cases,\u201d Patil added. Also, the state-level coordination committee (SLCC)\u2014a joint forum to facilitate information sharing among regulators, including the RBI and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\u2014headed by the chief secretary will meet separately to discuss the IMA case. ACs\u2019 powers withdrawn in Jan Although waking up a little late, the government is mulling restoring powers to assistant commissioners (ACs) of the revenue department to confiscate assets of Ponzi firms to tackle such more efficiently. The government had withdrawn the powers given to ACs to seize properties of Ponzi companies in January this year. Just two months before that, on November 11, 2018, a public notice was issued to seize movable and immovable properties belonging to IMA Private Limited and sixteen of its associated firms. \u201cThe powers were withdrawn following the RBI instruction that action against such companies should be on case by case basis. Now, a process has been initiated to restore the powers of the competitive authority, particularly in the case of IMA Group,\u201d said Rajkumar Khatri, principal secretary to the revenue department. LC Nagaraj, revenue assistant commissioner of Bengaluru north sub-division, is the competent authority and he told TOI that he\u2019s waiting for orders. However, Nagaraj has to wait for the special investigation team (SIT) to complete its probe in the IMA case and identify its properties to be seized. \u201cThis rigmarole could have been avoided had the government allowed the ACs to confiscate properties in November 2018,\u201d a government official said. According to an estimate, Mohammad Mansoor Khan, founder-owner of IMA Group, has left behind assets close to Rs 500 crore and fled the country. The assets include 1,900kg gold jewellery, 18.64kg platinum and land. Officials, however, said they were sceptical about the outcome of the government\u2019s efforts given that several politicians and bureaucrats are soft-peddling the issue. Patil, however, said the government is sincere in providing justice to the investors. \u201cWe admit that there were some loopholes in the system. But, now we want to plug them,\u201d he said.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here.

The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19.

It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

With India taking on arch-rivals Pakistan in their World Cup league match in Old Trafford \u2014 their seventh match ever in ODI\u2019s premier competition \u2014 traffic thinned on the roads by the afternoon while the city\u2019s pubs and restaurants, all set with giant TV screens, were soon packed to the rafters. It doubtless raised spirits that India, in fine form and having won all their previous World Cup encounters with Pakistan, also had local boy KL Rahul step out to open the Indian innings with Rohit Sharma. The pair got into the groove in double quick time, and the cricket fans were in for a treat. Those who deserted the streets and weren\u2019t getting plastered while watching the game, were likely at home doing much the same. Elsewhere, the mood was close to stratospheric: While Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) made special arrangements for passengers to watch the match, the captain of a Bengaluru-Mumbai Vistara aircraft provided live updates during the flight. At M Chinnaswamy Stadium, huge crowds gathered to watch the match on the big screen. \u201cIndia vs Pakistan is the biggest of all World Cup matches,\u201d said Sagar Bhat, the proprietor of Angrezi - Bollywood Bar & Kitchen on Church Street. \u201cIt is the mother of all matches. We were overflowing with customers and, unlike usual, did not play any music as patrons wanted to follow the live telecast.\u201d Rahul Menon, a software employee, watched the match at Koramangala Social. \u201cThe match was enthralling and the pub offered exciting discounts too,\u201d he said.

The big covers came on for a while before play resumed with Pakistan set a DLS target of 302 in 40 overs. The target in the 38th over was an impossible 53 an over and India triumphed by 89 runs.

Jahangir Ghazi, a resident of Parappana Agrahara who belongs to North 24 Parganas district in West Bengal, was on Friday arrested with 1,000 tablets of Yaba, whose street name is \u2018crazy medicine\u2019, worth around Rs 10 lakh. Police said Ghazi came to Bengaluru about three years ago and had worked at various construction sites. Having learnt about the huge demand for drugs in the city, he got into peddling. He was arrested just hours after he arrived in the city with the consignment. According to sources, Ghazi met a few people from West Bengal in Parappana Agrahara, who got him into the business. \u201cAfter figuring out the profit margin was nearly 100%, he began taking orders from local dealers and supplied Yaba pills,\u201d a source said. Cops believe the drugs reached West Bengal from Myanmar via Bangladesh. They said Ghazi procured the drugs in West Bengal and smuggled them into Bengaluru. \u201cHe never took minor assignments,\u201d sources said, adding that Ghazi procured the tablets at Rs 300-Rs 400 a piece and sold them to dealers for Rs 800 or Rs 900 each. \u201cBy the time customers picked it up, the cost of the tablet was at least Rs 1,200-Rs 1,400,\u201d another source said. Police said Ghazi had rented a room in Parappana Agrahara for the past 18 months but never stayed there for more than a week at a stretch. Claiming he had confessed to having a network of dealers in West Bengal, cops said he used it to supply Yaba tablets to college students, working professionals and those organising rave parties here. He usually took a flight to West Bengal, but always opted for a train while smuggling the drugs into Bengaluru. While police had known about his business through informants, they didn\u2019t know he dealt in Yaba. An attempt to arrest him in December 2018 was unsuccessful, but that didn\u2019t deter Ghazi from continuing the business. After learning that he was coming to Bengaluru again, police officers boarded a train in Bangarpet to keep an eye on his movements. But they couldn\u2019t catch him as he was travelling in an AC compartment. A team which was stationed near his room in Parappana Agrahara managed to nab him as soon as he arrived there. CCB officers said they have not seen too many cases involving Yaba pills, adding they\u2019re making attempts to trace his distributors and ascertaining whether he was just a supplier or had a bigger role in the racket.

This, despite the CM sending a letter of appeasement along with an emissary in the form of his cabinet colleague and animal husbandry minister Venkatrao Nadagouda to the BJP camp. Police have made elaborate security arrangements to ensure the protest does not spiral into a law and order situation in the city. Early on Sunday morning, as BJP leaders led by party state president BS Yeddyurappa were preparing to gherao the CM\u2019s home office, the JD(S)-Congress coalition government made a pre-emptive effort to checkmate the opposition by sending Nadagouda along with a letter from the CM. While Nadagouda did not stay more than 30 seconds, suggesting that it was only a political move by the coalition to disrupt the BJP\u2019s plans, the letter stated Kumaraswamy was open to parleys over the land deal, IMA scam and other concerns of the opposition. \u201cThe government has taken all possible drought-mitigation measures and successfully implemented the farm loan waiver. In the case of JSW land deal, the cabinet has already referred the matter to a sub-committee. I\u2019ve taken note of your day and night protest with utmost seriousness and I\u2019m willing to have talks with you at a time of your suiting,\u201d read the letter. However, during his public speech, Yeddyurappa stated that the party need not pay heed to Kumaraswamy\u2019s \u201cfalse assurances\u201d and went ahead with the plan. This prompted Kumaraswamy to take to Twitter from New Delhi; \u201cDespite my efforts to have talks with the opposition on their concerns, the BJP has decided to gherao my office. This suggests that BJP is looking for publicity and not concerned with development issues of the state,\u201d he claimed. Drama outside Krishna As soon as around 3,000 protesters reached Kumara Krupa Road, police stopped them outside the Chitrakala Parishath premises adjoining Krishna. The leaders were swiftly detained. However, vociferous leaders tried to barge through the barricades and locked horns with police for denying their \u201cdemocratic right to protest in front of the CM\u2019s office.\u201d Police had already brought in around 10 BMTC buses and deployed a 250-strong contingent to handle the protesters. Knowing what was coming next, Yeddyurappa boarded the bus without creating a scene, and let the younger leaders hog the limelight through their defiance. MLAs like MP Renukacharya and R Ashoka desisted the cops\u2019 efforts to take them to the bus, and tried to push through the personnel waving party flags. However, they were all forced to vacate the premises. The leaders were taken to Cubbon Park and released in half an hour. Towards the end, by 1pm, the protest came to an anti-climax, much to the relief of several young workers who left the place to watch the much-anticipated India-Pakistan World Cup match.

The navtar, according to Vishnu, is a combination of Indian traditional and Western instruments which lets one play classical and Carnatic songs as well as Western jazz and oriental music. The instrument is trademarked and is awaiting patent. \u201cThough it may appear like a traditional guitar, a closer look at it will reveal a variety of design changes and modifications. For example, the most important distinction is that it has nine strings (hence, nav-tar. Nav also means unique in Sanskrit), six of which are fretted and tuned like a guitar and three additional playing strings on a fretless board, designed and tuned differently to suit Indian classical music. The sound of it is best described as a combination of a sarod, sitar and guitar. Some have even said that it offers a totally different, new sound altogether,\u201d said Vishnu, while describing the instrument, which he got custom-made from a guitar maker in Auroville, Puducherry. While delivering a talk on \u2018Innovation and Tradition\u2019 at IME, on Sunday, Vishnu pointed out how the invention stemmed from a desire to combine two of his interests \u2014 Indian classical and Western music. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important for an artist to delve deep into an art form, to it\u2019s very source, and bring out the essence and beauty of it to the listeners, while maintaining an original voice/signature of his own,\u201d said Vishnu. \u201cThere are many ideas and refinements in design I\u2019d like to execute, after which it would be a great honour for me to have the navtar housed at the IME,\u201d he said.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination.

Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) is likely to follow suit on Saturday. The move came after chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Friday asked the transport department to review the hike. The transport department\u2019s decision to increase the rates of concessional passes for students has been opposed by various students and activists. State-run bus corporations, including BMTC and KSRTC, had announced a steep hike in the fares of concessional passes between Rs 100 and Rs 250 causing severe inconvenience to several lakhs of students across the state. Members of All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) have decided to stage a demonstration at 10.30am on Saturday at Mysore Bank Circle demanding withdrawal of the hike and free bus passes for all students.While BMTC announced the hike on Thursday, KSRTC came out with it at 4.30pm on Friday but reversed it by 8pm. \u201cKSRTC is issuing student bus passes from June 19 for the academic year 2019-20. Rates are the same as those of last year,\u201d said a KSRTC release. While KSRTC sources said they decided to roll back the hike after they received an oral communication from the government, BMTC officials maintained they were waiting for an official order to take a decision. Normally, a decision taken by KSRTC, which is the parent organization of BMTC, NERTC and NWRTC, applies to the other three corporations. However, BMTC is incurring heavy losses because of its high operational costs and lack of financial assistance from the government. Sources said the chief minister\u2019s office had communicated to the transport department to reconsider the hike decision. This is the second time the CM is rolling back a transport department move. Kumaraswamy in September 2018 had reversed the decision of state road transport undertakings to increase bus fares by 18%. Members of All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) had decided to stage a demonstration at 10.30am on Saturday at Mysore Bank Circle demanding withdrawal of the hike and free bus passes for all students. \u201cWe have been betrayed by the government. Last year, Kumaraswamy had promised free bus passes for all students from this year but now they unilaterally announced a steep hike in fares,\u201d said Apoorva CM, a secretariat member of AIDSO. Prabha Dev, an activist, said: \u201cAt a time when governments across the world are making public transport free for all, our state has hiked bus pass rates for students. This reflects the skewed mobility policy the state government is adopting.\u201d Shaheen Shasa of Bengaluru Bus Prayanikara Vedike (BBPV), an NGO, said: \u201cThe increase in student pass rates will burden their parents further and make education more expensive.\u201d Former chief minister Siddaramaiah had announced free bus passes to all students across the state in the 2018-19 budget. In fact, Kumaraswamy had stated his new government would implement all programmes schemes of the previous government but the free bus pass scheme for students was silently buried. Sources say the government is reluctant to implement the scheme mainly because of the farm loan waiver. As many as 19.6 lakh students across the state were expected to benefit. While the scheme will cost around Rs 630 crore, the finance department is yet to earmark the amount. For student passes, the state government bears 50% of the total cost, while bus corporations share 25% of the burden and students pay the remaining 25%.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Revealing this in an interview with TOI, Deshpande, however, denied that he had done Khan any undue favour. TOI had on Friday reported that a Muslim politician had taken Khan to a minister to enable him to get a clean chit for his company\u2019s operations, but a senior IAS officer declined to issue the certificate despite pressure from the minister. Deshpande said it was the police department which had given IMA a clean chit after the RBI insisted that the firm\u2019s deals be looked into. Why were you particular about giving a clean chit to IMA when it was in financial distress and Mohammed Mansoor Khan was desperately trying raise funds through a bank loan?It was not me or the revenue department that gave a clean chit to IMA. Police submitted a report that the activities of the company did not attract action under provisions of the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments (KPID) Act and said there was no case against it. We only wanted to hear from the law department about the company as it was still under the RBI scanner. Did Khan meet you in person seeking help...?Khan met me last month. I cannot deny this fact. But I didn\u2019t do him any undue favour. Khan came to meet me with Baig. Baig said Khan was from his constituency and was of good character. I clearly told Baig that we would only do whatever we were allowed to do within the legal framework. But these developments give scope for doubt that the revenue department went out of its way to help the IMA Group...As I said earlier, the government did not do anything outside the legal framework. While the police department reported that the activities of IMA did not attract provisions of the KPID Act as it was not collecting deposits from the public, the RBI wanted to reinvestigate. I told my principal secretary Rajkumar Khatri to follow the laid-down procedure. He sent the file to the law department. There are allegations that pressure was exerted on officials...I am not one to hide anything. I hadn\u2019t even seen the file before Khatri sent it to the law department. It came to me only after the law department sent it back. I am so transparent that I invite you to see the file and learn about its movement from the revenue department to the law department and back to the revenue department. While I don\u2019t remember the exact details, the file came to me last month and the government is still pursuing the matter. With all this, how do you expect people to have faith in the government and hope to get justice?People can repose faith in the government as we are making sincere efforts to get the depositors justice. We are even looking into new legislation to ensure speedy disposal of cases involving Ponzi companies.

This comes a day after chief minister HD Kumaraswamy expanded his cabinet by inducting R Shankar and H Nagesh into the ministry, in an apparent move to give stability to his 13-month old wobbly JD(S)-Congress coalition government. The two Independent legislators were inducted into the ministry overlooking the claims of several senior leaders, particularly in the Congress, who are sulking ever since they failed to make it to the ministry earlier. Other than Siddaramaiah and top ministers, most of the Congress leaders and senior legislators such as HK Patil, BC Patil and Sudhakar who are ministerial aspirants, had skipped Friday's swearing-in ceremony, giving credence to reports of a growing discontent. Karnataka Congress chief Dinesh Gundu Rao told reporters here, \"Reshuffle will happen definitely... Most probably in about six to eight months the process of reshuffle will begin and many who have not got the opportunity, including several seniors, they will be taken into confidence.\" \"Evaluation of ministers' performance and representation will be looked into and decided (during the reshuffle),\" he said. Terming the induction of Independent MLAs into the state cabinet as \"most unfortunate,\" BC Patil, the Congress MLA from Hirekeru, said that he is discussing future move with other legislators and friends. Hitting out at the Congress state leadership, he said, \"It looks like saving the government is more important than saving the party. If the party survives there will be government.\" Pointing out that the Congress won only one seat in the recently concluded Lok Sabha polls, Patil said rather than legislators who worked for it, Independents who won against the party were being given berths. \"I'm unable to understand the logic behind it,\" he said, claiming that Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah and deputy chief minister G Parameshwara had given assurance that he would be made minister after the general elections. Noting that Patil might have spoken out of \"disappointment\", state agriculture minister NH Shivashankar Reddy too said a cabinet reshuffle was on the cards. \"It has already been decided that after some time, sitting ministers should make way for new faces, during which he (Patil) may be accommodated,\" he said. The cabinet expansion on Friday was seen as a move to ensuring that the two Independent lawmakers don't jump the ship once again and move to the BJP, affecting the stability of the government. Shankar was inducted from the Congress' share and Nagesh from the JD(S) quota in the ministry. Under the coalition arrangement, out of the total 34 ministerial positions, Congress and JD(S) have 22 and 12 berths respectively. Prior to the expansion, three posts were vacant-- two from JD(S) and one from Congress. There is still one post vacant in the JD(S) share. Faced with a rout in the Lok Sabha polls and growing disgruntlement within, the coalition leaders, after a series of negotiations, had decided to fill vacant posts in the cabinet. An increasing number of cabinet berth aspirants in the Congress is worrying the coalition leaders, as this may once again lead to disgruntlement and cause disturbance in the smooth functioning of the government. Meanwhile, dismissing reports about his resignation as state Congress chief, Rao said, he has not written any letter to the party high command as being reported, and his continuation as the party's state unit chief is left for the Congress leadership to decide. Rao was conspicuous by his absence at the cabinet expansion on Friday.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The owner of city-based IMA Jewels owner, Mohammed Mansoor Khan, had disappeared few days ago after allegedly threatening to commit suicide while police formed teams to trace him. State BJP chief B S Yedyurappa put forth the demand for a probe by the central agency after a group of people belonging to the minority community, most of them investors in IMA Jewels, met him and submitted a petition. Yeddyurappa assured them that BJP MPs from Karnataka would ensure the central governments intervention and steps to ensure the Enforcement Directorate probe into the case. \"We (BJP) feel that it is our responsibility to ensure that innocents who have lost their money get it back,\" Yeddyurappa was quoted as saying by BJP in a release. Only a CBI inquiry can ensure justice to the affected investors, he said, as he held the state government responsible for the \"injustice\" to the IMA investors. The BJP leader also promised those who met him that the Centre would take all steps to find out the wherebaouts of IMA jewels owner Mohammed Mansoor Khan. Earlier, speaking to reporters, Yeddyurappa raised questions about minority welfare minister B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan's alleged links with Mohammed Mansoor Khan. \"While asking him (Mansoor) to come back, Zameer, who is a minister, has said that government is with you (Mansoor), dont fear- what does this mean? chief minister has to answer this,\" he said. Hitting back at Yeddyurappa, Zameer Ahmed Khan pointed out that it was he who took initiative after the incident came to light and sought a SIT probe. \"It was not Yeddyurappa. Making speeches sitting somewhere is not enough. We are doing whatever we can. SIT is probing...,\" he said. Nearly 30,000 complaints have so far been received by police in connection with the case, relating to which seven directors of the firm were apprehended on June 12 . Mohammed Mansoor Khan went absconding after allegedly threatening to commit suicide in an audio clip. As the audio went viral, panicked investors, most of them Muslims, had swarmed the firm's office at Shivajinagar in thousands, demanding action against the owner and directors. Khan in an audio clip had purportedly said he was committing suicide as he was fed up with corruption. He had also alleged the Shivajinagar Congress MLA Roshan Baig took Rs 400 crore from him and was not returning the money. Baig had rubbished the charge, alleging that his political adversaries had orchestrated the \"series of events\" to tarnish his character. On June 12, The Karnataka government had formed a 11-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the case. As reports emerged that Khan had fled to Dubai, the SIT said they were investigating his whereabouts. The Enforcement Directorate also filed a case of money laundering in the alleged ponzi scheme. The agency's zonal office here filed an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), equivalent to an FIR, and has pressed criminal charges under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), officials had said.

The filings by IM Advisory Private Limited, as the company is registered with the ministry of corporate affairs, raise questions as to how it managed the money of tens of thousands of investors with such poor cash cushion.

Sources said Metro\u2019s Gottigere-Nagawara, RV Road-Bommasandra, Silk Board-KR Puram and KR Puram- Kempegowda International Airport lines are likely to be delayed if GAIL Gas and Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) don\u2019t resolve the issues. On Gottigere-Nagawara corridor, for instance, GAIL Gas\u2019s eight-inch steel pipeline is close to the proposed underground Pottery Town Metro station. BMRCL along with GAIL Gas recently conducted a joint site visit at Pottery Town. GAIL Gas has now agreed to shift the pipeline about 200m away. At Silk Board junction, where an interchange station of RV Road-Bommasandra and Silk Board-KR Puram lines is planned, about 200 metres of steel pipeline has to be relocated. Separately, GAIL Gas has asked BMRCL to realign 700 metres of Metro line of the Silk Board-Agara Lake stretch on Outer Ring Road to avoid shifting of GAIL Gas\u2019s pipeline, which is now under the discussion stage. Sources said BMRCL is unlikely to change the alignment as it may have to acquire additional properties. However, at some locations, GAIL Gas has already realigned its proposed pipeline during execution stage based on the modifications suggested by BMRCL. In fact, GAIL Gas shifted 2km of an eight-inch gas pipeline from Jayadeva Hospital-Sony World signal to accommodate Metro alignment. Further, about 1.3km of pipeline was rerouted in Yelahanka as per BMRCL recommendations. On ITPL Main Road, GAIL Gas officials said they shifted operational MDPE network carrying natural gas in two places and relocation of operational steel network is in progress at two other locations. \u201cOn the same ITPL Road the steel network (uncharged) was shifted at two locations in the construction phase itself,\u201d said a GAIL Gas official. \u201cWhen natural gas pipelines are laid by open trench method, the depth is 1-2 metres from ground level and may vary depending on the presence of other utilities like drains, water pipelines and electric cables. When pipelines are laid by trenchless (HDD method), the depth varies from 2 to 8m,\u201d said a GAIL Gas spokesperson. Asked if it\u2019s possible to relocate pipelines, an official said: \u201cGAIL Gas is laying steel & MDPE pipeline networks. So, shifting of charged gas pipelines is the last option as gas supply to customers will be affected. There are also safety concerns. The relocation of steel network can be taken up only when there is no other alternative.\u201d \u201cWe are coordinating to resolve issues related to natural gas pipelines and Metro work. We\u2019ll soon resolve these issues to meet the Phase 2 deadline. We\u2019re also conducting a joint survey with GAIL Gas for new Metro lines so that necessary modifications can be implemented during the design stage itself,\u201d said a BMRCL official. LESSONS FROM PAST DAMAGE GAIL officials said two instances of damages to gas pipelines due to Metro work have been reported on ITPL Road. Sources said after the damage to a gas pipeline on ITPL Road in October 2018, a coordination meeting was held between GAIL and BMRCL officials to discuss ways to avoid such incidents. Both agencies decided to share alignment details of the proposed and ongoing work and map the utilities along Metro alignment and take precautionary measure. All Metro work was suspended for a week and joint site visits were conducted to identify vulnerable areas. BMRCL resumed work post joint site visit. BMRCL had changed Namma Metro route to KIA via Hebbal after the line proposed earlier \u2014 which runs via Ramakrishna Hegde Nagar, Nagawara and Jakkur \u2014 was too close to Bengaluru-Mangaluru Oil pipeline. All Saints\u2019 Church protests against BMRCL Residents, activists and members of All Saints' Church protested for the fourth time, inside the All Saints' Church in Ashoknagar against the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) which is acquiring the church\u2019s 4,500sqm of land for Metro work. Activists claimed the project is against the BMRCL\u2019s DPR (detailed project planning). \u201cOver 150 trees belonging to 13 different species will have to be cut for the construction,\u201d said Jiben Vijaya of All Saints'. The protesters want the proposed Metro station at the spot needs to be moved 25 metres to the left to avoid damage to the environment. TIMES VIEW There\u2019s no end in sight to the woes of Namma Metro. The latest is the possible clash of GAIL pipelines with the Metro sections of upcoming lines. It\u2019s time these companies sat down to resolve the issue at the earliest. There have been too many delays in Metro construction and this has resulted in massive cost escalation. The huge popularity of the two Metro lines among commuters is an indicator of how badly the city needs this mass transport system. We need more lines and better connectivity to all areas so that people can move seamlessly across the city.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

The civic agency has failed to keep its side of the bargain and provide its project partners decent school buildings and spruce up classrooms by freshly painting them. TimesViewIt envisioned lighting up the lives of thousands of students by bringing them on a par with their private school counterparts in terms of exposure and facilities. However, Project Roshni is far from fulfilling its objectives, thanks to the indolence of civic authorities. The poll code may have been a hindrance but the excuse doesn't pass muster as the agency had ample time to spruce up classrooms since September when the scheme was officially launched. Nevertheless, with the code having been lifted, the Palike should do the needful so that its project partners can give schools a much-needed smart makeover.The Rs 500-crore project, which was to take off this academic year, had envisaged bringing digital TVs, tablets, augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and machine learning into BBMP classrooms, apart from enhancing teachers\u2019 skills and encouraging community involvement. Mostly funded by Microsoft, which had announced it would share its software free of cost with students of BBMP schools and colleges, the project will now have to wait for another year to see the light of day.

And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added.

Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

A proper kitchen served hot meals and rounds of tea and coffee to leaders at the back end of the protest tent. The food, prepared by a private catering service, was supplied on plantain leaves. A separate tent with air coolers was erected so party members could take a break from the stir and rest. There were portable toilets for BJP workers; most leaders used the facilities at the nearby Hotel Maurya.

Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital.

Dinakaran, 28, and Dharmendra, 28, natives of Tamil Nadu\u2019s Vellore district and residents of Kudlu Gate here, had stolen at least 48 batteries worth Rs 7.5 lakh. Police, who have recovered the batteries, said all these months, the duo had only targeted towers installed by private telecom operators who seldom complained, and therefore, they never come under police radar. They didn\u2019t target government towers as Dinakaran knew that the theft would be reported mandatorily. They were arrested on Friday after they stole batteries from a BSNL tower in Tatanagar near Kodigehalli assuming that it was installed by a private player. BSNL field manager Rajiv M, who had noticed on April 26 that the batteries he had seen the previous day were missing, filed a complaint. Handiwork of jobless MBA graduate Dinakaran, a MBA graduate who worked with a reputed MNC in the city, quit his job to join to a mobile tower installation and maintenance company couple of years ago. However, he left the firm an year ago. Police suspect he had been stealing from the time he quit the job. Dinakaran, disguised as a mobile tower installation company representative, stole batteries along with Dharmendra. They scouted the city for suitable mobile towers, and once they identified one, they executed their plan posing as professionals. They would hire a goods autorickshaw and transport the batteries. \u201cNobody suspected the accused as they assumed them to be from the company,\u201d police said, adding that a battery worth Rs 12,000 to Rs 15,000 would be sold for as little as Rs 4,000 or Rs 6,000. Police, after identifying the duo from CCTV footages, arrested them. They said Dinakar\u2019s wife, who works with an MNC as HR manager, was in the dark about this. \u201cEvery time he brought home batteries, she thought they\u2019re related to his work. After he quit his job, he earned money from theft. While he gave some to his wife, he spent the rest on his vices,\u201d cops added.

This entity is the one that accepted capital contribution from partners (depositors). All partners bear both the risk and reward. The entity hasn't maintained a ledger of partner details after the first year of incorporation, show RoC filings. IMAIP Bullion and Trading LLP was incorporated on June 10, 2015. In 2015-16, the company had 184 partners with total \"contributions\" received from these partners amounting to Rs 4.9 crore. In less than three years, the contributions/ investments from partners overall swelled to over Rs 1,500 crore, based on over 30,000 complaints received from aggrieved partners of the scheme. In an LLP, only designated partners are authorised to transact on behalf of all.  The LLP created a partner bond, a risk-bearing instrument where the partners bear the full risk. The partners authorised IMAIP Bullion and Trading to invest in bullion and commodities on behalf of the partners. Deal doesn\u2019t talk about repaymentThis is a pure investment agreement for business where the risk and rewards is entirely on the partner. The agreement doesn\u2019t talk about any repayment of capital,\u201d said KR Girish, founder of tax advisory firm KR Girish & Associates.
