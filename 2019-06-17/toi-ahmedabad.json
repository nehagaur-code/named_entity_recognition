You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Jayanta Sarkar, director, IMD-Gujarat, said, \u201cThe system is likely to gradually weaken as it moves nearly Westwards over the next 24-36 hours. However, after 36 hours, it is likely to curve back towards the north-easterly direction. It is possible that it will reach coastal Saurashtra and Kutch as a deep depression on the evening of June 17 (Monday).\u201d \u201cSince it will cross the Gujarat coast as a deep depression, heavy rainfall is expected in the Kutch and adjoining Saurashtra-Kutch coast. The wind speed is expected to remain at 45-55km per hour. However, no damage is expected due to this wind speed,\u201d Sarkar explained. According to the IMD forecast, the system is likely to move towards North Gujarat by June 18, which will also trigger rainfall in the region. \u201cThis will give rainfall to three districts of North Gujarat \u2013 Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Patan.\u201d As a result of the cyclone, fairly widespread rainfall was experienced over the Saurashtra region. Southerly winds due to the cyclone also brought in a lot of moisture as a result of which, Ahmedabad also received good rainfall.  \u201cLight to moderate rain or thundershowers are very likely at isolated places in the districts of Gujarat region namely Ahmedabad, Valsad, Navsari, and Daman, Dadra Nagar Haveli and in the districts of Saurashtra-Kutch, namely Devbhumi Dwarka, Porbandar, Junagadh, Gir-Somanath, Kutch and in Diu,\u201d according to the forecast.

Increasing incidents of crocodile attacks and straying into human settlements have forced the forest department to \u2018detain\u2019 them in Pavagadh and scout for tourism potential as well. According to chief conservator of forests (CCF), Vadodara division, S K Shrivastav, it has been decided that stray reptiles will now be bundled off to a unique \u2018Kala Pani\u2019 carved out of an abandoned quarry of blacktrap in the Dhobi Ghat area. \u201cIt will be spread over one hectare. The place is 54km from Vadodara city,\u201d he said. The step may bring respite to those in Vadodara city and villages along the Charotar belt who usually see these reptiles lurking in water bodies in their vicinity. Today, there are close to 250 crocodiles in Charotar belt and 300 in Vadodara city. The work on creating the unique habitat has already begun and it will be ready in two months. \u201cThe area will house more than 100 crocodiles,\u201d said Shrivastav. \u201cThe forest department usually releases the rescued crocodiles. Now, they will be released in this zone. There are 37 such abandoned mines that can be exploited for similar purposes,\u201d said deputy conservator of forests Anshuman Sharma. What has prompted the move is the gradual increase in incidents of human-reptile conflicts. In Vadodara, citizens may have made peace with these jawed reptiles, but Vishwamitri river has witnessed crocodile attacks at Sama lake and Asoj lake where five lives were lost in 2014. In 2017, two injuries were reported in Vishwamitri river, while in the following year, three injuries were recorded there. \u201cPeople in the Charotar belt have learnt to live with crocodiles, which is not the case in Vadodara city,\u201d said former Wildlife Institute of India (WII) member B C Choudhry. The growing attacks are also being reasoned to the growing number of crocodile population. These reptiles are highly territorial, making them more prone to attacks. The 2015 census had revealed presence of over 260 crocodiles in the 25km stretch of Vishwamitri river that passes through the heart of Vadodara. In the Anand-Charotar belt, 58 crocodiles were sighted at Deva village in Anand district. After Deva, the maximum number of crocodiles (38) were sighted in the two water bodies of Heranj, followed by 28 and 25 in Traj and Dabhou villages.

The state government, however, cited legalities and constitutional propriety, which prevent such meetings from being held under public glare. The doctors were ready to accept the government's request, sources indicated late Sunday, which would pave the way for \"across-the-table\" discussions between the protesters and the chief minister. \"We are very hopeful for the meeting in Nabanna (state secretariat) on Monday,\" a senior official, mediating for the state, said. \"We have explained to them that given the issues involved, mainly legal, administrative and security-related, it is impossible for the state government to agree to their demand for an open-door meeting in presence of the media.

The meeting appeared to split three ways. While a section of doctors agreed to have the meeting at Nabanna, another section stressed on Raj Bhavan as the venue, while the remaining stuck to their demand for NRS Hospital. Pressure further mounted on the striking doctors to find a solution to the standoff. At 3.30pm, a group of doctors announced their stand. \"We are hopeful that our CM will be considerate enough to solve the problems that the state is facing in the healthcare sector currently,\" they said in a statement while refusing to accept any question from the media. \"We leave the decision to choose the venue to the honourable CM, but it should accommodate representatives of all medical colleges of West Bengal in sufficient numbers,\" the statement read.

The storm would take form of depression or deep depression when it would land on Kutch coast around June 17 midnight and bring rain to Kutch-Saurashtra region, mentioned forecast by India Meteorological Department (IMD). The Met department officials mentioned that while there would be strong wind, there are slim chances of any damage due to the phenomenon. As on Sunday evening, the storm lied 450km west-southwest of Dwarka coast. The storm is inching towards Gujarat at a steady speed. Jayanta Sarkar, regional director, IMD, told TOI that the system is very likely to weaken gradually to a cyclonic storm over next 12 hours and later into a deep depression during subsequent 12 hours. \u201cThe system is very likely to move northwards and then northeastwards, crossing Kutch coast by June 17 midnight as depression. We have issued heavy rainfall warning for Kutch and Saurashtra districts. The wind speed would be around 45-50kmph but it is not likely to cause major damage,\u201d he said. IMD has issued warning for heavy rains in isolated places in Porbandar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar, Morbi and Kutch. Sarkar added that on June 18, the system would further move north-northeastwards and cover northern districts of the state, bringing heavy rain to Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Patan, Mehsana, Aravalli, Kutch and Morbi. \u201cAhmedabad and Gandhinagar are also likely to get rain,\u201d he said. According to IMD forecast, almost all north Gujarat districts are likely to get rain over next three days due to the impact of the weather system. The very severe cyclonic storm, formed in Arabian Sea, was likely to make a landfall near Veraval-Diu on June 13. The storm later changed course and went away from the state, preventing loss of lives and property. The state government had already evacuated close to 2 lakh people from coastal regions and had warned the fishermen to stay away from the sea and coast.

While heavy rain has replenished water bodies across seven districts of the region, farmers have also used the spell of rain to expedite sowing of kharif crops.  With the Met department forecasting widespread rainfall in Kutch, Saurashtra and North Gujarat on Monday and Tuesday as a result of the deep depression in the Arabian Sea, sowing in parts of North Gujarat and Saurashtra is expected to receive a further impetus. Karsan Odedara, who stays in Kodinar taukar of Gir-Somnath district, has already completed groundnut sowing on two bighas of land. \u201cI had sowed a summer crop, but harvested it when news of the cyclone first spread. I ploughed and watered the field immediately and completed groundnut sowing. \u201cSprouting of the seeds will take place in five or six days and I will also get the earlybird price advantage, as my crop will be one of the earliest to be harvested,\u201d he said. Kiran Patel, a farmer of Chhiti village of Keshod taluka of Junagadh district says he did not sow any summer crops because of shortage of water. \u201cWhen there were adequate indications of rainfall, I ploughed the field and kept it ready. Now that my field has received one good spell of rain, I will sow cotton over the two hectares of land that I have already ploughed,\u201d he said. On Friday, 17 talukas of six districts \u2013 Junagadh, Rajkot, Gir-Somnath, Porbandar, Jamnagar and Amreli \u2013 received between 2mm and 104mm rainfall even as the effects of cyclone Vayu began to diminish. Rains lashed several parts of coastal Saurashtra on Thursday as well. A top official of the state agriculture department said, \u201cFeedback from district agriculture officers suggests that the spell of rain will be useful for farmers in Bhavnagar, Gir-Somnath, Porbandar and Junagadh districts. The rain received in these districts is conducive for sowing. One or two days of bright sunshine will create favourable conditions for groundnut and cotton sowing. Hopefully, monsoon should arrive by the month end.\u201d Retired bureaucrat and agriculture expert Abhay Raval says although the rainfall is not spread across Saurashtra and has been confined only to coastal areas, it is an encouraging indicator of increased sowing of kharif crops. \u201cA couple of rivers have also experienced floods, which means several check dams also will be full. The presence of adequate moisture in the soil will encourage sowing and possibly sustain saplings until the next round of monsoon activity,\u201d he said. Raval added that while monsoon normally hits Gujarat only after the first fortnight of June, rainfall in most parts of coastal Saurashtra before June 15 will definitely increase kharif sowing. Although kharif crop sowing will continue until August, state agriculture department figures show reasonable sowing that has already happened. With the spell of rainfall, sowing figures will further increase, experts feel.

Her notoreity emerges from the narrow serpentine lanes of Manilal Mathurdas ni Chali, Margafarm road in a densely populated locality of Bapunagar. The place is marked by men who are quick to spot unfamiliar faces and confront them. These burly men work for Sitara. Many locals say that Sitara has earned the moniker of \u2018Lady Latif\u2019. In fact, Sitara recently kicked her way into the public imagination when her video of mercilessly kicking and thrashing a man went viral some days ago. The man was her aide Danish Khan whom she suspected of having siphoned away Rs 28,000. Locals say that Sitara had herself shot the video and put it on social media to send out a message of branding herself as a no-nonsense, don\u2019t-mess-with-me woman bootlegger in a largely male dominated illicit profession. Deputy commissioner of police, zone five, Akshay Raj Makwana said Sitara was arrested for the video and later released on bail. \u201cShe is feared by the locals with some even migrated from the area. Sitara is alleged to have close nexus with few cops and it is not surprising then that some locals who dared to confront her are facing frivolous FIRs,\u201d said social worker Kalim Siddique. \u201cWe are writing to the court to cancel her bails as she has been a notorious offender and continues with the illicit trade despite giving assurances to the court. We want to set an example for other bootleggers not to violate bail condition,\u201d says Makwana. Sitara has at least half a dozen cases registered against her which includes bootlegging, assault and threatening. So, who is this woman giving sleepless nights to cops? The mother of a 5-year-old child, Sitara\u2019s brushes with law began three years ago when she was 22 year old. She used to visit the local police station regularly because of her five brothers. Her brothers used to get arrested regularly or called for questioning whenever there was a theft of scrap at old mill compounds. At that time, it was a police constable in Bapunagar station who brought her into the illicit trade. \u201cThe constable loaned her Rs 3 lakh to begin her own bootlegging business. She began with trafficking 10 to 15 liquor bottles every day,\u201d says a social worker in Bapunagar. \u201cHe cultivated Sitara into bootlegging as back then it was a safer bet to have a woman carrier of illegal liquor,\u201d said the social worker. Locals say that Sitara is the daughter of a tea-stall owner Abdul Karim. Her father married twice, left the seven children and Sitara\u2019s mother Shahida for another woman in UP .

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

The eight schemes offered cover education, foreign education, food bills, tuition assistance, coaching assistance, training for competitive exams, self employment and interest assistance for professionals.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership.

The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Suvarna Chavan, 22, was thrown out by her in-laws months after her marriage when her kidneys failed. The in-laws said she deserved to be dumped on the road. Suvarna\u2019s father Sriram Chavan, a truck driver who has studied only up to class X, stepped up and with actions steeped in love and desperation showed the courage and selflessness that \u2018beti bachao\u2019 missions require.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The Congress party is crying foul, alleging that the BJP is misusing constitutional institutions. The BJP has shot back saying that the Congress has made it a habit to blame institutions for its inability to win elections.  At the heart of the controversy is the contentious issue of whether the election for the two Rajya Sabha seats should be held simultaneously or separately. If the election is held simultaneously, the BJP does not have the numbers in the assembly to win both seats. If held separately, the BJP is comfortably placed to get both candidates elected. The two seats fell vacant after Amit Shah and Smriti Irani won their respective seats in the Lok Sabha election held recently. As far as the ECI is concerned, it has relied on sections 147 to 151 of the Representation of the People Act to issue separate notifications for the two seats. The ECI has construed the election to the two seats to be bypolls instead of end-of-term polls, citing an order of the Delhi high court, which upheld the conduct of separate elections for seats. Rajya Sabha seats are crucial for both political parties, especially during voting on important bills. The Congress fought hard and even had to airlift its MLAs out of Gujarat to Karnataka in 2017 in its successful bid to get Ahmed Patel elected to the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat. The ECI has announced the schedule for the Rajya Sabha bypoll for six seats, including for two vacant seats of Gujarat.

According to the figures from FADA, 1.11 lakh vehicles were registered in Gujarat in May 2019, against 1.35 lakh vehicles in May 2018. Experts attributed the slide to weak demand based on weakening consumer sentiment coupled with liquidity issues. Registration of two-wheelers has been hit particularly hard. The data suggests that against registration of two-wheelers in Gujarat declined by 19%, going from 1.10 lakh in May 2018 to 89,504 in May 2019. Passenger car registrations declined by 12.7% in May, with 21,929 registered in May 2019 against 25,127 in May 2018. Pranav Shah, director of the Gujarat chapter of FADA, said, \u201cOverall consumer sentiment is weak, as people are not making purchases readily. There is a liquidity crunch in the market which is preventing people from making purchases. Initially, we thought that sales are poor as people are holding their purchases due to the election results, however, even after the results were in line with market expectations, sales have failed to improve.\u201d Automobile dealers also said that the number of customers buying vehicles through financing options has also risen. \u201cFor four wheelers, some 90% of consumers are buying vehicles through financing options. The ratio of people buying two-wheelers through finance options has risen significantly, from 45% to 60%, over the last few months,\u201d said a city-based dealer, on condition of anonymity. Industry stakeholders also said that the automobile market has failed to revive since August 2018, despite festivals like Navratri, Dussehra, Dhanteras and the recent Akshaya Tritiya in May, which are all considered auspicious for vehicle purchases.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli. In Video:No Murli Manohar Joshi in BJP list of 43Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}}
