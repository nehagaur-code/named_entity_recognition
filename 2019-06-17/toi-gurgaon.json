According to officials of GMDA\u2019s engineering wing, the surveys will either be conducted annually or biennially. Roughness index is a measure of texture of a road surface. It tests the number of potholes or craters per kilometre. This survey will be done on all master roads under GMDA\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201cRoughness index of a road will help us understand its current condition and the frequency of repair required,\u201d said a GMDA official. He added that if the number of craters on a stretch exceeds permissible limit, they will need immediate repair. Peak volume capacity will be used to understand if traffic at a particular junction is within its capacity or beyond. In case a junction witnesses more traffic than its capacity, it would cause traffic jams, requiring both short- and long- term solutions. \u201cIn such a case, we\u2019ll either need to widen roads or build an underpass/flyover, depending on need,\u201d said the official. As of now, flyovers/underpasses are developed based on traffic reports, without any prior survey. Finally, road safety audit (RSA) will help GMDA identify accident-prone zones in the city. Once complete, the authority can use the audit to identify the need for speedbreakers and signboards, as required. In addition, the mobility plan will also help GMDA understand the need for new projects, such as underpasses and flyovers. The plan is currently under process and is expected to be out in the next few months. \u201cWith the help of these surveys, we can identify \u2018black spots\u2019 and make necessary arrangements as per Indian Road Congress rules, to bring down number of accidents,\u201d said the official.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Colonies like Noble Farms, Sadhguru Farms and parts of Ashok Vihar and Dharam colony, which fall within the 300m restricted area, are the worst hit. Though the Punjab and Haryana high court has given its nod for temporary power and water connections to residents of the area until the legality of the colonies is decided, residents here still depend on water tankers and groundwater. While they have demanded that the MCG provide them with water supply, the corporation maintains that connections can't be given as the matter is sub-judice. Residents claimed that in spite of filing petitions in the court to seek temporary services like power and water supply until the final orders on the structures raised in the area are dispensed, their pleas have fell on deaf ears. While their collective efforts did help them avail temporary power connections, water supply remains a distant luxury for many, they said. In the absence of proper supply, residents are either relying on private water tankers or submersible pumps to draw groundwater. The overuse of such pumps has contributed to the deteriorating groundwater situation in the city. According to the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA), Gurugram is overdrawing its groundwater supply by 300%. As a result, the water table had fallen by 33m in 2014, and the table is receding by 1m every year. Commenting on the existing water supply situation in the area, an MCG official said, \u201cWe can\u2019t provide water to households within 300m of the IAF depot as the matter is in court and the structures here have been deemed illegal.\u201d The official further noted that the department has laid down water pipelines in certain pockets that are over and above the 300m range, and the remaining work will completed in coming few months. Removing structures from the area has become one of the biggest infrastructural challenges of the district administration. The legitimacy of the houses and shops within 900m of the depot has been contested in court for years. In 2015, the Centre had told the high court that the restricted zone around the depot had been decreased from 900m to 300m. The court had further asked the district administration to ensure that no new structure is raised in the area. However, residents have claimed that several paying guest accommodations, shops and residential structures have come up in the area even after court orders. Meanwhile, MCG officials have claimed that their demolition drives have faced severe resistance from the inhabitants.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Police commissioner Muhamad Akil said one of the accused had once saw Taneja \u2014 lone breadwinner of the family, counting cash at his shop. \u201cPresuming that the trader keeps a lot of cash in the shop, the accused contacted another criminal, and the duo later roped in one more criminal from UP to execute the crime,\u201d said Akil. Akil said it was surprising that they conducted the recce for so long and remained unnoticed. \u201cIt took a lot of effort by the police team to identify and track the accused.

They identified the accused on the scooter and matched him with the criminal records. The person on the scooter turned out to be Suraj Katari from Basai, a history-sheeter, against whom more than six cases of loot, robbery and snatching are registered at different police stations of Gurugram. Kataria had come out of jail in January. A team led by Varun Dahiya, in-charge of the crime unit of Sector 39 on Saturday managed to arrest Suraj Kataria from Bahadurgarh bus stand. Kataria was hiding in Bahadurgarh. Kataria divulged the names of his two associates, which led cops to other two accused. Manoj, a resident of Kumhar mohalla, was arrested from Mata Mandir while Suraj, a resident of Hathras in UP, was nabbed from Jyoti Park in Gurugram. All three arrests were made on Saturday. According to police, after coming out of the jail in January, Kataria met his old friend Manoj alias Munna and decided to execute some big crimes to make quick bucks. Manoj told him about garment shop owner Taneja, saying he is making lots of money and every day he carries cash after closing the shop at night. They then decided to rope in Suraj to understand the daily routine of Taneja. They conducted recce for one month before executing the crime. \u201cThey had engaged Suraj to conduct the recce with an objective to remain unidentified by shopkeepers,\u201d said the police chief. On May 28, Taneja was going home on his scooty after closing his shop when he was shot dead. The assailants, who were on a bike, fled with his scooty and the cash bag.

He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said.

Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

In some areas, power cuts continued till Thursday morning, said Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) officials. A large number oftrees were uprooted in the storm. Electricity poles in Palam Vihar, Sushant Lok, South City 1, DLF 3, sectors 23, 30 and 46, and other areas were damaged beyond repairs, the officials added. Many residents had to spend the night in the dark. Though many of them called the discom, enquiring about the power situation, they claimed they got no clear response. \u201cAround 300 families in Sector 23A had to suffer without power after a pole fell because of storm. DHBVN failed to restore power or provide an alternative solution,\u201d said Bhawani Shankar Tripathy, general secretary, RWA, Sector 23A. Similarly, in Sushant Lok 1, residents spent the night trying to remove trees from roads with the hope of getting power back. \u201cA car parked under a tree was crushed after a huge peepul tree collapsed on it in the storm. The branches also overhead disrupted power supply lines, leaving the area blacked out for over 20 hours,\u201d said Sushant Lok resident Bhawana Singh. The electricity department took more than 20 hours to remove the tree from the area, after which they initiated restoration work, residents said. Residents of high-rise societies also had a tough time. Suraj Wadhwa, who lives in Sector 61, said, \u201cLife in a high-rise is miserable without electricity. We didn\u2019t have power backup because there was some issue with the generator sets in the society.\u201d Even discom officials had a tough time, as they spent the night attending calls and fixing lines. \u201cOur complaint number was flooded with calls on Wednesday evening after the storm. We got over 1,000 calls from across the city. Our officials worked the whole night till Thursday morning to restore power,\u201d said K C Aggarwal, superintendent engineer, DHBVN.

However, in a move that may bring some relief to patients in New Delhi, AIIMS resident doctors have decided not to join the strike. But those in Safdarjung Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College, RML Hospital and others will skip work. In Kolkata on Sunday, the agitating doctors said they were ready to meet Mamata Banerjee \"anytime and anywhere\". The government proposed a 3pm meeting at the state secretariat on Monday. The doctors were reportedly ready to accept the proposal. IMA strike to cripple OPDs todayEarlier, the junior doctors had insisted that the meeting cannot be held behind closed doors and the media should be allowed to telecast it live. The state government, however, cited legalities and constitutional propriety, which prevent such meetings from being held under public glare. The doctors were ready to accept the government's request, sources indicated late Sunday, which would pave the way for \"across-the-table\" discussions between the protesters and the chief minister. \"We are very hopeful for the meeting in Nabanna (state secretariat) on Monday,\" a senior official, mediating for the state, said. \"We have explained to them that given the issues involved, mainly legal, administrative and security-related, it is impossible for the state government to agree to their demand for an open-door meeting in presence of the media. The CM is also sworn to an oath of secrecy in some such matters. We have explained they have every right to speak to media afterwards, much like the norm in all such cases. They have agreed to it,\" he said. Under pressure from several quarters, including the seniors in the medical fraternity, the junior doctors in Kolkata held a four-hour general body meeting at NRS Hospital. The meeting appeared to split three ways. While a section of doctors agreed to have the meeting at Nabanna, another section stressed on Raj Bhavan as the venue, while the remaining stuck to their demand for NRS Hospital. Pressure further mounted on the striking doctors to find a solution to the standoff. At 3.30pm, a group of doctors announced their stand. \"We are hopeful that our CM will be considerate enough to solve the problems that the state is facing in the healthcare sector currently,\" they said in a statement while refusing to accept any question from the media. \"We leave the decision to choose the venue to the honourable CM, but it should accommodate representatives of all medical colleges of West Bengal in sufficient numbers,\" the statement read. They expressed willingness to join work, \"as early as possible in the best interest of the common people once our demands are addressed\".

The OPDs in the Civil Hospital and private hospitals, however, were not shut. Moreover, the Gurugram chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) will follow the call of IMA headquarters, which has announced 24 hours withdrawal of non-essential services from 6am on Monday to 6am on Tuesday. \u201cThese incidents of violence against doctors have grown tremendously, and there has been no action taken to save the medical fraternity. The IMA had called for a nationwide protest on Friday. This included wearing black ribbons and arm bands while working in hospitals and clinics to make the patients and public aware of the situation. Now that IMA has called a strike on Monday, we are going to follow it,\u201d said Dr Ajay Gupta, secretary, IMA, Gurugram. Principal medical officer Dr Deepa Jakhar said Haryana\u2019s health department had called for the protest on Saturday, but since there is a NQAS quality survey going on, the hospital could not shut its OPD services. However, doctors were seen wearing black ribbons. \u201cWe condemn the shameful attack on doctors in West Bengal. Violence against doctors is not something new and we have been holding protests against such attacks. However, everyone has failed to protect doctors,\u201d said Dr Jai Bhagwan Jatain, medical superintendent, Civil Hospital, Gurugram. The OPDs in the government and private hospitals had the usual rush of patients and the doctors were attending them. However, there is still an uncertainty over whether the private hospitals will join the protest call given by the IMA on Monday. \u201cThe doctors\u2019 strike in Kolkata and the solidarity shown in Delhi, Hyderabad and other cities indicate that it is a widespread problem that needs to be addressed through a series of systemic changes.,\u201d said Dharminder Nagar, MD, Paras Healthcare.

However, unlike the IPL, which sees the games telecast in the evenings, the World Cup\u2019s schedule isn\u2019t that considerate for working professionals. The 3pm start time for most matches means that the first innings of every game will coincide with the regular working hours of most corporates. It\u2019s worse for those in the Millennium City who work for overseas clients from Europe. For these unfortunate souls, they begin their day in the afternoon anyway. \u201cI begin my day around 1pm and then work till 8-9pm, which coincides with the timing for the games,\u201d says 29-year-old self-professed \u2018cricket fanatic\u2019 Kshitij, who works for a consultancy in Udyog Vihar and is currently working with Dutch clients. Fortunately, Vidit\u2019s workplace has come to his rescue. His firm is among the many in Gurgaon that are screening some important games of the World Cup (particularly the ones featuring the Indian team) in the office premises. While on paper, the reason is that the companies want to \u2018boost employee morale\u2019 and \u2018celebrate the cricket World Cup\u2019, the reality is a bit different. As the World Cup matches start at 3pm, most professionals are in office at that hour. So many workplaces are screening the games in their premises\u2018In the last WC, our absentees would double or triple on the days when India played\u2019Managers and senior executives from several companies in the city tell us that the real reason behind the screenings of World Cup games in office is to ensure that employees do not bunk and work does not suffer. Reena Kulkarni, a senior executive with an IT firm in Udyog Vihar, says, \u201cThe decision to hold screenings of matches during the World Cup is as much an effort to create a fun atmosphere as it is to ensure that people at least come to the office, especially on the days when India plays. In the last World Cup, our absentees would double or triple on the days when India played. We figured if they want to watch the match, they can do that in office. The games begin at 3pm and most people might want to finish work by then and then chill with colleagues and watch the matches.\u201d Even in places where attendance is not an issue, managers agree that having screenings in office will reduce distracted employees. Asif Mohammed, Chief Technology Officer, Momspresso, says, \u201cWe do not generally see a dip in number of people attending office during the World Cup or increase in work-from-home requests but definitely employees are distracted and always checking the progress during the games. The conversations in office during the matches are also centred a lot on the same. We ensure that there is a lively atmosphere maintained and people can catch the game at office. This definitely adds to the energy in the office and helps build camaraderie in the team as well.\u201d And while the idea of screening a cricket match in the office might not seem like the best idea to increase productivity, companies say it works. \u201cIt might not be the ideal work environment but we can get some work done. We screened a few afternoon IPL games on the odd Saturdays we had working this season and even though half of us were in a festive mood, we managed to wrap up work. In fact, when employees are enjoying and having fun, they try and finish work quicker,\u201d says Jitesh, an HR executive with an ad firm that is screening almost all World Cup games this year. \u2018We felt it was better to have the game screened at office\u2019Most companies seem to have taken a lesson from the previous Cricket World Cup in 2015, which led to a decline in attendance whenever India played. Navodit Sen, a senior manager with a consultancy firm in Cyber City that will screen all of India\u2019s matches, tells us, \u201cMost of the games in this World Cup begin in the afternoon and we didn\u2019t want a repeat of the previous World Cup when much of the office was deserted during India\u2019s games. People would request work from home or suspiciously fall ill together. It was a big headache to handle.\u201d This time, the format of the tournament means India plays at least nine games over the next month. While India\u2019s biggest fixtures in the tournament \u2013 the games against Pakistan, Australia, and England \u2013 are on Sundays, the team plays all of its other matches on working days. And if companies aren\u2019t worried about employees bunking, they are worried that employees tend to get distracted. Mansoor Khan, whose consultancy on Sohna Road plans to screen all of India's games, explains, \u201cAlmost half of India\u2019s games in this World Cup are during weekdays. Two others are on Saturdays which are also working days for us. That means, it\u2019s seven days when almost the entire office would be more focussed on following the game instead of focussing on work. We figured it was better to have the game play on a giant screen in the office. That way, whoever is interested can follow the game and they don\u2019t have to sneak around to do that.

GMDA has developed a map exclusively for Gurugram, called OneMap Gurugram. Described as a GIS-integrated support system, OneMap is not just a navigation application, but also a data mine, with information from 35 government departments collated, digitised and accessible at a single point. The service is inspired by OneMap Singapore and can be accessed at https://onemapggm.gmda.gov.in. According to GMDA officials, the main objective of OneMap is more detailed and accurate geo-enabled Decision Support Systems, aligned with objectives of development of the state that increases effectiveness of land acquisition, planning, compensation, providing urban services, etc. Sultan Singh, head at GIS Lab, told TOI they have sourced information from multiple departments and brought it together in one place, so that the map can become the starting point for all of Gurugram\u2019s digital and Smart City applications. Singh and his team of 65 started work on OneMap in August 2017. After almost two years, the map is live with a huge amount of data available at a single click. The data is distributed under various heads, including wet and dry infrastructure, health, homeland security, planning, land governance, power and a citizen\u2019s portal. Using the citizen\u2019s portal, residents can search for an ATM, bank, government office and other such amenities. As of now, there are 12 live applications on OneMap, which will soon be available on a mobile phone app. While many applications are live, mapping of many utilities and infrastructures is still under way. One application already live on OneMap is land governance, which has land ownership records of private and government lands covering the whole of Gurugram Metropolitan Area. Talking about the scope of this application, Singh said, \u201cConsider an investor looking for land in the metropolitan area. He can use this app to see upcoming government projects such as SEZs, and then look for land parcels in its vicinity. Once he finds a suitable plot, he can then use the application to access details of its owners. We\u2019re certain this application will give a big boost to ease of doing business in the region,\u201d said Singh. Internally, OneMap is expected to aid government departments, which can access information from other departments and collaborate on projects. For instance, the health application is currently being used to identify areas with a higher concentration of vector-borne diseases. The information is then shared with the health department and MCG for preventive and corrective measures, such as fogging and larvicidal activities. OneMap is also expected to be very useful for civic projects, as it provides details of all utilities such as power, water and gas lines. \u201cThe system lets us know of the current status of underground utilities, which will help us take better decisions while designing roads and carrying out development projects,\u201d said a senior GMDA engineering official. While the engineering wing is in charge of roads, water bodies are the environment wing\u2019s responsibility. The OneMap website has information of all government departments, which is updated real time. \u201cWe\u2019re still working and upgrading the data on applications. With time, the experience on the system is bound to get better and aid GMDA in all development projects,\u201d said Singh.

I have to pay both, the EMI and rent. I have been undergoing mental trauma ever since I bought the flat\u201d he said. Another buyer asked, \u201cMay I know what the government has done by putting Rera into action without providing any rights to the buyer?\u201d He added, \u201cGoing to the Rera office and talking to the people sitting there makes us feel helpless and nothing more\u201d. \u201cThey launched the project in the year 2010 and it\u2019s 2019. They haven\u2019t provided possession of flats to a single person. Where are the rules and regulations? Are regulations only meant for buyers, who have to pay hefty penalties when they are unable to pay the amount even with small delays? These fraud builders take all the money and infinite time to deliver,\u201d he said. Neeraj Singh, another buyer, said the work in the project is on hold. \u201cWe are getting lots of emails from the developer saying that the possession will be given by November this year, but the work itself has not resumed. Therefore, possession of flats looks difficult as of now,\u201d he said. He further said that he visited the site and saw no progress in the project. When he inquired, he was told that the developer has not paid the contractors since December last year, therefore work hasn\u2019t resumed. Sakshi Molasi, one of the initial buyers, said, \u201cI live in a rented house in Gurugram for the past 6 years. I purchased a unit in L tower 2 years ago as I wished to have my own house. I have already paid 95 percent of my flat price to the builder, but all seems to have gone in vain\u201d. Meanwhile, VP (marketing & customer service), BPTP, Rohit Mohan said, \u201cThe project is registered with Rera Panchkula. We are confident we will be able to deliver the same within 6 to 8 months.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

Multi-storey buildings and residential colonies were built in the sector over a submergence area (flood-prone zone), and licences for these were granted despite warnings of the state\u2019s irrigation department. In several letters written in 2011 (TOI has their copies), to the offices of the district DTCP, deputy commissioner and disaster management department, the Gurugram Water Services Department (irrigation department) had opposed the move to give licences to developers under Master Plan 2025 in the sector. The department had said the state will be responsible for any loss of life or property in case of flood, as the site lay in submergence area of Ghata bund. In the Master Plan 2025, drafted during 2009-2011, DTCP had proposed shifting the alignment of the 28km-long Badshapur drain. It had also started issuing licences to private developers. Over the years, about a dozen multi-storey buildings have come up on plots allotted then, along with some hotels and schools. Over 1,000 families live there now. \u201cThe (building) plan and license (to builders) have been approved by your department, overlooking the importance of storage of water in Ghata bund. In the event of flood, the entrance of flood water in the multi-storeyed flats of Sector 58 cannot (be) avoided as the slope is towards Ghata bund,\u201d states a letter, whose copy is with TOI, sent by the irrigation department to the the district town planner. The irrigation department also sent a notice to the DTP, asking for removal of obstruction to natural flow of flood water to Ghata bund. \u201cIf there is any natural calamity beyond the control of human beings, disaster can\u2019t be avoided and you cannot ignore the factor for the safety of human beings/property. Since private builders, after developing flats/areas, will run away, after that, the liability will fall on the state, for which your department is solely responsible,\u201d states the notice (a copy is with TOI). Yet, according to a letter written by then Union MoS (environment and forests) Jairam Ramesh, licenses were granted to builders on the basis of environmental clearances given by state environment impact assessment authority, as well as Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), the Sohna tehsildar and the forest department, to establish group housing societies and master roads in Sector 58. \u201cI\u2019d like to draw your attention to the submissions made by the state government before high court, in which it has been categorically mentioned that \u201cNo such natural jheel exists in that area. It is rather a local depression, wherein, sometimes, rainwater accumulates due to construction of a flood protection bund. Such bunds are generally constructed for the protection of village abadis from seasonal floods.\u201d  The state government, however, committed that a detailed survey regarding natural features, etc. will be undertaken while finalising the detailed layout plan of the area,\u201d said the letter written by Jairam Ramesh to a petitioner, who moved Punjab and Haryana high court against real estate development in the area. However, the detailed survey has still not been carried out by the government. Environmentalist Colonel (retired) S S Oberoi, who received the information through an RTI response, filed a complaint with the Lokpal against the state government for not carrying out the study before granting licenses to builders in Sector 58. \u201cThe issue is all successive governments have been indifferent and anti-environment.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

The project is expected to reduce the Jaipur-Delhi traffic congestion. The announcement came after Rao Narbir Singh called a meeting with the NHAI and district administration officials last week and discussed the issues raised by the residents of the area. The demolition drive, which had started earlier this month, has been facing opposition from residents. From 30cm to 10 metres, portions of more than 350 houses have to be cleared for the construction of the proposed flyover. As part of the drive, around 1.5 metres of Rao Narbir Singh\u2019s house will also be razed, permission of which has been granted by the minister himself. An official from the district administration told TOI, \u201cThe demolition drive is being carried out according to demarcation. Over 350 structures with portions on government land have to be removed for the proposed flyover. Even certain portions of the PWD minister\u2019s house will be demolished.\u201d Last week, scores of people approached Rao Narbir Singh, seeking redressal of their grievances, after which Singh called the meeting to find the best possible way of completing the demolition drive. At the meeting, NHAI asserted that the project could not be delayed and all the houses in the way of the proposed flyover needed to be cleared at the earliest. The officials also refuted the residents\u2019s claims and asserted that the latter were served notices in advance so that they had sufficient time to make arrangements. \u201cWe have to complete the project at the earliest and for that, we need to, first, claim the government land. We are following due process. In fact, for several months, we\u2019ve been intimating the residents, and sending them notices, as well. Already, the demolition drive has been affected on a couple of occasions. We don\u2019t want any further delays,\u201d said an NHAI official. NHAI is upgrading the 21.66km-long Sohna road in two phases at an estimated cost of Rs 1,300 crore. In the first phase, an elevated road will be constructed from Subhash Chowk to Badshapur village.

Police said the woman is a student of software engineering and had come to India for a year-long internship with an Indian IT major. She had taken up accommodation in Gurgaon and was looking to shift homes when, on a Facebook group, she came across the suspect, a man police identified as Aanjaney. Investigators said he was 36 years old, worked in a production house making animation films, and is an original resident of Anand Vihar in Delhi but was currently living in Gurgaon. Police arrested Aanjaney on Saturday. He was charged him under sections 376 (rape) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC at DLF-1 police station. She said no to sex, he forced himself on herIn her complaint, filed with the help of a friend who acted as a translator, the Spanish woman said Aanjaney had invited her to his house in DLF-1for a party on June 14 and she had reached around 10.30pm. She told cops she trusted him enough to go to his place. \u201cAfter a few hours we started kissing, and we went upstairs to his room. But I did not feel comfortable with the idea of having sex, so I asked him to stop. He then asked me to spend at least the night there, and I agreed,\u201d she said in her complaint. She claimed she had fallen asleep but woken up a while later and found Aanjaney was still in the room and was masturbating looking at her. \u201cI felt very uncomfortable so I decided to return my house but he didn\u2019t let me. I clearly said I was uncomfortable, I didn\u2019t want to have sex but he forced me to stay and raped me. I had to go through the humiliation because I was afraid if I did not do what he asked, it would get worse. He closed the main door, threw my phone away, and forced himself on me,\u201d she alleged. Police said they were first informed about the alleged sexual assault through a phone call to the control room around 9am on Saturday. The Spanish woman came across Aanjaney only on June 12 during her house hunt, investigators said. They hit it off well, so when he called her to the party, she agreed. \u201cI saw a post from Aanjaney offering a room and we got in touch for that,\u201d she said in her complaint. Police said the she was taken for a medical test and her statement was subsequently recorded at a city court. Police said Aanjaney works in an Udyog Viharbased company. He was single and has been living in the DLF-1 bungalow, which they had rented, since January this year with three friends. Ved Prakash, SHO of DLF-1 police station, said, \u201cAltogether, five persons, including the accused and the Spanish woman, were present at the party. The accused invited two friends and one of his housemates. The housemate went to sleep some time later and the two friends went home. When everybody left, he took her to his room and raped her. On Saturday morning, the Spanish woman called a friend who stays in Sector 10, booked a cab and went to her place. They came back together to file the complaint.\u201d Karan Goyal, ACP (DLF), said the accused had admitted to his crime during questioning and would be taken to court for a decision on his custody.

The PGIMS authorities placed the senior professor under suspension on Friday night. Onkar, who hailed from Dharwad in Karnataka, allegedly hung himself from the ceiling of his hostel room on Thursday around 10.30pm, Rohtak police station SHO inspector Kailash Chander said.

The junior doctors in the paediatrics department said all of them were facing mental harassment because of the head of department. The PGIMS residents doctors and the colleagues of the deceased have gone on a strike since Friday morning with a long list of demands, especially working conditions in PGIMS. The strike resulted in paucity of doctors and impacted the OPDs where patients kept waiting for doctors.

They alleged that they were subjected to inhuman working hours and mentioned shocking details of how they were treated by her.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

As many as 40 birds are admitted to the hospital suffering from aforesaid symptoms, and every day a handful of new cases are pouring in. There are 308 birds in the hospital currently being nursed back to health. And, it\u2019s both native and exotic species that are struggling to cope with soaring temperatures, among them rock pigeons, blue rock pigeons, doves and eagles, as well as species of parrot like lovebirds, budgerigars and macaws. While some residents have noticed instances of birds dropping from trees out of sheer exhaustion, many have found them straining to take flight, whether from the ground or terrace. \u201cOn Thursday, I found a dove struggling to open its wing near a water bowl on my terrace. I took the bird to a shady place. I tried to give it some water but the bird was not able to open its eyes,\u201d shared Deepak Lal, a resident of Sushant Lok-3. \u201cI immediately took the bird to the hospital \u2014 the doctor told me that the bird is suffering from heat stroke, but thankfully they managed to save it.\u201d This dove, then, was lucky to escape death. However, on many occasions, birds are dead by the time they are brought into the hospital, because they could not receive relief on time. \u201cUnlike humans, birds can\u2019t have sweat glands \u2014 it is, therefore, difficult for them to escape heat. So, it is extremely important to give early treatment to birds suffering from heat stroke \u2014 if not given timely treatment, birds suffer from paralysis and, sometimes, disability for entire life,\u201d explained Dr. Rajkumar of the Jain Charitable Bird Hospital. Alas, climate change affects avian species as much as it does humans, and ornithologists and bird lovers alike have raised concerns over the increase in cases of heat-related disorders. \u201cUnfortunately, winged creatures are the first victims of an increase in temperature as their organs are small, and thus they can\u2019t retain enough water and nutrients in their body for a long time. Birds, therefore, lose energy very quickly,\u201d informed Kavitha, a city-based birder. \u201cFeeding them water and food after short intervals is recommended. While this can be done in the case of pets, free-ranging birds often find it difficult to get water and food. Thus, they are more prone to heat stroke,\u201d she added. Doctors advise that bird feeders be cleaned regularly, to prevent birds getting infected. \u201cMore than the heat, they struggle to find cold water and shade to rest. People should keep cold water in a shady place on their terrace or ground, for the birds,\u201d told Dr. Rajkumar, who also advised that ORS or electrolytes be added to the water to ensure that they receive sufficient nutrients. And, should a bird be immobilised by the conditions, it would be prudent to take it to a patch of shade, and give it first aid without delay. \u201cIf a bird is found struggling with the heat, the bird should immediately be taken to a cooler place and a few drops of water put on their head,\u201d Dr. Rajkumar suggested. For those sensitive to the plight of our feathered friends, this is advice that can prove to be the difference between life and death.

The entire city has been dug out in the guise of laying underground drainage scheme and left without repair. How shocking it is to see 30 people dying of diarrhoea in a city like Guntur? Is it not the failure of the state government? Opposition leader Jaganmohan Reddy is equally responsible for the tragedy as he never dared to question the government by going to the assembly,\u201d he said. He further said they would construct apartments exclusively for Muslims in the city. He appealed to people to support his candidates Chandrasekhar (Guntur West), Zia-Ur-Rehman (East) and MP candidate Bonaboina Srinivas Yadav in the elections, Pawan said they fielded a BC candidate Srinivasa Yadav whereas TDP and YSRC both have given tickets to their own communities.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Dr Gathwala, who is accused of harassing Dr Onkar to such an extent that he committed suicide, also hinted at internal politics of the PGIMS for her being held responsible for the suicide. In her complaint, Dr Gathwala alleged that the students broke open the gate of her house and the doors around 12.45pm on Saturday, when she, her husband, daughter and son were at home. \u201cThey suddenly invaded my residence and vandalised it. They broke open the gate, doors and windows in a planned and organised manner with criminal intent,\u201d she alleged. The doctor also accused the students of her breaking her furniture, computers, phones, and stealing the keys to her cars. \u201cThey also hurled choicest of abuses at my husband, Dr. Ishwar Singh,\u201d she alleged. She has alleged that the students were instigated by \u201csome people\u201d in her department, who wanted to tarnish her image and damage her reputation for ulteriour motives.

Probe panel found deceased negligent Though doctors had accused PGIMS paediatrics head Dr Geeta Gathwala of getting Dr Onkar framed in a case of medical negligence in January 2018, a probe committe of the premier health institute had found negligence on part of the deceased. Dr Onkar allegedly committed suicide in his hostel room on Thursday night. The case was registered against Dr Onkar after an Army man from Bahu Akbarpur village had alleged that his nine-month-old daughter died due to the doctor\u2019s negligence. Dr Onkar and another doctor were on duty in the emergency department of PGIMS at the time. Dr Onkar was arrested and jailed in connection with the case. Some senior doctors at PGIMS felt the striking doctors were being used to build a case against Dr Gathwala, so that she can be removed as the head of paediatrics department. Dr Gathwala has been booked under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code, for allegedly abetting Dr Onkar\u2019s suicide. A senior consultant at PGIMS Rohtak said doctors across the country were protesting against the attack on them, but even the case faced by Dr Onkar had similar overtones. \u201cThey (students) went to the house of accused Dr Geeta Gathwala and created a ruckus there, and manhandled one of her family members.

The world\u2019s major cities are such power brands. Think of Paris, London and New York, and a plethora of images and emotions are instantly evoked. These cities have been photographed heavily by tourists and professional photographers. Their architectural landmarks are known to millions around the world, including those who have never set foot there. Their streets and culture have been captured in countless movies and hence are familiar not just to residents but worldwide audiences. The black cabs of London and yellow taxis of New York are visual icons. Great authors have set their stories in those cities and made their landscapes famous. In India, the old metros are such power brands: Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai. Mumbai and Delhi, in particular, have been captured in countless photographs as well as movie scenes. Which brings me to Gurugram, which has been home for 12 years now. While being attached to Delhi as part of NCR, Gurugram is a city in its own right, variously described as Millennium City and a corporate hub. New Gurugram is consciously modelled on cities such as Singapore and Dubai, in its design and way of life, with glitzy steel-and-glass downtown work areas (Cyber City), malls and pedestrianised zones (Cyber Hub), and residences in condominiums and gated communities. A huge segment of the city\u2019s population is not local Haryanvis but professionals and workers from various parts of India, or those who have moved from Delhi. Many are also transitory, coming to Gurugram to work for a few years, before moving back to the cities they came from, or to which their professional ambitions take them. Who, then, loves Gurugram? What images and feelings does Gurugram evoke? What does Gurugram symbolise? If it\u2019s just the name of a township, then the attachments are only to friends made while living there, and to a few places in and around one\u2019s residence. But if it is to become a symbol of new aspirations, and dreams of global living (as the names of the various condos would suggest) in a way that evokes pride and not derision, then what is Gurugram defined by? Enough critical commentary has been written on Gurugram by journalists, choosing to see the lifestyle of Gurugram residents as pretentious and wannabe rather than as something deeper and more meaningful. To love Gurugram, it should all start with the question: what should a Gurugram resident be called? How should we identify ourselves? What\u2019s our shared identity (especially now that the city has been officially renamed Gurugram)? Are we Gurugram-ers? Or Gurugrammers? Or just Gurus? Or Gurugram-kars? Or indeed, Gurugram-ites? It\u2019s difficult to turn the city into a power brand if the residents don\u2019t know what to call themselves, if there is no label that falls easily off the tongue (like Parisians and Londoners, or Mumbaikars and Delhiites). So, what parts of the city do we, its residents, feel proud of and happy to show to friends, family and other visitors? Do we love showing off Cyber Hub, Galleria market and Kingdom of Dreams? Or just the gated communities we live in? Which parts of the city would photographers, filmmakers, writers and other creative folk living in Gurugram want to romance through their art and craft? Or is it that the city\u2019s lifestyle of middle and elite class aspiration lacks the sheer tension and human churn that cities like Mumbai and old Delhi have, which inspire writers to romanticise them? As Gurugram grows, will its various areas develop a distinctive enough character to be labelled as neighbourhoods? Right now, sadly, the city\u2019s decision-makers seem to be quite happy to have it live up to its \u2018corporate city\u2019 moniker by getting sponsors for Rapid Metro and turning each of its stations into a corporate billboard. And Gurugram\u2019s resident professionals are all happy to stay here for the convenience and comfort of condo-living and the milling crowds that are a central feature of India\u2019s old and big cities. But, are we willing to love Gurugram? And showcase that love?

The accused posed as employees of Maruti Suzuki, Prasar Bharti and other organisations to cheat people. Police has recovered fake cheques issued in the name of different organisations and fake identity cards of the companies from their possession. Their modus operandi was unique. They impersonated senior officials of Maruti Suzuki India Private Limited and approached owners of big farmhouses, banquet halls and event management firms to strike a deal with them in the name of organising some mega event for the company. They gave account payee cheques of the company and asked for cash commission from the clients for bringing them such big businesses, after which, they would disappear and change their mobile numbers. Commissioner of police Muhammad Akil said, \u201cSo far, they have admitted to having cheated 35 clients this way. We\u2019re hoping to get more details during interrogation.\u201d He added cops have recovered fake cheques, agreements and identity cards from their possession. He also said police is probing the account linked to these cheques, and how the cheats managed to open it. Akil also said the cheats were held in connection with a case of cheating, forgery and impersonation, registered at Manesar police station on June 13, following a complaint by a Shyam Veer Singh, resident of Kalkaji in Delhi, who owns A to Z Tent Decorator and Catering Company. In the line of work, Shyam had met a Vijay Kumar on February 28, 2018, at a mall in Manesar. Kumar offered to help Singh land a big contract. He introduced Singh to Kuldeep Singh, who identified himself as a senior Maruti official. Kuldeep presented Shyam with an account payee check of Rs 39.39 lakh, and a contract letter from Maruti, for organising a big company event in Manesar, and asked for 10% commission, of which he asked Shyam to pay 5% in cash as advance and the remainder after the event. Shyam paid Kuldeep Rs 1.75 lakh. On March 9, 2018 they again met at the same place. This time, Kuldeep gave Shyam a contract letter from Maruti Suzuki India Private Limited and told him the company would inform him of date and venue of event. When complainant deposited the cheque in his bank, it was rejected because \u201cthere was no such bank account\u201d. A worried Shyam tried to contact Vijay and Kuldeep, but both their mobile phones were switched off. He approached Maruti, where he found out that none of the people work with the company. Finally approached police a few months back, and a case was registered last week. Sector 31 crime unit arrested two persons in June 14 in connection with this case from Dhanchiri Tourist Complex near Sirhaul toll plaza. The accused were identified as Vijay Kumar Jha from Bihar\u2019s Darbhanga and Kuldeep Singh from Amritsar.

One cheque, of Rs 84.81 lakh, was issued in the name of a Nirankari event, another (Rs 53.32 lakh) was issued in the name of Chawla Tent House, Panipat.

Not true, say hands-on new-age dads": {"datetime": "", "description": "Fathers can\u2019t multitask, can\u2019t cook, manage household chores along with their work, or can\u2019t balance their professional lives with the personal ones \u2013 these are just some stereotypes that we have grown up hearing. But the new-age dads, who stay in nuclear as well as joint families, where both husband and wife are working, are not only dividing the task of raising kids equally, but also making sure that they are available for their kids for a heart-to-heart conversation, advice on friendships, or period talks. From taking leaves for kids\u2019 exams to cooking and helping them with homework \u2013 things that one would typically expect a mother would do \u2013 are being done by dads quite well, who believe in not just sharing finances, but other responsibilities, too. On Father\u2019s Day, we speak to some dads and mothers leading by example, who tell us about the stereotypes that fathers are subjected to, and how they are breaking them and contributing as an equal parent. Dads not emotional, says who?Ankur Gupta, a doctor and resident of Sector 50, Gurgaon, says, \u201cFathers are not sensitive, kids turn to their mothers if they want to express their feelings; fathers are messy, don\u2019t help in household chores; they are not interested in school grades, and are uncomfortable in parent-teacher meetings \u2013 these are some common stereotypes that most fathers in India are subjected to. Thankfully, these are not applicable to me as at a very early age my daughter realised that she could walk up to me and talk about anything that is bothering her emotionally. I am also interested in knowing about what is happening in her school. There is no division of labour at our home but my wife and I know about the things we are good at, so we take the lead accordingly. I know I am good at language and my wife can manage the finances well, so it is like an unsaid rule that we follow to help our family in that way.\u201d Tilak Chowdhury, a resident of Sector 169, Noida, who works at a consulting firm, adds, \u201cThe stereotypes are not restricted to just, dads can\u2019t cook or look after the kids, often, they are also considered very strict and someone who cannot have fun, or show any emotion in front of their kids. Why can\u2019t people expect a father to be like Anupam Kher\u2019s character in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge who can encourage his kids when they fail, or do not perform well in studies, or can discuss their love lives openly like Rishi Kapoor\u2019s character in Hum Tum?\u201d Can\u2019t discuss heartbreaks with dads \u2013 seriously? You cannot discuss problems related to heartbreaks or seek advice after a fight with friends with your father as they won\u2019t understand them \u2013 new-age dads are trying to break this stereotype. \u201cWe understand and can give useful advice to the kids. Why do people find it so difficult to accept that fathers can also have emotions and kids can have a conversation with us on topics related to heartbreaks or can seek any other emotional advice? I have always been available to my kids whenever they have wanted me. I remember that my elder daughter, now 15, would return disturbed from school. One day, I asked her about what was bothering her as I was concerned. I did not mean to interfere in her personal life, but I told her that she could come up to me whenever she was comfortable talk about it, and I would try to help her in all my capacity. It took her two days to tell me that she was facing problems with a friend, who would often fight with her on petty issues. I told her that it was important to focus on the friendship if it was important to them, they can fight over petty issues but school days won\u2019t come back. We started with this topic and then she opened up about her school life and her friends from the neighbourhood. I was glad that she could tell me everything. That day, my daughter understood that she can discuss her problems with me and I will try to help her,\u201d shares Arjun Singh, a businessman who lives in Rajouri Garden and father to two teenage daughters. Arpana Prakash, who runs a dance school, adds, \u201cWhen I asked my seven-year-old daughter about who would she first tell about her boyfriend, and she said, \u2018Dad.\u2019 That is the comfort level that they share. We could never think about having a talk about menstruation with our fathers but today\u2019s generation surely can.\u201d \u2018Can take care of kids and deal with clients\u2019Raj Hazarika says that he is often asked why he willingly contributes as a homemaker. \u201cThis is something that they expect a woman to do but I like cooking and also enjoy doing it for my kids. Playing, cooking or just being with my kids is important as they are growing up, and this time will never come back. Raising kids is not an easy task, and there is nothing wrong in being equally involved with your partner in doing so. One has to adjust a lot while dealing with kids. I can manage my clients or colleagues easily but dealing with kids and their temperament is another thing \u2013 something that every parent should learn hands- on,\u201d says Raj, a resident of Sushant Lok 2 who runs a coaching academy. For some, it is also a way to bond with their kids. \u201cMy wife is a teacher and she leaves around 6.30am, so I wake up early before my kids leave for school and pack their lunch. I leave for work around 10am, so I have enough time to spend with my kids. We both are working parents, so I don\u2019t see it as a problem that I am cooking for my kids. When I come from work, my kids are often asleep because my wife is with them after school and helps them with the homework. If I have my Saturdays off, then I help them with their homework or extra-curricular activities but that is something I want to do as a parent, and not because somebody is forcing me to. People can think that I am too involved in my family but I am doing this because this is what I want to do,\u201d says Roshan Sharma, a resident of Saket, who works as a consultant in a firm.

The complainant has claimed the harassment started last year, after she was posted at FSL, and has continued even after she was transferred to Gurugram on compassionate grounds on March 28, 2017. Acting on her complaint, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes issued a notice on June 7 to the state chief secretary and DGP, seeking an action taken report within the next 15 days. The complaint states the accused misbehaved with the complainant after calling her to his office, and when she resisted, he allegedly started harassing her to make her give in to his wishes. The complainant has accused other senior officials of pressuring her too, including an ADGP rank officer, accusing the latter of showing bias when she filed a complaint with him on September 27, 2018. On June 1 this year, she forwarded the same complaint to the Haryana DGP and the SC/ST commission, with the addition that in the meantime, a reader (sub-inspector rank) of the FSL director had tried to blackmail her, besides threatening a woman witness. As per her complaint, the department constituted two sexual harassment committees, both of which she claims did not follow guidelines. \u201cA third committee was also formed, but I have so far not been asked to attend its hearings,\u201d she wrote in her complaint, claiming she wants independent inquiry into her case, as all witnesses, who happen to be employees, are scared. \u201cIn her case, there was manipulation of inquiry and witnesses by the committee in favour of the accused, under pressure of the FSL director. I had earlier requested the committee to provide protection to witnesses, as per Supreme Court guidelines under its Witness Protection Scheme, 2018, but this was denied without advice and approval of the Haryana DGP. As witnesses were unwilling to come forward due to threats from the accused, I called and recorded statements of two witnesses, and submitted those in a CD, where they expressed strong fear of the FSL director. Twice already, the commission has issued notices to the state government, but nothing happened,\u201d wrote the complainant. Following this, the SC/ST commission sent a notice to the Haryana chief secretary and DGP (copies are with TOI), demanding an action taken report. \u201cIt\u2019s requested that present status/action taken report on the points raised in the representation may please be furnished to this commission within 15 days positively, for placing the same before the commission,\u201d reads the notice. Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava said so far, he hasn\u2019t received the notice. \u201cThe complaint is under investigation, but I can only speak on it once the inquiry is complete,\u201d he said.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Why, even dating apps are turning to AI to enhance user experience like checking the authenticity of profiles that they are likely to see. But how good is deep tech in searching for a soulmate? And how much can you really rely on AI in matters of the heart?  Shubhra Pant  finds out In an episode of the British science-fiction series, \u2018Black Mirror\u2019, a couple is playing a simulation-based game. They are given multiple scenarios to test their compatibility, and see how their relationship would work. After a favourable outcome, the two decide to pair off and try their luck. While a Black Mirror might make it seem that looking for love is easy, humankind is still far off from such a sci-fi vision. However, companies in the matchmaking and dating business are already throwing in deep tech to better understand tender matters of the heart: after all, if algorithms can customise everything for you, from social media to travel, why not the search for a soulmate? The idea, to begin with, is simple \u2014 use data and algorithms to cut down on time spent on browsing profiles. Because, according to Pawan Gupta, co-founder of Betterhalf.ai, which calls itself a matchmaking app for professionals, Indians go through roughly 10,000 profiles every year, spending around 1,000 hours on dating or matchmaking apps. That\u2019s an average of 28 profiles per day. No wonder the percentage of online swipes to offline dates remains very low.  A kundli for the tech age Betterhalf\u2019s primary objective, says Gupta, is to significantly bring down the number of profiles men and women must browse in their pursuit of matrimony. Artificial intelligence is a tool that can help them achieve that. \"Hence, we use big data and AI to help people find better-suited people on our platform,\" he adds. Unlike a typical matrimonial portal, Betterhalf provides a list of possible matches but doesn\u2019t let you surf. Gupta, interestingly, came upon the idea for an algorithm-based matchmaker when searching for his own partner. He went on to marry her. So, how does it work? Well, after logging in, a user takes a survey in which s/he is asked questions on topics as different as values and beliefs, intellectual levels and social skills, relationships and emotional preferences. The information collated from the questionnaire is clubbed with a separate cache of data collected from surveys of those who are happily married. Then algorithms take a deep dive and fish out what they believe are the best matches for you. As Manoj Singh, an infrastructure developer with a leading financial company who found his soulmate online says, \"It isn\u2019t easy to describe why you like someone and why you dislike someone \u2013 it is an internal process which is difficult to put into words.\" So, sometimes, you just trust the AI and see what happens. Betterhalf currently has around 14,000 (approx.) users in the National Capital Region, 11,000 in Mumbai and Bangalore, and 6,500 in Pune and Hyderabad. Eighty per cent of those registered on the app are from metros. Clearly, plenty of urban Indians are happy to confide in AI to make their life decision for them.  Date with data Figures from data analyst Tracxn show 261 online dating and matchmaking apps were founded in India between 2001 and 2019. And while both Banihal and Betterhalf are new kids on the block serving niches, even established players like OkCupid and Bumble are turning to AI to enhance user experience. Global dating app OkCupid, part of the Match Group (which also owns Tinder), is a case in point, working on the principle of matching users based on their answers to a series of questions \u2014 a function powered by AI. Like Betterhalf, there\u2019s Banihal.com, which also relies on AI to arrange matches. It also asks users to fill in an exhaustive questionnaire, in which they are required to reveal their financial background, family\u2019s monthly income, and likes and dislikes (among other details). \"A great match is when you don\u2019t have to compromise on any of the aspects, such as religion, culture and family,\" says Ishdeep Sawhney, the California-based founder of Banihal. The website caters mainly to Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune, but also has users from Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities in India (and from the US, too). \"When we make this decision, we don\u2019t have hard limits like, the age (of the partner) has to be 27 \u2013 because, depending on all the other unique aspects we like, the age can be 28 as well,\" Sawhney explains. Banihal, he clarifies, restricts itself to professionals aged between 25 and 30 since an AI engine can only be trained for a certain subset, and cannot be randomly applied to everyone. And, once singles have connected with each other, Banihal has a 90% success rate, claims Sawhney (incidentally, on the app, compatibility is represented by three gold rings, while the best matches are distinguished by a diamond ring).  Math of a match For these tech platforms, the key is to save users from the endless cycle of searches. After all, the process of browsing and swiping, does get exhausting after a while. \"The problem is that no one really has the time to go through thousands of profiles and talk to hundreds of people to go on a date \u2013 and even after that, there is no guarantee of these dates working out,\" says a 28-year-old MBA graduate, who requested not to be named. \"I once matched with a man who thought I was too opinionated for a lady when his profile suggested that he was a liberal and feminist,\" she added. Melissa Hobley, chief marketing officer at OkCupid, says the app allows people to connect at a deeper level, through beliefs and interests, for example, rather than just a photo and location. It does this by employing an algorithm centred on machine learning. \"The idea behind the app\u2019s algorithm is to take over the conventional task of being introduced by friends or family in the digital medium,\" she told TOI. \"The deep-math AI has two key differences \u2014 one, the system allows people to connect beyond their social circles, and two, as a non-judgmental platform, users can be their true self and be honest about relationship expectations without the fear of social stigma, making for more meaningful matches,\" she added. And this holds true for every type of relationship, not just heteronormative, according to Hobley. Thus, sex, gender, identity and preference can be shared directly, and the algorithm will present a relevant match. Meanwhile, Bumble, which is partially owned by Priyanka Chopra, believes artificial intelligence can make the app a safer place for its users. Earlier this month, Bumble launched Private Detector, a feature that can capture images in real time with 98% accuracy. Once a lewd image is shared within a chat, the Private Detector will automatically blur that image and alert the user they have been sent something inappropriate. Users can then decide, according to a Bumble spokesperson, whether to view the image or block it. They can also report the image to its team of moderators.  AIs and nays But more personal information on the web, in times when concerns on invasion of privacy, snooping by apps and data collection by online companies, isn\u2019t always a comforting thought. Some users, for instance, find the questions asked by matchmaking websites intrusive. \"While I understand the need for most questions, I don\u2019t understand the need to ask about family income and caste. On the one hand, we are trying to transcend caste and class boundaries, on the other these apps focus a lot on them,\" rues Urvashi Kingrani, an event manager based in Gurugram. Besides, points out Kingrani, AI assumes that people with similar interests and attributes are likely to get along, which isn\u2019t necessarily true in real life. \"Often, totally opposite people make great partners,\" she adds. Further, most apps don\u2019t score very high when it comes to inclusiveness, despite most claiming to serve the LGBTQ community. A Delhi resident disclosed she had sampled many apps but only one worked. \"I tried one app that had an option for LGBT but nothing for transsexuals and pansexuals. In my opinion, there has to be more freedom to define oneself on the app, and what they are looking for.\" Evidently, there will be no dearth of examples when artificial intelligence is no match for the heart (and mind), for all the permutations that algorithms can throw up. Yet, with more and more Indians ending up on dating and matchmaking sites, there\u2019s no reason to disbelieve the marriage of tech and tradition won\u2019t (or can\u2019t) work either. Because, finally, it\u2019s not about how AI uses you, it\u2019s how you use AI.

Everyone in America knew what happened,\u201d explained the photographer. It\u2019s not as if ice hockey was a popular game in the US but such was the hype for the game \u2013 played at the height of the Cold War \u2013 that even Americans who had never watched ice hockey before or didn\u2019t even know the rules tuned in for it. Many Indians would find this scenario familiar. Because today, they will do the same as India and Pakistan face off in an epic Cricket World Cup game (unless the rain has other plans). Cricket might be a religion in India, but there still are plenty of atheists around, many of whom don\u2019t even understand cricket, let alone follow it. And they only end their aversion to the game on one particular occasion \u2013 when India plays Pakistan. The reasons range from peer pressure to a heightened sense of patriotism and even adherence to social decorum. \u2018Cricket-crazy family leaves me no choice\u2019Vamini Sethi, management consultant, 33, GurgaonI will watch the game as my cricket-crazy family will leave me with no choice. It will be on TV all day and all the discussions in the house will be about the match. I don\u2019t follow cricket because I find it too time-consuming and overhyped. There are other sports like hockey, kabaddi that bring glory to our country but go unnoticed. I have nothing against the game; it brings the entire nation together. But it has so many fans, I\u2019m sure it can do with one less. \u2018Don\u2019t usually have time to watch cricket, but will make time today\u2019Ashvarya Sharma, homemaker, 52, DelhiIt\u2019s not that I hate cricket but since I am a homemaker, I have to keep running around doing chores and can\u2019t spend the whole day sitting and watching cricket. But TV pe bhi toh wahi chalta hai din bhar toh dekhna hi padta hai. However, the India-Pakistan game is different. I watch it by choice. It\u2019s not just cricket; it\u2019s almost war-like. The sentiment is different. In fact, today I plan to finish my chores early. Kitchen ki bhi chutti hai uss din. I don't miss a single ball of any India-Pakistan match. \u2018Will watch the match because it is the patriotic thing to do\u2019Ananya Pandey, communication professional, 29, DelhiI really never had anyone in my family who was an ardent cricket fan or watched it for fun, so I never found any company to watch the game or develop a taste for it. The last game I watched was the 2011 World Cup final that India won. I watched because it was a special occasion and it felt like the patriotic thing to do. Similarly, I will watch the India-Pakistan match today because it\u2019s a different rush altogether. As clich\u00e9d as it may sound, as an Indian, any Indo-Pak discussion catches my attention. Specially post the Pulwama attack and the increasing political tensions, I\u2019d like to see how this tension will affect the performances of both the teams. Also, on a lighter note, my boss \u2013 a die-hard cricket fan \u2013 has instructed me to watch this match and cheer for India. 'After balakot strike, anything India-Pak will attract me'Rajat Kothari, banker, 38, NoidaI don\u2019t follow cricket but an India-Pakistan game is not cricket. I don\u2019t understand the rules and the jargon of cricket and prefer football, to be honest. At least, it\u2019s played by more than a dozen countries in the world. But when I will sit with my friends and family to watch the game today, I won\u2019t be watching cricket, I feel I will be supporting India against Pakistan, on all fronts. After the skirmishes recently and the Balakot Air Strike, the atmosphere is such that anything India-Pakistan will attract my attention. This will be my first ever cricket match and I hope India wins. \u2018The only way to socialise today\u2019Ishita Mathur, teacher, 22, GhaziabadI will watch it because it\u2019s a great way to socialise. Today, cricket will be the only topic of conversation. It just doesn\u2019t seem right to ignore that or not be a part of the discourse. So, I will join my family in front of the TV today and watch the game. The reason I don\u2019t watch cricket is because I find it boring. I prefer other team sports like football and basketball. They seem more participative and active. In cricket, it seems only the bowler and batsmen are doing something at a given time while the others are passively involved. 'Flatmates will suck me into the frenzy'Tsering Tashi, research scholar, 29, DelhiI will have to watch it. What else do you do when everyone around you is crazy about it? I live in a flat with three other cricket-crazy boys and they will watch the game. So, I will be party to the frenzy. I grew up watching and playing football and for me, that is the beautiful game. Cricket is just a colonial hangover, not a sport. I have managed to avoid all the other India matches in the World Cup so far but the hype around the India-Pakistan match is such that you get sucked into the maelstrom somehow.

Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.
