You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The FIR has been lodged following an inquiry by the SIT, formed by Punjab and Haryana high court after hearing a petition by Mukul Garg. On August 4, 2017, the Dugri police had arrested Mukul and Ramandeep in ATM fraud cases. In the early hours of August 5, Ramandeep was found hanging from the door of the washroom in police station with her dupatta. After the incident, Garg had filed a petition alleging that the police had tortured the duo the whole night due to which Ramandeep died. He also alleged that, the police cremated Ramandeep\u2019s body the same day, post autopsy, without informing him or her relatives. On March 18, 2019, the HC ordered an SIT probe into thecase. Following the investigation, the SIT officials held three cops negligent. According to the FIR (a copy of which is with TOI), the SIT has stated that despite a separate lock-up available in police station, Ramandeep was kept in a room which was into the knowledge of SHO Dalbir Singh and duty officer Sukhdev Singh. Further the woman cop did not take her dupatta as precaution neither she accompanied Ramandeep to the washroom or stopped her from locking the door.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts.

Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

The special court judge Arun Kumar Aggarwal also imposed a fine of Rs1 lakh on the convict, and in default of payment of fine, he will have to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a year. On 27 May 2015, Dugri police had booked Mahabir (53) of Nazabgarh in New Delhi under the NDPS Act, after he was found in conscious possession of 6kg opium. As per prosecution, on 27 May 2015, a Dugri police party was at the newly constructed bridge on Dugri canal, when it received secret information that Mahabir, son of Mola, who had a white Alto car, supplied opium in different cities of Punjab after bringing it from Rajasthan. That day also, Mahabir was bringing opium in his car to sell it in Ludhiana. Finding the information to be credible, a checkpost was set up by police, and during checking, the Alto car of the accused was seen coming from Doraha side. On seeing the police party, the car driver at once tried to reverse the car, but it was stopped with the help of police personnel, and the driver was apprehended. Police later recovered the consignment from the boot of the car in the speaker box. Police later arrested the accused and produced a chargesheet against him in the court. During the case trial, the accused pleaded false implication. The additional public prosecutor for the state pleaded for punishment to the accused on the basis of prosecution evidence. The court did not find merit in the contention of the accused that he had been falsely implicated in the case. The defence counsel had contended that although recovery in the present case had been allegedly effected on receipt of secret information, and was at a public place, the investigating officer did not join any independent witness in the present case. The court did not find force in the defence contention, and observed that it was unable to agree with the submissions advanced on behalf of the accused. \u201cThe recovery effected in the present case is 6kg opium and such a recovery cannot be said to be planted.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The accused were identified as Ramesh Singh (25) of Parjian Biharipur village, and his sister-in-law Harpreet Kaur. The anti-narcotics wing officials said that as part of a special drive against drug peddling, the police party had set up a checkpost in the area around Friday evening. They added that while checking suspicious persons and vehicles, the police party stopped a motorcycle bearing registration number PB08CV-1094. Cops said during a search of the accused, police recovered 82g of heroin from the possession of the accused. They added that the accused were then booked under sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and were arrested. The anti-narcotics wing officials said preliminary investigation suggested that the accused may have brought the consignment from Moga and were to supply it in Sidhwan Bet. They added that the estimated cost of the recovered consignment in the international market was around Rs45 lakh. The anti-narcotics wing in-charge inspector Navdeep Singh said the family had more than a dozen cases of drug peddling against them. He added that whereas the arrested accused had four such cases against him, his sister-in-law had been booked in a drug peddling case for the first time. The officials said the parents of Ramesh would peddle poppy husk, but their sons shifted to heroin smuggling some years ago because of the small size of consignments and more profit.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

The forum discussed in detail the proposed draft to analyse its merits and demerits. It hailed the merits of the new education policy like enhancement of the right to education from the age of 3 to 18 years, and the provision of early childhood care from ages 3 to 6 by the institution where the child is admitted. The forum said the positive aspects of the policy were enhancing public funding to education, enhancement of funding to research to the tune of Rs20,000 crore, its policy of inclusiveness, categorisation of educational institutions, end of ad hocism by not allowing any temporary teachers, a stress-free examination system, multiple exit and entry points offered in higher education, and raising of general enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education by 50% up to 2030. RGC principal Khuswinder Kumar said: \u201cHimachal Pradesh has bounced back from the semester system, as it is difficult to manage other activities like sports and annual festivals due to limited time in the semester system.\u201d He mentioned that at his daughter\u2019s school, there was a day when they had to clean the class, so such things must be a part of the policy, where students can learn social skills as well.\u201d Participants criticised the policy to dismantle the University Grants Commission and create a Higher Education Council headed by PM, with 50% ministers in it. They also found fault with the policy of disaffiliating colleges from universities and creation of autonomous colleges. Also, the policy on monitoring private educational institutions is not clear. \u201cIt seems that under the new policy, private institutions will flourish by charging a hefty fee from students,\u201d said one of the participants. The participants in the discussion were college/school principals/teachers, academicians, philanthropists, and members of university senates and syndicates. The forum strongly wished the NDA to fulfil its commitment of spending 6% of the GDP on education, which at present is less than 4%. The forum had apprehensions about the funding of education in a federal country where states have little resources. One of the participants said: \u201cThe success of such policies depends on the funding of the union government. Past practices show that the union government\u2019s share in education is decreasing, and the state\u2019s share in the sector is increasing day by day.\u201d The forum also had concerns about the gap between declarations of the NDA government and the reality on the ground. The members found it strange that Reliance University \u2014 which was not yet established \u2014 was accredited as an \u2018institute of academic excellence\u2019, and provided grants of Rs10,000 crore.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

As per the prosecution, Roshan Singh told police that on September 2, 2015, he was coming from Ludhiana to his village in Chuharwal. At about 9.30 pm, Harnek Singh, along with two unknown persons, was standing in the main chowk of the village.

Responding to a complaint, NHAI has also claimed that traffic congestion problem at Jalandhar has been sorted out as the traffic from Ludhiana to Jalandhar and to other destination faced no problem while passing through from the said flyover despite it being partially closed since March 29. Notably, flaw in the design was first pointed out by Jalandhar deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma and commissioner of police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar, who during their visit a few hours after its opening on March 29, found that a bottle neck had been created at the landing of the flyover. The problem arises as width of the flyover is six-lane and just where its landing the road ahead is four-lane wide. At the bottleneck traffic going out from the city also merges with the National Highway. The two officials held that the bottleneck \u2013 junction point of fast traffic on flyover and the vehicles going out from the city \u2013 was too risky and could lead to fatal accidents. Subsequently, one side of the flyover was immediately closed. Vehicles now have to pass through the traffic lights to turn towards Pathankot and Amritsar. However, replying to a series of questions asked by RTI activist and local resident Sanjay Sehgal, who has also filed a separate complaint, the National Highway Authority of India Project director, Gautam Viishal, has claimed that there is no faulty design of PAP flyover. Responding to a question about action taken on complaints (related to faulty design), the NHAI has come up with one line statement, \u201cbeing rectified on its consent from the Concessionaire and its independent engineer\u201d. The NHAI has also revealed that concessionaire (M/s Panipat-Jalandhar NH-1 Tollways Pvt Ltd) and its independent engineer M/s LN Malviya Infra Projects Pvt Ltd jointly inspected the site before opening it for traffic. The concessionaire was earlier known as Soma Isolux NH 1 Tollway Pvt Ltd. In reply to the grievance filed by Sehgal, the Ambala office of NHAI has replied by forwarding the comments of the concessionaire stating, \u201cSafety measures have been taken for the safety/convenience of road users. The additional safety measures have been also taken at the merging point of service road (LHS) from Jalandhar to Amritsar and Main Carriage Way (LHS). With the construction of PAP flyover the traffic congestion problem at Jalandhar has been sorted out as the long route traffic from Ludhiana to Jalandhar-Amritsar and to other destinations passes through from the said flyover.\u201d Sehgal said that he would file a complaint as Ambalabased NHAI office made a false claim of opening up of Ludhiana to Jalandhar-Amritsar side of the PAP flyover for traffic.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

The Centre had announced to create 100 lakh metric tons of silo facilities across the country. Out of this 50,000 MT has been completed by the FCI in PPP mode, through a local firm MRB Patiala Storage Private Limited. Now 50, 0000 MT of wheat will be moved from vulnerable to safe storage. One of the project developers Pawan Bansal said they started working on silos about 1.5 years ago and were now ready to provide additional storage from the current season. It was the first scientific storage facility in the district, he said. The project has come up in Chintanwali village with an investment of over Rs 55 crore. It was a widely-accepted global concept that was introduced in India a decade ago, but it had just started catching the fancy of government even as the country had been losing grains worth $14 billion annually, Bansal claimed. The private developers will run the facility in contract with FCI and would be paid a monthly rent of Rs 1,319 per MT. The state government had recently written to FCI authorities to send stored rice to other states in special trains to make room for wheat produce as the existing storage facilities in the state were full to the brim. Bansal said the farmers would also be benefited by the storage system as the unloading time was almost negligible due to mechanization.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Dikshit is not that important leader.\u201d Kejriwal has been urging the Congress to stitch an alliance in Delhi for the Lok Sabha polls to keep the BJP away from power. Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.

The workers first tried to control the fire, but when it sprawled they called up the fire department. \u201cWe kept on dialling the fire department number, but nobody took the call.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.
