You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The cases are on the rise, they added. According to data available with the health department, 2,418 cases of plasmodium vivax (PV) malaria and 244 cases of \u201cdeadly\u201d plasmodium falciparum (PF) malaria were detected from January to May in Bareilly district.

Out of total cases, 649 cases of PV and two cases of PF were detected in May in Badaun. PF malaria, which is considered as rare in the region, can be fatal if treatment is delayed beyond 24 hours after the onset of clinical symptoms, said officials. However, PV malaria is one of the common variants of the disease and is usually reported in the region. According to officials, cases of malaria are being reported from across Bareilly and Badaun but a majority of the patients who have tested positive hail from Majhgavan, Bhamora and Ramnagar blocks of Bareilly and Dataganj, Samrer, Jagat and Binawar blocks of Badaun. Both Bareilly and Badaun had reported outbreak of malaria last year and health experts said the number of cases are expected to go up during monsoon. Bareilly district malaria officer D R Singh said, \u201cAs the maximum temperature is hovering around 40 degrees centigrade, most of the waterlogged pits have dried up due to intense heat. It has affected breeding of mosquitoes and reduced their density. We are utilizing this time by screening more patients and giving them immediate treatment. If malaria parasite is removed from the bodies of locals, there will be less possibility of the disease from spreading in monsoon when mosquito breeding will be at its peak.\u201d Badaun district malaria officer Vinod Kumar Sharma said, \u201cWe are conducting indoor residual spray at 173 sensitive villages of the four affected blocks of district. Our teams are holding health camps in villages for diagnosis and treatment of people. Besides, district magistrate has ordered the panchayati raj department and village heads to ensure cleanliness to contain mosquito breeding.\u201d Indoor residual spray is also underway in Bareilly\u2019s 218 sensitive villages.

The reserve will reopen on November 15. The season that opened from November 15, 2018 to June 15, 2019, saw an increase in both footfall as well as revenue as against the previous season. Although the current year\u2019s eco-tourism marked an increase in overall revenue and footfall in comparison to the previous season, it fell short of the figures registered in 2016-17, when the jungle tourism was under the direct command and control of PTR administration. The management of jungle tourism is now in the hands of UP Forest Corporation. The revenue earned through jungle tourism has been transferred by the PTR administration to the account of UP Forest Corporation. The current season\u2019s figures reveal that Chuka was visited by as many as 15,885 Indian and 23 foreign tourists generating a total revenue of over Rs 36 lakh. The huts at Chuka were booked by 209 tourists for night stay, the highest figure so far. In the 2017-18 season, 14,885 tourists visited PTR generating a revenue of over Rs 32 lakh. In comparison to this, in 2016-17, PTR saw 16,360 footfall and maximum-ever revenue to the tune of over Rs 37 lakh. Asked why PTR could not match the 2016-17 figures, reserve\u2019s deputy director Adarsh Kumar said that this could be an outcome of sharp hike in entry fee and rates of huts at Chuka. Asked why a tiger foundation had not been set up in PTR as in other reserves, Kumar said the proposal had been sent to the state forest administration on February 17 , 2016 for approval and is still pending. Once the tiger foundation is set up, all eco-tourism revenue will be deposited with it and PTR can use the funds on its own.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The officials claimed that they had managed to control the sub-surface fire and would douse it soon. They said there was no threat to wildlife, flora or people living in the nearby villagers. On Friday, villagers spotted smoke billowing out of the ground in the forest land near Belpahada village under Mohammadi block. When they rushed to the spot, they saw cracks in the soil and flames beneath it were clearly visible. The ground was hot. Forest department officials were called and they identified the phenomenon as sub-surface fire. Sub-surface fires are of low intensity, consuming organic matter beneath and surface litter of forest floor, including plant roots, humus and peat. This fire spreads very slowly and in most cases, it becomes very hard to detect and control such type of fires. They may continue to burn for months and destroy vegetative cover of the soil. On Saturday, JCB machines were deployed in the area to dig up a trench on the ground where the fire was visible. After digging over two feet, a layer of sand was visible. After this discovery, officials were assured that the underground fire had not been very intense and could be doused by showering water on it.

It also hopes that once owners learn about their usefulness, they will not abandon their cattle, which left unattended become a menace for all. It is proposed to manufacture beauty products like organic gau-ubtan (face pack), bio pesticides, organic fertilizers, agarbatti (incense sticks), soap and cow dung cakes from cow urine and dung. . These products will be marketed under the name, \u2018Gau-Shakti\u2019, said government officials. The idea is to ensure that people identify the economic value of bovines even if they are not giving milk or ploughing the fields, they added. \u201cKeeping a cow even if it is not giving milk is useful as the dung of a single animal in a year can produce bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides for 30 acres of agricultural land,\u201d said chief development officer Mahendra Singh Tanwar.

Pressure further mounted on the striking doctors to find a solution to the standoff.

Sub-surface fires are of low intensity, consuming organic matter beneath and surface litter of forest floor, including plant roots, humus and peat. This fire spreads very slowly and in most of the cases, it becomes very hard to detect and control such type of fires. They may continue to burn for months and destroy vegetative cover of the soil. There are four revenue villages in the radius of two kilometers from the forest land. This has sparked fears that if not controlled, the sub-surface fire will consume forest wealth, affect wildlife and people living in the vicinity. According to local villagers, they observed smoke in Jamuniaghat beat of Mohammadi forest area, spanning 25 acres. There were cracks in the soil and flames beneath the soil were clearly visible. The ground was hot. Bur forest department assured villagers that necessary action would be taken to douse the sub-surface fire at the earliest.

He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

Under the PMAY initiative, the government aims to provide affordable housing for urban poor with a target of building 20 million houses by March 31, 2022. According to officials, only 300 people have got registered for residential flats after paying the registration fee while many have not turned up to pay the installment amount. At present, around 400 flats have been completed while the construction of more flats is underway. However, the BDA officials said the affordable houses constructed at Ramganfa Nagar has not found many takers due to its distance from the city.

The move is aimed at providing conveyance to people interested and willing to buy the houses. As the Ramganga Nagar Awasya Yojana is located on the outskirts of the city, many people feel reluctant to visit the site and due to this, the residential scheme hasn\u2019t been popular among the public. Thus, to give it a boost, we have been providing free trip for the people.\u201d He added, \u201cWith last date of the registeration approaching, the number of people visiting the camp has risen. Around 100 people were taken to visit the site through the special bus over the last two days. Since the location is far from the city limits, only one ride is possible. We may increase the trip based on the requirement on the final day.\u201d BDA officials hope that the move will help in quick booking of the houses under the scheme. Ram Singh, a resident of Sindhu Nagar said, \u201cThe residential plots are located on the outskirts. It is around 20 km far from my house. I have just learnt that tomorrow is the last day to avail of the bus service. I will try to visit the site and hopefully will book a house.\u201d Under PMAY, the cost of a finished flat is Rs 4 lakh, but the flats are available for Rs 2 lakh, as a subsidy of Rs 1.5 lakh is being provided by the Centre and the remaining Rs 1 lakh by the state government.
