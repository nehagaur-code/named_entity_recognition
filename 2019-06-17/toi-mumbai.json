You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Chawla was walking towards his car with a bag containing Rs 4 lakh when he was shot in the temple by two masked men. What left his kin baffled and the community of liquor shop owners nervous was that the assailants first shot Chawla and then grabbed his bag. Chawla hailed from an affluent family that has business interests in construction, real estate and restaurants. The Vanrai police and multiple units of the crime branch have been working on the case. \"It's unfortunate that the killers havent been tracked down. The investigators seem to be trying their best,\" said Sumit, Chawla's brother. He added that the police had checked out the backgrounds of current and past employees at Chawla's wine shop. On June 10, 2018, Chawla shut his shop, Goregaon Wines near Virvani Industrial Estate, around 11.20pm. He started walking towards his car parked 100 metres away, accompanied by an employee named Kamlesh Yadav. Suddenly, two masked men in black cloth walked up with a pistol and shot Chawla in the left temple. The bullet exited from under his eye. As Chawla screamed in pain, the robbers picked up his bag of cash and fled. Yadav, who was unhurt, held a profusely bleeding Chawla and yelled for help. Some of the staffers heard him and alerted a patrolling police vehicle. Chawla was taken to the Bal Thackeray Trauma Hospital and then moved to Kokilaben Ambani Hospital where he died. Chawla was a well-built six footer and had never received threats from anyone. \"Surveillance camera footage and cellphone data dump was minutely scanned. We went through crime files to look for robbers that had struck in the past using a similar modus operandi elsewhere. Each such person was quizzed. Overall, more than 150 people have been questioned at different points.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

On screen is a digital version of a tanpura that lets out a drone as the 15-year-old tunes it to the right scale, balances it between the kitchen vessels and tries to match her voice to the octaves as she kneads a giant sphere of dough, rolls it between her palms and whips up a few dozen rotis for her family\u2019s dinner. Bhagyashali sings in Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Marathi, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marwari and English with equal ease and behind that clear and flawless sur and taal, few can decipher that she cannot speak all these languages nor can they tell that Bhagyashali is now on her way to taking centre stage before an audience of 4000 that will include the city\u2019s rich and famous. The simple act of singing has become the catalyst for a radical project called Mitti Ke Sitare in which children from low-income communities of Mumbai\u2019s sprawling metropolis, are being given the chance to punch through the poverty cycle with the help of skills learned through music and singing. Bhagyashali is among 18 others who have made it to the final rounds of the talent show that over the last six months has worked with more than 500 young people between age seven and 15 who might never have had a chance otherwise to hold a public platform or stand on a stage and show off their skills. When TOI met Bhagyashali along with Hina Kori and Shabana Shaikh \u2013 three 15-year-olds gearing up for the singing face-off on Saturday \u2013 the teenagers were absorbed in filming themselves singing a film tune. Somewhere in that mix of teenage yearning and drive for singing, what was conspicuous was the absence of any rivalry. \u201cMore than winning, it\u2019s about proving that we have talent. And even if we don\u2019t win, we feel confident of ourselves and in expressing ourselves today, be it to our parents or an outsider,\u201d says Shabana who lives in Lakshminagar\u2019s slum cluster. Unlike reality shows aimed at creating saleable content to plump up TRP ratings, Mitti ke Sitare is an effort to combat the elitism of creative industries and a pet project for Amruta Fadnavis, banker and wife of Maharashtra\u2019s chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about a journey to the finals but about inclusivity in the arts. Music is a powerful equalizer and our intention is to spot and nurture talent among kids who do not have the resources to pursue their creativity and written off even when they are capable,\u201d she explains. The germ of the idea emerged a year ago when Fadnavis met a little girl at a friend\u2019s place with \u201ca lot of talent but no outlet\u201d. Put together by Divyaj Foundation that she founded three years ago to empower the less privileged, interested children across 1187 municipal schools were asked to sing a few notes and upload it on an online server and out of the 6000 odd voices that did, those with potential \u2013 527 kids \u2013 were promptly chosen for further rounds before the board of evaluators zeroed in on 18 singing talents. Currently undergoing rigorous mentoring and grooming sessions, the children will take the spotlight at the NSCI Dome next Saturday and have among their audience, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Jerry \u2018Wonda\u2019 Duplessis, the Grammy Award-winning music producer for American popstars like Justin Bieber, Shakira, John Legend and others. \u201cThere were challenges too because for families struggling to make ends meet, work is always more important.

The walkways on both sides of the bridge, a key east-west connector, are now usable but their width has been reduced from 3.5mt to 2mt. Western Railway came in for much flak after the pedestrian section of the bridge collapsed on July 3 last year, killing two and injuring three. The collapse was blamed on the extra load placed on the cantilever section following widening of sidewalks and laying of cables. On Sunday morning, when the bridge was opened to traffic, Dhaval Shah, chairman of Andheri-Lokhandwala Oshiwara Citizens\u2019 Association, said: \u201cThe width of the road and walkways is reduced on either side... This is uncalled for. Also, during inspection, we noticed loose gravel and sand on the bridge. This is shoddy work.

However, Western Railway officials said the work has been \u201cmeticulously\u201d done and there is no danger to pedestrians or motorists. Chief spokesperson of Western Railway, Ravinder Bhakar, said it took nearly a year to finish work as it could only be done at night to avoid traffic disruption.

RPI chief Ramdas Athawale has proposed the name of his trusted aide and activist Avinash Mahatekar. The Sena is reportedly insisting on promotion of at least one of its ministers of state to cabinet rank and the induction of one cabinet and two ministers of state. Fadnavis had been promising a reshuffle for more than three years but had been unable to take a decision owing to differences with the Sena, particularly over induction of a Sena nominee as Deputy CM. The reshuffle was necessitated following vacancies in the cabinet. While agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar passed away, food and civil supplies minister Girish Bapat was recently elected to the Lok Sabha, and health minister Deepak Sawant\u2019s term as legislative council member ended last year. The current strength of the cabinet is 38 \u2013 22 cabinet members and 16 ministers of state.

According to reports, those legislators who are to be inducted in the state cabinet on Sunday were summoned to the CM\u2019s official residence Varsha on Saturday night.

Dr Santosh G Honavar, editor of the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology, has noted in a recent article that around 20,000 newborns need ROP management. A study undertaken closer home by Dr Sucheta Kulkarni of H V Desai Eye Hospital in Pune showed that almost three-fourth of the children who had turned blind due to ROP hadn\u2019t been been screened for the condition. \u201cWe looked at the history of 66 children who come to our hospital with ROP blindness, and the majority of the parents said that they had never been told about the screening,\u201d said Dr Kulkarni. Screening entails looking at the retina using a special lens; extra blood vessels growing throughout the premature baby\u2019s retina can be easily spotted within a few weeks of birth and treated. Pune district has a network of technicians who have the special screening device attached to a digital camera that they use to look at a premature baby\u2019s eyes and send the image to a doctor sitting in H V Desai Hospital. \u201cROP is detected in metro cities such as Mumbai and Pune but there is no system beyond even a few kilometres outside city limits,\u201d she said. Incidentally, most of the affected children in Dr Kulkarni\u2019s study were born in smaller cities that now boast NICUs. Pediatrician Dr Bhupendra Awasthi of Surya Hospital, Santa Cruz, said ROP is now routinely detected and treated in cities such as Mumbai. \u201cThere has been a lot of improvement in the last five years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rule is that every child born before 32 weeks of pregnancy should be screened for ROP,\u201d he added. Dr Jalali said ROP-related blindness seems worse because it is preventable. \u201cAs these blind babies grow up, all healthcare personnel will have to answer them as to why they went blind when knowledge and technology were known at least 30 years ago in countries from where we imported the incubator and newborn survival technology,\u201d said Dr Jalali, adding that \u201csafety nets should have been transferred along with technology\u201d.

She gave birth to a baby boy in 2010 and moved to Andheri in a rented house that he got for her. In 2017, he told her that due to business problems it would be difficult to pay her rent and expenses. In February 2018, the complainant came across his Facebook profile which showed he was married to a woman in Kerala. When she questioned him, he threatened her with dire consequences, the police said. A case under IPC sections for rape, insult and criminal intimidation has been registered. Oshiwara police will issue a lookout circular to nab the suspect.

On Sunday, he was inducted as the minister for school education, sports and youth welfare. The move assumes significance as it comes during admission season. These departments were earlier held by Vinod Tawde, who will be now left with higher and technical education, welfare of minorities and Marathi language. Shelar, who started his political career during his student days in 1988 with ABVP, was seen as a potential state-level leader. A law graduate and two-term corporator, he became an MLC in 2012 before contesting the assembly polls in 2014. Meanwhile, he got opportunities to prove himself as a election strategist in the 2017 civic polls. During his term, BJP\u2019s tally in the BMC reached up to 83 when Sena-BJP contested separately. He has also been actively focussing on the city\u2019s civic infrastructure and other issues. He is said to share a good rapport with Amit Shah as the BJP national president has visited him at his residence several times during his Mumbai visits. Shelar is involved the sports sector, taking a cue from NCP chief Sharad Pawar. The former chairman of Mumbai Cricket Association also held the post of chairman of BCCI marketing committee. He worked with the Mumbai football association and Rope Skipping Association and has been vice chairman of the Rajasthan Sports Club. In BJP circles, the CM's decision to give school education department to Shelar is being viewed as a setback for Tawde. In the other decisions during the reshuffle, Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar has been given food & civil supplies, consumer protection, skill development, ex-servicemen welfare, while Jaykumar Rawal will head food & drugs administration, tourism, protocol and Subhash Deshmukh will head cooperation, relief and rehabilitation departments.\u2019 Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "time": "2019-06-17 09:11:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bjp-mumbai-unit-chief-leaps-to-big-league-lands-school-education/articleshow/69819410.cms"}, "Mi Days on Amazon": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/mi-days-on-amazon-get-up-to-rs-6500-off-on-redmi-y3-mi-a2-redmi-note-5-pro-and-more/articleshow/69819589.cms", "description": ""}, "\nSpecial screening of 'Chaar Sahibzaade \u2014 Rise of Banda Singh Bahadur' in Mumbai\n": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Its-3D-time-in-B-Town/articleshow/55370816.cms", "description": "The makers of director Harry Baweja\u2019s 'Chaar Sahibzaade \u2014 Rise of Banda Singh Bahadur', Eros International and Baweja Movies Pvt Ltd, had organised a special celebrity screening of the 3D animated movie, which hit screens yesterday.

Opposition leader in the BMC and Congress corporator Ravi Raja welcomed the move. \u201cIt\u2019s a good decision to have more buses and reduce the minimum fare.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

For, five of the new ministers are from Vidarbha and three from Mumbai. Besides, five belong to the OBC category. Analysing the reasons for greater representation to OBCs, a political analyst said, \u201cThey might have taken a lesson from the LS polls\u2014one of the Vidarbha constituencies elected the only Congress MP (Bala Dhanorkar) in the state. Also, the BJP\u2019s strongest leader in the state, Nitin Gadkari, could not win by the margin he expected in spite of working hard for his constituency.\u201d Gadkari won Nagpur seat by a margin of 1.97 lakh votes. Another reason for the focus on Vidarbha and OBCs could be an effort to assuage sentiments of the region\u2019s voters amid the drought and farmer suicides. According to an expert, this may also help ensure that the old demand of separate statehood is not raised again during the assembly polls. Amid these moves, Pune, which sent eight BJP MLAs to the assembly and had two ministers till recently, will now be deprived of any ministerial representation. For Dilip Kamble, the only ministerial representative from Pune, was dropped in the reshuffle. The other minister, Girish Bapat, who was elected as MP recently, resigned from the assembly. An analyst recalled that when the Maratha quota was announced, there was anxiety within the OBC community that if the new reservation plan gets stalled due to to legal issues, the Maratha community might get a share from the OBC quota. The cabinet expansion seems to be partly an effort to send a message that OBCs won\u2019t be neglected, the analyst said, pointing out that Anil Bonde, Sanjay Kute, Atul Save, Parinay Fuke (all from BJP) and Jaydutta Kshirsagar of Sena are from OBC category.

Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

The 40-foothigh fountain, which once stood at Metro Cinema junction at Marine Lines, is being restored at the Bhau Daji Lad Museum in Byculla. The metal will be required to ensure that the missing parts are well-fitted, said officials. Attempts are being made to use the same metal which the fountain was originally made of. \u201cWe took samples from various parts of the fountain after dismantling the structure. This was done to check if the structure was made of cast iron,\u201d said an official. \u201cWe found cooper in a few parts. We have tried to get the same metal with the same chemical composition to prepare the missing pieces.\u201d One reason for doing this was if another metal were used, there were chances that it might not agree with the original metal, said the official. \u201cThat could affect the structure,\u201d the official said. Finding of copper had officials a bit worried. \u201cThat is so because if large parts of the fountain required cooper, it would spike the restoration costs drastically. However that was not the case...\u201d To test the existing metal of the fountain, samples were sent to a metallurgical laboratory in the city and the reports received from the lab have been preserved for future reference. The 40-foot Fitzgerald fountain was erected in 1867 even before the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act 1888 that governs the BMC came into force. Conservation architect Pankaj Joshi, who is overseeing the restoration of Fitzgerald fountain, said that the patent drawings of the fountain which they were able to trace have become the basis to help recreate the fountain to its original form. \u201cSo, the recreation of the fountain is being done on accurate documentation available of that period,\u201d said Joshi. \u201cSo, there\u2019s no conjecture.\u201d A lamp has been missing from the existing structure\u2026 But we are making every attempt to bring it back to life in its actual formm: said the official. The small lamp atop the fountain will be recreated in a bigger form. With the Fitzgerald fountain expected to be restored and erected by early next year, this will be the second British-era water fountain in the city to get a face lift. In January this year, the Flora Fountain sprung back to life. However, unlike the Fitzgerald fountain, which is a cast iron water fountain, Flora fountain is made of Portland stone.

He wrote the letter in reference to the Maharashtra government's proposal for developing affordable housing on salt pan lands. The letter states, \"It is understood that as per Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules, salt pan lands are ecologically sensitive areas which are NDZ, except the exploration of natural gas and extraction of salts. However, if the state government allows construction activities on salt pan lands, it will deliberately defile the ecological balance of the financial capital. It is extremely unfortunate to watch this happen even after the World Health Organization (WHO) listing Mumbai as one of the most polluted metropolitan cities in the world.\" He further said that the proposed plan of developmental activity on salt pan lands will do more harm than good to Mumbaikars for various reasons. \u201cI therefore strongly feel that salt pan lands need to be preserved rather than allowing developmental activity,\u201d said the letter. \"....Salt pan lands are at a touching distance from marshy areas near estuaries and creeks, and are important for biodiversity. I would request that the state government should preserve the same instead of allowing construction activities and examine the feasibility of using land parcels held by public sector undertakings (PSUs), railway lands, defence lands, etc for affordable housing,\" concludes the letter.

Experts said in certain areas where coastal road construction is on, existing storm water drains (SWD) have not been extended and given an outlet into the sea. \u201cCoastal road construction has blocked outfalls at several locations. Embankments, especially at Worli and Amarsons Garden, could lead to serious flooding in upstream areas on outfall channels,\u201d said Pankaj Joshi, executive director, Urban Design Research Institute. He added metro work has disturbed the SWD network in several areas, which is a big concern, especially at Fort. Traffic police have identified 20 frequent waterlogging spots between Colaba and Wadala and submitted the list to the BMC for action. Activists have warned that fixing SWDs and even manholes in a haphazard manner could lead to floods. \u201cTemporary service roads have been made from Nepean Sea Road till Worli by the coastal road construction team and SWDs of a small diameter have been installed at inappropriate height through these service roads. Waterlogging is likely during high tide days,\u201d said activist Dr Nilesh Baxi. He further said that multiple manholes were fixed in a zigzag manner along the stretch between Tardeo and Haji Ali. \u201cSubstandard material used for constructing manholes makes them weak and leads to formation of potholes. Multiple potholes can be dangerous during flooding and open manholes might not be seen. Traffic jams also occur due to this,\u201d said Baxi. Frequently, waterlogging at Masjid Bunder stalls the railways but BMC officials have assured there won\u2019t be a repeat this year. \u201cWe have five flooding spots in B Ward, of which two are critical. One is a culvert at Masjd Bunder and the other at Sandhurst Road. This time, we have put up three pumps at each of these places. One of the pumps is set up near the culvert while another is where the outfall is connected. The effect of high tide on the culvert will be handled through floodgate and pumps,\u201d ward officer V Rahi told TOI. While the BMC said 100% desilting work has been completed in the city, councillors alleged this is not the case. \u201cCentralized contracts are given out to agencies, zone-wise, for cleaning SWDs and manholes. Twenty five per cent work has to be done by machines under the contract and the rest through labourers at ward level. But the work supposed to be done by machines hasn\u2019t happened in parts of E-Ward, including Nagpada,\u201d said corporator Javed Juneja. Breach Candy, Mahalaxmi, Maratha Mandir and Sleater Road are low-lying; storm water needs to be pumped out as permanent measures are still not in place. Nana Chowk and Tardeo are at the bottom of a slope and storm water needs to be diverted. The BMC needs long-term measures, said experts.

Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital.

Government authorities woke up to address key issue that causes such incidents-\u2014scientific trimming of trees and providing breathing space to tree roots after removing concrete structure around them. The BMC put out a tweet to this effect on Saturday. The BMC started removing concrete around trees and put soil at some places in the city. The civic body also started using a ladder for proper trimming of trees. In neighbouring Thane, the municipal corporation directed the public works department to immediately replace the cement, concrete walls around tree trunks in public places with soil to ensure their stability, especially during rains. In Mumbai, 383 incidents of tree fall and 120 branches collapse have been reported in last one week. Three people died in last three days at Malad, Jogeshwari and BARC Colony. Most incidents have been reported from the western parts of the city. In the past, activists have highlighted how concrete around trees blocks the roots, causing the tree to collapse. They have also raised issue of manual trimming where workers cut branches just on lower level, leaving the upper part of the trees untouched which makes them more dangerous. \u201cWe are removing concrete around trees at some places,\u201d said a BMC officer. \u201cAt other places, it will be done after the monsoon.\u201d The municipal commissioner convened a meeting with tree experts and forest officials on Monday to find a solution and reduce number of tree collapse incidents. Thane city has lost at least 3,050 trees over the last four years which, experts said, is mainly due to faulty concretisation work done around the trunk of trees. \u201cThane civic chief Sanjeev Jaiswal had in 2016 asked public works department to remove concrete around tree trunks, but the work was left incomplete,\u201d said Omprakash Divte, incharge, gardens department.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

The Western Railway (WR) has completed the construction of walkways on both sides of the bridge and strengthened the girders. The bridge, which has a cantilevered structure, had protruding 3.5-metre-wide walkways attached to its main deck. The width of the walkways has been reduced from 3.5 metres to two metres, of which only 0.5 metres protrudes outside. The other 1.5 metres has been carved from the main deck itself to reduce stress on the structure.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Sources said the objective was to increase ridership, which has fallen drastically over the years, to 50 lakh from the present 25 lakh. It will also encourage more office-goers to use public transport, thus reducing the congestion and pollution caused by private cars. Pardeshi, who is positive about reviving the cash-strapped BEST, has also proposed having more AC buses on busy routes, with at least 200 smaller AC buses hitting the roads by October-November, and increasing the BEST fleet to 6,000 buses in two years. He also suggesting introducing an app to provide live tracking of all buses with the \u201cexpected time of arrival\u201d, to ensure that passengers wait for buses and do not switch to autos or taxis. BEST general manager, Surendrakumar Bagde, said he will be meeting Pardeshi on Monday to finalise the new fare structure and other sops to be given to passengers, and the related financial burden. \u201cWe expect BMC to compensate for the losses incurred by providing highly subsidised fares,\u201d he said. This kind of fare reduction would mean a death knell for share autos and taxis on feeder routes, he added. \u201cWe expect 450 Mini/ Midi AC and non AC buses to hit the roads by November, and 80 electric buses by year end. These will be mainly deployed on feeder routes,\u201d he stated. Shashank Rao, leader of the BEST Workers\u2019 Union, who had signed the MoU allowing the wet leasing of smaller buses, is also the leader of the the largest autorickshaw union in the city. He believes that the MoU is in the best interest of the BEST workers, and that the auto business will not be hit. Further, Rao demanded a crackdown on the illegal autos plying without permits and driver badges. Pardeshi, who is keen to strengthen the city\u2019s public transport, said that buses should have more visibility on roads, should be affordable for commuters and efficient in service. The areas which are likely to witness more AC buses in the near future include Fort, Churchgate, Nariman Point, Lower Parel, Mahalaxmi, Elphinstone Road, Dadar, Malad, and Goregaon, among others. The app will also be launched once BEST implements its Intelligent Transport Management System.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The move is on the lines of what TOI had reported on Sunday. By inducting five ministers from Vidarbha, three from Mumbai and two each from Marathwada and Western Maharashtra, the reshuffle is expected to meet regional demands for more representation and strengthen BJP-Sena\u2019s reach for the polls. Former Congressman Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil who is yet to officially join BJP, former NCP MLA Jaidutta Kshirsagar who recently joined the Sena and BJP\u2019s Mumbai unit chief Ashish Shelar are among the eight cabinet ministers; RPI (Athawale) leader Avinash Mahatekar is among the five junior ministers. They were all administered the oath of office by governor Vidyasagar Rao. Vikhe Patil will be the new housing minister, replacing Prakash Mehta who faced a Lokayukta probe in a slum redevelopment case. Vikhe Patil expected to add to BJP\u2019s cloutBesides, Sena\u2019s Kolhapur MLA Rajesh Kshirsagar was appointed chairman of the State Planning Board with cabinet rank. Fadnavis said the reshuffle was an attempt to give an opportunity to new faces. \u201cWe have inducted several new faces, most of them are young. I am sure they will bring in change and provide result-oriented administration. About the cabinet members who have been dropped, it will be wrong to say their performance was dismal. We made the changes for new faces,\u201d Fadnavis said. This is the third cabinet expansion after Fadnavis was sworn in as CM on October 31, 2014. The induction of Vikhe Patil and Kshirsagar assumes significant political importance in view of the upcoming assembly elections. The BJP expects that Vikhe Patil\u2019s entry will help the party in North Maharashtra, while the Sena feels it will further strengthen its base in Marathwada in view of Kshirsagar\u2019s entry in the party. \u201cWe expect that before the assembly polls, more Congress and NCP leaders will join either BJP or Shiv Sena. All will not be admitted, entry will depend on elective merit,\u2019\u2019 the BJP minister said. \u201cFadnavis has made an attempt to maintain regional balance, as well as the caste and community combination. Now, adequate representation has been given to all regions across the state,\u2019\u2019 a senior BJP minister said. The average age of the 13 new ministers is 55 years. Over a query of deputy CM post being given to Sena, the CM said there was no such demand from Uddhav Thackeray and two Sena nominees have been made ministers on his recommendation. He said BJP would aptly award Ranjitsinh Mohite Patil for his efforts in the LS elections. Patil recently joined the BJP after defecting from NCP.

In the plea moved before the Andheri magistrate court in April, Kushal Agarwal from Chembur alleged that due to mismanagement of the organisers, Punjab Sanjhi Sabha, and its officebearers, no separate running path, away from vehicles, was chalked out for participants. An avid marathoner, the father of one said that the injuries left him unable to participate in any other races. While a case was registered against the car driver, no action was taken against the organisers despite Agarwal\u2019s requests. Aggrieved, Agarwal moved court through his lawyer Prakash Wagh. The complaint was filed against the organisation and office-bearers, Kamal Deep Singh, Surjeet Singh and Surjeet Singh (Longia). Agarwal said that the 9km marathon was held on November 26, 2017. He said that around 200 participants, including children, were part of the event. \u201cThere was a separate category for children. While we were waiting to start around 6.45am, I was shocked to see many vehicles, including trucks, moving along the route. I thought the area would be cordoned off just before the race,\u201d Agarwal said, adding that there were no barricades. In his plea, Agarwal said that he had paid Rs 350 towards participation form and the marathon T-shirt. He said the organisers had assured him they had all permissions and they had followed safety measures. Agarwal said that at 7am when he reached the petrol pump near Chandivli, the car dashed him, his friend, and another participant. \u201cAfter the accident, the injured and I, went to hospital by rickshaw.

Seven people who ran courier agencies in the city have been arrested. Officials said the gold was in the form of bars and biscuits and weighed between 100 gm and 1 kg. Besides the gold smuggled through the Indo-Myanmar border, officials found gold had also been illegally brought in from Dubai and some of the seized gold had Swiss markings. Some gold bars had been tampered with to conceal the country of origin. DRI officials said it was not clear how the gold reached Myanmar. The strategy was to transport gold smuggled through Kolkata, Hyderabad and Delhi airports to the city with the help of small-time courier agencies for a fee. The courier agencies charged between Rs 200 and Rs 700 per kg (the legal courier fees per kg) gold. DRI sources said the courier companies received the parcels at the cargo terminal. The consignments would arrive without the address of the consignee being mentioned. A call would be made to the sender and, based on instructions, the gold would be delivered. The smuggled gold was delivered to jewellers operating in Kalbadevi, Zaveri Bazaar, BKC and other places in Mumbai for a hefty commission. Following a tip off, the DRI intercepted 12 cargo consignments at the office of Concor Air Ltd, an agency that deals in domestic air cargo, at Santacruz.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

Initially, a six-member team of civic officials went through the debris in the hope of getting at least a piece of paper as a clue to the elusive dumper that dumped the debris on the arterial stretch. The civic body even offered Rs 10,000 reward to anyone who could provide information about the dumper. They met with no luck. It was then that the team decided to split into three groups of two. The teams visited three police stations in the neighbouring areas to browse the CCTV footage from their respective localities. Unfortunately, N M Joshi Marg, Tardeo and Worli police stations had nothing to offer in terms of identifying the dumper\u2019s registration number. The area where the debris was dumped was not under the CCTV coverage there. As a last resort, the team approached the traffic police control room to check its CCTV footage as the resolution is better. The team finally got a breakthrough: It spotted a dumper carrying debris near N M Joshi Marg. The officials tracked its movement which showed it going towards Worli with the debris and returning empty. The officials scanned the images further, hoping to get the number of the vehicle. Officials found the number and with the help of an app, traced it to a contractor who was hired by BMC officials from another ward to transport debris. The contractor has been suspended and the BMC has written to the police to register a case. The same dumper had dumped debris in another area of the ward last month too, but had gone unnoticed. Dumpers must dump debris on dumping grounds. Several times, though, dumpers avoid travelling the long distance to the dumping ground and illegally empty out in nearby areas. Last Wednesday, TOI had highlighted how the peak hour snail-paced rush on a Worli arterial road extended till 10am. For, around 12 tonne, or a truckload, of construction debris was found dumped on a southbound lane of Lala Lajpatrai Road, between Lotus and Haji Ali junctions, blocking the traffic movement the entire stretch. It was only around 10am that the debris was cleared and vehicular movement normalized. Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi took serious note of the incident and asked officials to track down the culprit. Devendra Kumar Jain, assistant municipal commissioner of G South Ward, asked his officials take up the issue on a priority basis and announced Rs 10,000 reward. Ward official said they got the dumper\u2019s registration number after examining the footage from multiple CCTVs.

In the recent past, Deshmukh and a section of leading Marathi litterateurs had pointed out that the BJPled state government was not initiating concrete measures to promote Marathi. Pointing out that the government was planning to close down 5,000 Marathi schools, a former professor had asked the government if the department of Marathi had an action plan to revive closed Marathi schools, when it would start an independent Marathi University and if there was a comprehensive plan to set up a language development authority. Stung by the flak, Tawde asked the critics to list out what they had done and if they had a road map for the state government. Tawde asked Deshmukh to list out what he had done to promote Marathi, particularly when he was Collector. Tawde claimed ever since he had taken over the reins of the school education department, he had taken all possible steps to make Marathi compulsory in all schools. Marathi is compulsory in CBSE and ICSE schools up to Std VIII, he said. Tawde said he was surprised over the manner in which activists were suddenly getting their hackles up over the issue, particularly when his government was committed to promote Marathi. Justice Chaudhary moves to greener pastures Nagpur-based Justice Arun Chaudhary is probably the first retired judicial official to secure a plum assignment outside Maharashtra. A month ago, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh appointed him chairperson of the Punjab Real Estate Appellate Tribunal (REAT) as well as the State Education Tribunal. A former government pleader in Nagpur, Justice Chaudhary was appointed Bombay HC judge in September 2006. Subsequently, he was shifted to the Punjab and Haryana HC in April 2016 and he retired in April 2019. Justice Chaudhary\u2019s appointment assumes importance as it is binding on REAT to dispose of appeals in a time-bound manner. Alarmed by large scale irregularities in the real estate sector, the Centre had, in 2016, enacted the landmark legislation, Real Estate (Regulation) and Development Act, 2016, to protect home buyers and bring in transparency and accountability in the construction industry. Maharashtra was the first state to bring in a law for protection of real estate investors. Later, the Central government, too, enacted a comprehensive legislation, following which the state law was automatically repealed.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

As the day wears on, Mhatre, a resident of Shirki village near Pen in Raigad district, uses the same water stored in containers for various household purposes including washing utensils. In Shirki, numerous pipelines, many buried or passing along the drains, are visible. A large overhead water tank too looms over the settlement. But not a drop flows through these pipes or into the tank. Mhatre and her neighbours have to trudge close to two kilometres to wash clothes using saline creek water or muddied water supplied to a government storage tank. For other needs, Mhatre is at the mercy of tankers, which charge her Rs 100 for a 150-litre barrel of water. Mhatre uses the tanker water sparingly for purposes like drinking, bathing and for rinsing clothes and utensils washed in dirty water. She makes do with a few barrels for the whole week. A kilometre away in Bori village, women wash their utensils in light green coloured water, which is not fit for consumption. The same water, collected from a nearby stagnant pond, is used for everything from washing clothes to utensils to even Ganesh chaturthi immersions. Not only is the water turbid, it is ridden with chemicals. \u201cCan you imagine after 70 years of Independence, people of Kharepat region in Pen taluka, which has about 38 villages, do not have access to drinking water,\u201d says Ravindra Mhatre, deputy sarpanch of Bori village. Shirki, Mhasad Budruk, Mhasad Kurd, Masad Bhedi, he said, are the worst affected. Local self-government agencies which supply tanker water form the main lifeline for these settlements, but they are few in number and come infrequently. Recently, JSW Steel, which has a unit nearby, also began providing tanker water as part of CSR activities. But these supplies do not suffice and villagers have to depend on private tankers for their needs. \u201cWater flows in the pipelines passing through here every alternate day for two hours a day, but that water does not reach us or villages ahead,\u201d says Mhatre. Similarly, the overhead tank has a capacity of one lakh litres but lies empty. Ganesh Patil, whose wife Dhanashree is the sarpanch of Shirki, says \u201cThe Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP) built the overhead tank in 2000 and the tank is meant to supply water to 15 villages in the vicinity. But except for a trial, the tank has not seen water in the last 20-odd years.\u201d He said the acute water shortage had taken a toll on productivity as well as earnings. \u201cSome people here earn 200 rupees per day. How do you expect them to spend Rs 100 per barrel of water?\u201d Periodic water scarcity has also hastened migration by youth, who have shifted base to cities to avoid the drudgery and hardships of life in a village without water. But officials of MJP, part of Water and Sanitation department, are confident the water woes of the region would be resolved by next year. MJP executive engineer incharge Deepak Mahajan said, \u201cThe Shahapada dam is the source of water here. But it has a capacity of only 1 million cubic metres and starts drying by November. So, we are looking at supply from Hetwane dam for villages like Shirki and Bori. A 21-kilometre pipeline network and a filtration plant is being created from Hetwane to Shahpada and the existing pipeline from Shahpada to these villages will be used to supply water. By next year the water problem in these villages should be resolved.\u201d For Shikri residents, once served notices for non-payment of water bills and taken to court by state departments, this is an outcome they are waiting for.

MMRDA\u2019s chief of transport and communication Vijaya Laxmi said they had taken a decision to discourage parking facilities at the upcoming metro stations to encourage people to use the mass transport over private transport. \u201cOnce we achieve a major share of public transport up to 75% in the city by 2031, then we can implement congestion charges in major areas or around the metro or railway stations,\u201d she said. A draft of the recommendations made at the conference will be submitted to the government soon, said Neville Mehta of Mumbai First. The NEERI director said, \u201cOther than cross-financing of congestion charges, there is a proposal to issue guideines for corporates in Mumbai in managing transport of their employees. There is a proposal to reward companies that manage the transport of employees in an eco-friendly and optimised manner.\u201d Also the conference insisted on promoting hybrid or electric vehicles besides ensuring maximum pedestrian areas to encourage present 1 km per pedestrian travel in the city to 2 km and beyond, Kumar told TOI soon after the concluding session of the conference. Overall, travel by public transport accounts for 54% of kms travelled in Mumbai while a major chunk is still attributed to private transport. This makes it necessary to to further improve overall quality, network reach and ease of access from feeder transport modes. MPCB chairman Sudhir Shrivastava indicated that maintaining control over vehicle growth and encouraging the use of public transport are their key objectives.

State forest officials, along with the wildlife crime control bureau, assisted the DRI in these raids. \u201cSeveral exotic bird species like sulphur-crested cockatoos, African and Burmese parrots, Galah cockatoos, love birds among others were seized by the raiding teams at Crawford Market in south Mumbai, Kurla, Govandi and Santacruz. This is one of the big seizures dealing with illegal trading of caged birds,\u201d said an official who was part of the raids. From Crawford Market alone, exotic bird species kept in 21cages were seized. Sources said that similar raids were held in other parts of the state, leading to several arrests as well by the DRI. Surprisingly, there was also a flamingo among the birds seized from one of the raids in suburban Mumbai, indicating that the traders could also have poached the wetland birds currently seen in large numbers along different coasts in and around Mumbai. \u201cSome other bird species noticed during the raids include various cockatiels, ducks among others, which fuels suspicion that exotic birds may also be bred in captivity in India and are then sold at high prices to eager buyers. Often, the birds are smuggled in by sea, air and also by road for this illegal business,\u201d said an official. City-based activists also pointed out that Indian bird species are protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and so their trading or poaching can lead to jail terms by the wildlife authorities. However, since exotic or foreign birds are not covered by the Wildlife Protection Act, many bird breeders and smugglers run this racket. \u201cIn India, we have drafted import-export policy and rules which prevent trade of exotic bird and animal species. But fascination for foreign breed birds, which may also be endangered species, leads to their smuggling and captivity and therefore this illegal trade,\u201d said an animal rights activist.
