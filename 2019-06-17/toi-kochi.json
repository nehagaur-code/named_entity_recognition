{"Kochi roads: Corporation sitting on restoration works": {"datetime": "", "description": "KOCHI: Lack of proper planning and coordination among various agencies have left many of the city roads in a dilapidated condition. Almost a dozen roads in various parts of the city, which were dug up for laying water pipes under drinking water project mooted under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) are yet to be restored, though the restoration charges were paid to the corporation almost a year ago. Now, the corporation authorities have floated tenders for the work. But, the relaying works could be started only after the monsoon is over. As a temporary measure, the corporation plans to fill the \u2018major potholes\u2019 on these roads. Still, there is apprehension regarding whether the local body can spend funds for temporary repair works. So, the authorities are exploring ways to spend funds without earning the wrath of the auditors. Subash Chandrabose Road\u201cMany of the councillors had demanded at the council meetings that roads should be restored well ahead of monsoon. But, the corporation authorities didn\u2019t act,\u201d said V P Chandran, secretary, LDF parliamentary party, Kochi Corporation. According to the corporation authorities, noncompletion of pipe-laying by Kerala Water Authority delayed the tender process. \u201cWe expect that tender process for relaying many of the city roads including a dozen of roads which are to be restored following pipelaying works of Amrut will be completed in a week. Now, the mayor has given instructions to the officials to carry out filling of potholes on roads which had been dug up for pipe laying,\u201d said P M Harris, chairperson, the standing committee for works, Kochi Corporation. \u201cRelaying works can\u2019t be done during rains. So, we will have to wait for the rain to subside,\u201d he said. Opposition councillors are of the view that the local body authorities should have completed the tender process in advance and finished the work before the onset of monsoon. \u201cThe KWA had started the pipelaying work months ago and they also paid the road restoration charges. Then, the corporation could have started the tender process last year itself. But, the corporation authorities said that they couldn\u2019t have gone for the tender process without knowing the exact length of the dug-up portions of the roads. Such details were available only after the KWA finished the pipelaying,\u201d said Rajiv Chandrasekharan, the councillor from Ponnurunni. \u201cIn such a case, the corporation authorities could have relaid the roads in a phased manner. The stretches where pipelaying works had been completed months ago should have been repaired immediately. Then, the current situation could have avoided,\u201d he said. At the same time, the restoration works on of a couple of roads have already been completed. \u201cRestoration of Konthuruthy Road has been completed. I exerted constant pressure on the officials so as to get the work done on time,\u201d said C K Peter, the councillor from Konthuruthy.

I don\u2019t know how to explain my pain right now. My daughter gave birth during the floods in 2018.

After the wedding, they went to Gujarat. His wife returned home in March 2018 after she became pregnant. He was transferred to Mumbai in June 2018.

Though he was the silent type, he was our leader. He always did the right thing. He cared for us when we sustained injuries during playtime and even took us to hospital.

Suju recalled the family\u2019s relocation to Chennai in 2012. \u201cMy father became the engineer at another seafood export company in Chennai.

According to Indira, \u201cAjas killed her after she turned down his marriage proposal. He had threatened to kill her and her husband many times. He had beaten her up with shoes. When I had offered to interfere, she said it might create more trouble. She had also informed Vallikunnam sub-inspector about the issue three months ago.\u201d However, Vallikunnam sub-inspector Shaiju Ebrahim said he was not informed. He added that Indira herself told him on Sunday that they did not inform police due to fear. He said Sowmya had borrowed Rs 1.25 lakh from Ajas. When she returned the money, Ajas did not accept it and demanded to marry him. She transferred the money to his account. But he sent it back to her account. Following this, Sowmya and Indira asked him to collect the money in person at KSRTC bus station, Ernakulam in May. Though he came to meet them, he refused to take the money back and dropped the duo at Clappana. When things started going out of hands, Sowmya blocked his number. But Ajas continued to stalk her from other numbers. Indira, too, had requested Ajas not to disturb her daughter, the officer said. Soumya had joined Kerala Police in 2014. She was trained under Ajas for around three months. They went on to become friends through social media, said her friends. Her husband was home a month ago on vacation. Apart from Rishikesh (Class VII), the couple has another son, Adhisesh (Class V) and a three-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Ridhika.

A division bench comprising chief justice Hrishikesh Roy and justice AK Jayasankaran Nambiar considered a petition (WP-C No. 16237/2019) filed by P Muraleedharan of Pandit Karuppan Road at Mattummal near Thevara in Kochi. At the hearing, the court said it has limitations in interfering with the policy decisions of the government and that it can do so only when such a decision is against public interest. It is seen that it is a matter that has been considered by various governments, the court noted. Responding to the petitioner\u2019s demand that a Commission of Inquiry should be appointed to identify areas with high crime rate, the court asked how it can ask the government to take a policy decision only after receiving the report of an enquiry commission. The court also asked the petitioner\u2019s counsel to explain where all in India were commissionerates established after conducting an enquiry by a Commission of Inquiry. As the petitioner\u2019s counsel was not able to provide a reply, the court said a petition should be filed only if adequate records and information are available. The court also warned that it would impose a fine on the petitioner for raising baseless arguments. Following the court\u2019s warning, the petitioner\u2019s counsel sought permission for withdrawing the plea and the court recorded the petition as dismissed as withdrawn. It was alleged in the petition that no serious study was conducted by the government prior to deciding for establishing commissionerates at Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram by granting magisterial powers to police commissioners. No serious study was conducted regarding the needs, location, and nature of crimes and where the commissionerates should be located, the petitioner had contended. Stating that main offences occur and the culprits in them escape through airports, railway stations, centres of interstate transport operations, and places with access by sea, the object of establishing a commissionerate can be achieved only by bringing more areas under it on the basis of occurrence of crimes, the petition had stated while seeking a probe by a Commission of Inquiry prior to establishing the commissionerates.

The damages are the handiwork of bandicoots. The local body should immediately stop dumping of waste near the approach road of the bridge,\u201d said an assistant engineer. The officer, however, said that the bridge is in good condition. Speaking about the broken and damaged slabs on footpath attached to the bridge, she said that they had decided to take an estimate required for the repair works. \u201cOnce we get the administrative sanction for repair works of the bridge, we will undertake it,\u201d she said. According to PWD, while it is their responsibility to maintain the road which falls within the limits of Cheranalloor panchayat (or Chittoor side), the Kochi corporation is bound to undertake repair works on the stretch of the road which falls within the limits of the local body. However, the PWD\u2019s directions have not gone down well with the local body. The corporation maintains that as the bridge belongs to PWD they would have to undertake the repair works. O P Sunil, who represents Vaduthala East division in the Kochi corporation council said the corporation wanted PWD to execute the repair work as the \u201cbridge is their asset\u201d. He said waste from three divisions of the local body gets dumped on the sides of the approach road. \u201cIt is a collection point. By 11 am the waste is segregated and sent to the waste dump at Brahmapuram,\u201d adding that the local body did not allow accumulation of waste on the sides of the approach road. However, a look around clearly indicates that garbage is being thrown around carelessly. Garbage, which includes plastic and other non-biodegradable waste, is heaped on the old bridge, which stands adjacent to the new Vaduthala -Chittoor bridge. Domestic animals like goats and cows can be seen feeding on the waste. Pungent smell, which emits from the waste dump engulfs the region.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

But while many went around romancing the first monsoon showers of the year and clicking selfies, some felt unwelcoming about the rains, and in fact were reduced to anxiety. Research student Sooraj H from Kochi was one such. He had been trapped in Kochi during the unprecedented floods of August and now he can barely look out of the window without feeling restless and breaking into palpitations. For the past two months, he has also been experiencing severe mood swings and sleeplessness and it had begun to affect his work and relationship. Sooraj, who now stays alone in the city, sought help from his friends and explained how his anxiety is affecting his life. \u201cI tried my best to stay calm, but I lost my control when the Orange Alert and low pressure at sea were announced. Also, the video that has been doing the rounds of the flooding at Fort Kochi beach, where I used to hang out, added to my stress,\u201d he says. He approached a psychologist. \u201cI feel much better now as I have understood what is happening to me.\u201d In 2018, Kerala saw its worst monsoon since 1924, as the state\u2019s 44 rivers ran wild, and left over 3.1 lakh homeless; 1,568 relief camps were opened, 432 people died, and several went missing. The Kerala government reported that one-sixth of the state\u2019s population were directly affected by the unexpected natural disaster, causing them mental and physical trauma. As the disaster-affected people in Kerala are trying hard to rebuild their lives, experts say that many are being silently eaten up by the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress reaction and acute mental exertion, called anniversary reaction, that could hit one around the time the natural disaster or trauma last struck. According to Dr Vivek Ullattil, a psychiatrist from Ernakulam, over the past two months, most of his cases are related to anxiety stemming from the floods. He points out, \u201cWith the start of the monsoon, their anxieties, which were suppressed for a year, are coming out. They are anxious about whether the dams be opened again and if there will be human loss.\u201d His cases, he says, can be categorised into those of people directly affected by the floods, those who have an anxious personality and always consider the worst-case scenario and thirdly, people who have a family history of anxiety disorder or depression. \u201cThe monsoon triggers their stress,\u201d he says. Dr Jaico Paulose, who was actively involved in the flood relief activities at Thiruvalla, explains that panic attacks and PTSD affect not just adults, but also children. \u201cThe shock is imprinted in children who tend to replay the moments when they had to leave their homes in a hurry due to the waterlogging. It is also very important to address the concerns of children who were trapped inside the house while the water level was rising, as they will be more stressed out.\u201d Pointing to some cases that came to his hospital at Thiruvalla, Jaico says it is essential for the public to have proper awareness on the mental health issues that one can have after being exposed to extreme life events. \u201cIn the event of a panic attack, one experiences intense anxiety and accompanied by a rapid heartbeat. So, they quickly head to the cardiologist. Most of the chest discomfort cases we see at our casualty are in fact, just those who suffer panic attacks, which can cause them to feel that they will die right the next moment,\u201d he explains. The levels of stress can be classified into mild, moderate and severe. Mild and moderate stress can be treated through non-pharmacological treatments. Vivek says, \u201cIf it is in mild form, one should try to divert their attention by listening to music or taking up an activity or hobby. But if you feel it is going to be difficult to control, you should seek help. Most of the time, minor attacks can be handled by a strong social support system. People who live alone and have no support base will be more prone to panic attacks, so create a strong support system. Everybody becomes anxious and panics in such a situation but when it is excessive and if you feel it is affecting how you live and function, you need to take help.\u201d If it is severe and is affecting their sleep, appetite, relationship and work, they must take counselling or medication. \u201cMany people who come to us feeling mentally disabled, then go on to lead successful lives after identifying their condition as a panic attack. Once they identify this, we teach them to live through the panic attack by prescribing them some relaxation exercises and so on,\u201d says Jaico. But doctors warn against ignoring the symptoms as it may cause major problems. Jaico adds, \u201cThose who have not taken help will avoid going out and prefer to stay inside, as they could be suffering from anticipatory anxiety. They will also confine to their safe zone which is called acrophobic disorder. Once it is cured, they will be free mentally and will be able to face life better.\u201d For children the trauma lingers. Their stress level depends on the reaction of the adults at home. \u201cSo, the cure can be done together,\u201d he says. Who is vulnerable to PTSD?1. Those who have been suffering from depression, anxiety disorder, panic disorder or even mood disorder 2. Those who have experienced trauma earlier 3. Those who are mentally vulnerable 4.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Hrishikesh Roy and Justice A K Jayasankaran Nambiar considered a petition filed by P Muraleedharan of Thevara in Kochi. At the hearing, the court said it has limitations in interfering with the policy decisions of the government and that it can do so only when such a decision is against public interest. It is seen that it is a matter that has been considered by various governments, the court noted. Responding to the petitioner\u2019s demand that a commission of inquiry should be appointed to identify areas with high crime rate, the court asked how it can ask the government to take a policy decision only after receiving the report of an inquiry commission. The court also asked the petitioner\u2019s counsel to explain where all in India were commissionerates established after conducting such an inquiry. As the counsel was not able to provide a reply, the court said a petition should be filed only if adequate records and information are available. The court also warned that it would impose a fine on the petitioner for raising baseless arguments. Following the court\u2019s warning, the petitioner\u2019s counsel sought permission for withdrawing the plea and the court recorded the petition as \u2018dismissed as withdrawn\u2019. It was alleged in the petition that no serious study was conducted by the government prior to deciding for establishing the commissionerates, granting magisterial powers to the police commissioners. No serious study was conducted regarding the needs, location, and nature of crimes and where the commissionerates should be located, the petitioner had contended.

Whitetopping can be done in various ways \u2014 from ultra-thin to thin and thick. Among them, ultra-thin whitetopping (UWT), in which a concrete overlay of 50mm to 100mm thickness with closely spaced joints is bonded to an existing bituminous pavement, is the most widely used. It consists of a thin layer of fibre-reinforced concrete placed over a clean, chipped surface of bituminous concrete pavement, to achieve full or partial bonding. Though the corporation and the PWD had experimented with the technology earlier, it has not been widely adopted. In 2016, PWD had whitetopped a five-and-a-half kilometre stretch of road between HMT Junction and Manalimukku. \u201cIt was also one of the major recommendations of the Kochi Road Conclave organized by the Kochi corporation in 2011,\u201d said Sohan. The conclave had recommended whitetopping of all existing roads under the corporation, developing designer roads and the use of bitumen macadam and bitumen concrete (BMBC) in roads with high traffic density. \u201cWhitetopping has been done successfully in several states across India including Gujarat. It is high time that we adopted it. It acts like waterproofing and can reduce damage due to seeping in of water during the rains,\u201d said Sohan. Whitetopping can uniformly fill pores in bituminous pavements more effectively and thus help reduce the occurrence of cracks. \u201cIt is also cost-effective,\u201d he said.

Soumya Pushpakaran, who was working at Vallikunnam police station, was murdered by N A Ajas, 33, a civil police officer attached to Aluva traffic police station, on Saturday afternoon as she was returning home after her day shift. Soumya was a mother of three, whose husband works in the Gulf. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the exact cause of the murder. Our information is that they first met at Kerala Police Academy. We have started a detailed probe led by two DySPs,\u2019\u2019 Alappuzha SP K M Tomy said. According to police, Soumya left Vallikunnam police station around 2.30pm after her duty with student police cadet members in a nearby school and had almost reached home at Thekkemuri on her twowheeler, when Ajas, who was waiting in a rented car, rammed her scooter and knocked her down. Seeing Ajas alight from the car, Soumya tried to flee but he attacked her with a sword. Soumya managed to run to a neighbour\u2019s house. Ajas chased her, poured petrol over her body and set her on fire using a cigarette lighter. Hearing Soumya\u2019s screams, local people rushed to the spot and apprehended Ajas. Soumya reportedly tried to resist Ajas as he set her ablaze, and the latter suffered above 40% burns. He has been admitted to ICU in Alappuzha Medical College Hospital. \u201cSoumya, a graduate, was selected to Kerala Police and joined the 11th batch of women civil police officers at Kerala Police Academy, Thrissur on June 16, 2014. She completed her training in March 2015. During the last session of training, the accused Ajas came as havildar for imparting training. He trained the team for around two to three months.

The stretch is prone to landslips, tree falls and flooding. On Friday, a landslip was reported from the fifth bend of the ghat road, the only link for the tribespeople of Attapadi to reach Palakkad. For the past two years, there were agitations, including hartals, demanding reconstruction of the 54-km stretch of the Mannarkkad-Mukkali high range road and Mukkali-Anaikatti Road. Public works department (PWD) had allotted Rs 80 crore for the reconstruction of the road two years ago. The Kisan Sabha convener M Sukumaran said that the road to Attapadi was in a bad condition for more than two years. \u201cThe high range road from Mannarkkad to Mukkali suffered damages in the heavy rain and landslides around 2.5 years ago. But the roads were not reconstructed despite PWD sanctioning Rs 80 crore in the state budget for the repairs,\u201d he said. Last year, traffic was suspended for weeks due to the poor condition of the road and people had to travel via Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu to reach Attapadi. Attapadi was isolated from the rest of the district for at least two months during the deluge in August last year. \u201cLackadaisical attitude of PWD in taking up the road has put the lives of tribespeople in hardship,\u201d said K A Ramu, convener of \u2018Thampu\u2019, a tribal organization. Tribespeople are facing the problem of road connectivity though huge amount of money is spent in Attapadi by both the Central and state governments for the welfare of tribal people. Thousands of vehicles using the Mannarkkad-Attapadi Road could be disastrous especially during the heavy rain when chances of landslips and flooding are high, he said. Though PWD authorities had promised an alternative road avoiding the hairpin bends and steep hills, no steps were taken to implement the project. The proposed alternate road will reduce the distance between Attapadi and the district headquarters by nearly 30km, Ramu added.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony.

Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life.

The entire city has been dug out in the guise of laying underground drainage scheme and left without repair. How shocking it is to see 30 people dying of diarrhoea in a city like Guntur? Is it not the failure of the state government? Opposition leader Jaganmohan Reddy is equally responsible for the tragedy as he never dared to question the government by going to the assembly,\u201d he said. He further said they would construct apartments exclusively for Muslims in the city. He appealed to people to support his candidates Chandrasekhar (Guntur West), Zia-Ur-Rehman (East) and MP candidate Bonaboina Srinivas Yadav in the elections, Pawan said they fielded a BC candidate Srinivasa Yadav whereas TDP and YSRC both have given tickets to their own communities.

While the average ridership per day in the Metro is 40,000, it goes up to 45,000 during weekends. The Metro has garnered Rs 150.24 crore in revenue in the last two years. A total of 45,000 people have Metro\u2019s Kochi 1 card; but only 26% of cardholders use the Metro daily. Kochi Metro officials said the extension work on the stretch between Maharaja\u2019s College ground and Thykoodam is set to be completed by August 2019. The state government is waiting to get the final approval from the central government to start extension work from JLN Stadium to Kakkanad. \u201cWe have got inprinciple approval from Centre in February for the Kaloor-Kakkanad stretch.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

There are more than 20 major bridges built across waterbodies in and around Kochi city bearing the entire load of traffic. Kochi, one of the cities with highest traffic density in the state, saw a growth of registered vehicles from 22,163 in 2009 to 31,111 in 2018. Apart from these vehicles registered in Ernakulam, vehicles from other districts as well as states pass through the commercial capital of Kerala every day. However, these bridges saw little maintenance over the years. S Shaheem, director incharge of National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (Natpac), said regular maintenance of bridges is mandatory to meet the pressure of increasing vehicular movement. \u201cThe public works department (PWD) is bound to ensure that contractors undertake periodical maintenance work without fail,\u201d he said. Shaheem said the department has the responsibility to include necessary clauses in the contract which facilitates maintenance works by a contractor for a specified period of time. V K Jayadevan, a former official in Kerala Engineering Research Institute, said bearings and road toppings need frequent upkeep. \u201cThe concrete mix used for road works should be tested during the construction to ensure that the bridge or the road meet its strength as per the design,\u201d he said. Officials with PWD said bridges are designed after taking into consideration \u201canticipated vehicle movement\u201d. An official with PWD quality control wing said bridges should stand at least for a minimum of 100 years. \u201cBridges have to be built as per the standards stated in Indian Road Congress (IRC). The bridges are to be designed only after assessing the intensity of vehiclular movement through the road where it is being planned to come up,\u201d she said. Officials in the design wing of PWD said bearings in bridges that see high vehicular movement will have to be replaced within 30 years. \u201cEarlier bridges were constructed under 70 R Loading. When heavy vehicles pass through these bridges, it jerks. In such cases, we install warning boards near the bridge. Now, we construct bridges following the guidelines of IRC,\u201d an official said. A former Natpac official said the contractor should construct the bridge linking the number of vehicles plying on it and the load the bridge has to bear. \u201cThe width of the bridge is decided based on the number of vehicles that will have to ply on it once the construction is completed. The super structure is constructed after studying the load the bridge has to carry. Wind force in the area should also be considered to ensure the strength of the bridge,\u201d said T Elangovan, former director of Natpac. PWD minister K Sudhakaran said the state government has conducted audit of bridges across the state. \u201cAfter the bridge at Enath in Pathanamthitta developed cracks, we conducted a study to assess the condition of bridges in the state. On the basis of the study, we categorised around 3,000 bridges into three: ones that need to be pulled down and reconstructed, to be repaired, and those are in good condition,\u201d Sudhakaran said. \u201cWe are reconstructing or repairing the bridges on a priority basis,\u201d he said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Jaya\u2019s Bonsai collection largely include Indian varieties of Ficus species as they are easier to grow in Kerala\u2019s tropical climate. \u201cThey easily adapt as they need less water and sunlight to grow.\u201d  Jaya\u2019s love for Bonsai first blossomed when she attended an exhibition at Kanakakunnu in the late 90s. \u201cBeing a Botany graduate, I was into plants and I was smitten by Bonsai and its greenery. I also got inspired by my friends, who are Bonsai lovers and that\u2019s how I started collecting my own plants. It\u2019s hard at first but we learn to be patient, just to see the plants grow,\u201d says Jaya, who also owns foreign plants such as Beggars Bowl, Baobab, candle tree and the ornamental plant Pony Tail palm.  While she says that Bonsai gardening can be expensive, she explains, \u201cWe could get a Bonsai from `500. One alone is enough if you love the plant. You could prune its small branches and create one by yourself in a pot. One can even grow the parasitic plants found in cracked walls or on big trees as a Bonsai plant. That way, we are also promoting green living. I would love to give the stems for free to those would love to make their own Bonsai plants.\u201d Growing Bonsai could also be a new mode to enhance greenery in urban buildings, she says. \u201cWe now have space constraints in apartments. So, growing even two Bonsai plants on the balcony is enough to start a green living.\u201d On the process of growing a Bonsai plant, she says, \u201cNurturing a Bonsai plant is similar to growing life size plants. It may take years to see the plant turn into a good Bonsai as it follows its natural lifecycle. The taproots are cut initially, and we nurture the surface roots of the tree species, which results in the miniature version of the plant.\u201d  A Bonsai plant must always be grown in one of the three triangular shapes \u2014 acute, obtuse and scalene, she says. \u201cAdd mud, sand and manure in equal proportions. For manure, one can use neem cake or diluted cow dung which would help them grow fast and healthy. Most importantly, keep in mind that Bonsai is not an indoor plant.\u201d Jaya, whose plan is to spread the Bonsai culture in the State, is excited about her life after retirement. \u201cI want to concentrate more on my Bonsai gardening and for the next six months, I will be occupied with them. I can guarantee that if you can grow a Bonsai plant, you will grow patient, develop perseverance and attain peace of mind. I had gone through a lot of professional as well as personal stress and what helped me keep a clear mind through all of that were my Bonsai plants. I would highly recommend this to the young generation, especially boys, as it will help them become tolerant, responsible and help them control their short temper that is often seen in most men nowadays.\u201d Photo courtesy: Satheeshan Karicheri In Video:A botanist and her bonsai gardenDownload The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Garbage dumped nearby Chinese fishing net.": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/garbagedumpednearbychinesefishingnet-/articleshow/69616202.cms", "description": ""}, "Arvind Kejriwal": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections-2019/delhi/news/rahul-gandhi-refused-to-forge-alliance-with-aap-for-ls-polls-kejriwal/articleshow/68664088.cms", "description": "VISAKHAPATNAM: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has refused to forge an alliance with the AAP for the Lok Sabha polls in the national capital.

Asked about Congress' Delhi unit president Sheila Dikshit's remarks that Kejriwal never approached her for an alliance, the chief minister said, \u201cWe have met Rahul Gandhi. Dikshit is not that important leader.\u201d Kejriwal has been urging the Congress to stitch an alliance in Delhi for the Lok Sabha polls to keep the BJP away from power. Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.
