Sources also said Ajoy Kumar could be fielded from the Jamshedpur West seat. A section of district Congress functionaries feels that if Ajoy refuses to contest from the seat, a leader from the minority community should be the Congress nominee. District Congress president Vijay Khan talking to TOI on Monday confirmed that a section of functionaries from the party\u2019s Jamshedpur West segment wants Ajoy to contest from the seat. Jamshedpur West seat has a sizeable Muslim population. It may be mentioned here that Jamshedpur Lok Sabha has six assembly segments \u2014 Jamshedpur West, Jamshedpur East, Jugsalai, Potka, Ghatshila and Baharagora. Sources said district Congress also decided that if there is no tie-up, Congress would contest on all seats. Interestingly, the former state minister and former Jamshedpur West MLA from Congress, Banna Gupta, a known face in the party, was absent from the meeting. Absence of Gupta led to a lot of speculation, as after the party\u2019s recent Lok Sabha poll debacle Gupta had questioned the leadership of state Congress head Ajoy Kumar. After this, district president Khan had sought disciplinary action against Gupta for questioning the leadership of Kumar in public. At the meeting, discussions were held on how to improve Congress\u2019s tally in the coming polls due at the end of the year.

Munda will do justice to the ministry,\" Hansdah said.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life.

It may be mentioned here that first MP (1957) from Jamshedpur seat was -- Monindro Kumar Ghosh from Indian National Congress -- a Bengali. People living in Jamshedpur (now in Jharkhand, erstwhile south Bihar) have lived in peace and harmony in this multi-lingual city, situated in a tribal belt without any problem.

Kakoli Mukherjee, a homemaker, said she hailed from Kolkata and was married in Jamshedpur and since then living here for last 50 years. She told TOI that she could never learn Hindi and always conversed with each and every Hindi-speaking people in Bangla. Never has she been discriminated on the grounds of her language.

Several Bengalis have help top post in this company, said Mandal adding that they have never been discriminated on the basis of the language they speak. Rather Bengalis have set flourishing cultural hubs in the city like The Milanee, The Bengal Club, Rabindra Bhavan which people from all sections of the society feel proud of, said Mandal.

His plea for anticipatory bail was pending with the Jharkhand high court for hearing, but as he is arrested now, we are moving the court of chief judicial magistrate for regular bail.\" He added that his client was arrested by Sakchi police on Saturday and put him in the Gagidih Central prison on Sunday. Jharkhand bans cow slaughter, eating or selling of beef. Hansdah, who teaches theatre on a contract basis at the Graduate School College for Women at Sakchi in Jamshedpur, posted on Facebook about his community's \"right\" to eat beef. His FB post on May 29, 2017 had also described how eating beef was a ritual in the Santhal custom. Later, a controversy erupted over his post and Jeetrai deleted it. However, the college took exception to his post and did not renew his job contract even after he tendered an apology. Meanwhile, a section of Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student outfit of BJP, staged demonstrations against him demanding an FIR and also pressed the college administration to remove him from the post. Asked why the arrest came so late, Sakchi police station in-charge, R K Singh said, \"He was absconding since the case was lodged in June that year and a court arrest warrant was pending against him.\" Police also claimed that they had raided Hansdah's house in Sundernagar for more than 10 times in the last one year but he was on the run. Hansdah, however, reportedly went out of the state to work in a private organisation after his former college didn't extended his service contract. He was in town to attend a tribal film award ceremony when police arrested him. Reacting to his arrest, ex-MLA and JMM's district president, Ramdas Soren, said: \"Tribals eat beef in several parts of the country and Hansdah has rightly said so on his Facebook page. What wrong has he done?\" District Congress leader Bijay Khan said: \"I am not aware of the specifics of the case of Hansdah but it's true that the Freedom of Expression has been under attack in the recent years.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Ranveer Singh: Reasons we love the actor": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/ranveer-singh-reasons-we-love-the-actor/photo-fans-swoon-over-ranveer-singhs-chivalrous-act-towards-hina-khan/photostory/67116401.cms", "description": ""}, "BJYM to send 1 lakh 'Jai Shri Ram' cards to Mamata Banerjee": {"time": "2019-06-05 12:04:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/bjym-to-send-1-lakh-jai-shri-ram-cards-to-mamata-banerjee/articleshow/69660450.cms", "description": "JAMSHEDPUR: The district unit of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of BJP, on Tuesday announced to send one lakh postcards with \"Jai Shri Ram\" written on them to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in protest against Banerjee recently reprimanding BJP workers who chanted slogans of Ram near her convoy last week . \"BJYM members from four assembly segments of Jugsalai, Potka, Jamshedpur (East) and Jamshedpur (West) will submit the postcards at the district office by June 10,\" BYJM's Jamshedpur president, Amarjeet Singh Raja, said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader.

Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

If one goes by the exit poll results, BJP is expected to get around eight to 10 seats, a figure which is less than the 2014 general elections. The state BJP unit is, however, not ready to go by these figures. BJP\u2019s election in-charge for Jharkhand Mangal Pandey said, \u201cwe will get 12 seats this time too.\u201d He added that JMM patriarch Shibu Soren will lose his hold on the high-profile Dumka seat. Soren has been elected from this reserved seat for a record eight terms. Pandey said BJP candidate Sunil Soren will win the Dumka seat by a good margin. Though he did not go into the details of the exact poll strategy, Pandey said a different poll plan had been adopted for the Dumka seat. Commenting on the Singhbhum seat, where BJP's state president Laxman Gilua is contesting against the mahagathbandhan\u2019s Congress Geeta Koda, Pandey said, \u201cour party's state chief will emerge victorious.\u201d He said ground-level workers of JMM are not happy that the seat was won by Congress. Apart from the Jaganathpur assembly seat, all the other five assembly segments under Singhbhum LS seat are with JMM. Pandey also claimed that former chief minister and BJP\u2019s Khunti candidtae Arjun Munda, will continue to keep the party's flag flying high as Kariya Munda did. Notably, Kariya had won Khunti seat first in 1977. Kariya, who held the portfolio of steel ministry in the Morarji Desai government, won the seat seven times. Pandey did not express his confidence over winning Rajmahal and Lohardaga seats. In 2014, Rajmahal seat was won by JMM's Vijay Kumar Hansdak. This time it is fight between BJP's Hemlal Murmu and Mahagathbandhan's common candidate from Congress Mandal Hansda. At Lohardaga seat sitting BJP MP Sudarshan Bhagat is fighting against Congress's Rameshwar Oraon. Bhagat had won this seat in 2009 LS polls too. Lalit Oraon of BJP had first snatched this reserved seat from traditionally believed to be Congress's in 1991 polls. Meanwhile, talking to TOI from Delhi, state Congress head Ajoy Kumar appeared to be sure that his party on its own would win four seats and Mahagathbandhan will emerge victorious in eight seats. Kumar said, \"our party will win Ranchi, Lohardaga, Khunti and Chaibasa seats.\" Asked about the margin of win, Kumar said it would be a comfortable win in all places. He expressed confidence that this time tally of Mahagathbandhan will be more than of NDA in state.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Whenever he got time, Sahis, a bright student as told by his teachers, helped his fellow villagers. To earn a living Sahis undertook odd jobs like working as helper in the farming sector, running a poultry farm, tuition teacher. As told by his fellow villagers Sahis an honest man who was always willing to help others in the time of distress. In 2009, Sahis came in contact with AJSU-P supremo Sudesh Mahato and later got enrolled in the party. In the same year Mahato gave him the ticket from Jugsalai reserved seat (which has voters from both rural and urban areas). In that election Sahis turned out to be a dark horse and defeated three-time JMM heavyweight MLA and then state minister Dulal Bhuiyan by a margin of more than 3,000 votes. Sahis under the banner of AJSU-P triumphed in the 2014 polls too. Sahis, short build up man, is a very powerful orator, as told by many of his fellow MLAs. Sahis, a strong follower of Swami Vivekanand's ideology, believes that he is not an MLA rather a \"sevak\" of his fellow villagers and others living in the Jugsalai constituency. Residents of his constituency say that Sahis was and is always approachable like their next door neighbour. He meets people at a garage in his Mango-based house. People with all kind of problem meet their MLA, knowing he would help him/her in all possible way. Sahis believes that education is the key to development, so puts all effort to ensure better education is available in the area. Sources said it was Sahis, who toiled hard to get affiliation for Patamda degree college. Development is always a top priority for this MLA and it was his efforts which bore fruit and now villagers in and around Patamda have proper roads, drinking water and health care. Notably, Sahis would fill in the quota of AJSU-P, which is an ally of the BJP with four MLAs in the Jharkhand assembly.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal.

Last year, the Centre had announced a new approach to rejuvenate nine key rivers in the country- Ganga, Yamuna, Bhramaputra, Krishna, Cauvery, Godavari, Mahanadi, Narmada and Tapi. However, none from this mineral rich state was included. At a meeting headed by Das at Project Bhavan, the CM pressed for the inclusion of the two rivers in the state. Jharkhand chief secretary DK Tiwari told reporters, \"We have requested the Niti Aayog team to include these two rivers with CAMPA so that they can be effectively rejuvenated. They have given us a positive assurance.\" Talking to TOI, chief minister's secretary Sunil Barnwal said Jharkhand contributes 8% to CAMPA funds annually. But the funds that are being utilised to conserve 9 river basins nationally aren't benefitting this state. \"Of the nine basins, only Mahanadi (river basin) work slightly benefits Jharkhand as barely 0.18% patch of the river touches Jharkhand via Kolhan through different tributaries. On the contrary, we have two crucial rivers - Damodar and Subarnarekha, which need urgent attention. So, we have apprised the team with our concerns,\" he said. Damodar originates near Padma in Hazaribagh district and flows through different parts of Jharkhand before entering Dishergarh in West Bengal. On the other hand, Subarnarekha originates near Piska Nagri in Ranchi and traverses through Seraikela-Kharsawan, East Singhbhum before crossing paths in two directions to enter Bengal and Odisha.

The two candidates RJD fielded in Jharkhand - Subhash Yadav from Chatra and Ghuran Ram from Palamu - lost miserably and could not even get second position. RJD state chief Gautam Sagar Rana said the BJP candidates won only due to Modi factor. \"People voted for BJP candidates in order to make Modi the PM again,\" he said. Rana further claimed that BJP's candidate in Chatra faced much resistance from people while he was campaigning but he is still winning. Similarly, in Koderma the BJP candidate who lost in the assembly election is in a comfortable position in the parliamentary polls. He added that absence of Lalu in campaign affected mobilisation of RJD's traditional votes in its favour in Bihar. Lalu has been sentenced in fodder scam cases and is undergoing treatment in the paying ward of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) under judicial custody. Though a late riser, Lalu woke up early on Thursday and watched the election results on TV. He was glued to it for full four hours even though the results must have been unexpected and tough for him.

His vital health parameters, including blood sugar and the blood pressure, were normal,\" said senior Rims doctor Dr D K Jha, who attended Lalu on Thursday. Jha said the overall health condition of Lalu was also fine adding that the sore on his body has also healed. He further said Lalu was mentally quite strong and is coping with his incarceration without getting restless. State RJD president Gautam Sagar Rana described the results as unexpected. \"We will have to sit and analyse the cause of our defeat. The absence of our leader Lalu Prasad adversely impacted the party's fortune in Jharkhand and Bihar,\" he said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Jharkhand: Congress, BJP workers clash in Chakradharpur post polls": {"time": "2019-05-26 18:40:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/jharkhand-congress-bjp-workers-clash-in-chakradharpur-post-elections/articleshow/69506202.cms", "description": "JAMSHEDPUR: Sporadic clashes broke out between Geeta Koda and BJP supporters at Chakradharpur in Jharkhand.

State BJP president Laxman Gilua while talking to TOI on Friday said: \"To speed up the development work both state and Centre have to work hand in hand,\" adding that with Modi government in the Centre, NDA should be in power in state too. He said need of the hour is a \"double engine\" government (meaning same party ruling in Centre and state) so that there are no speed breakers in the road of development. Gilua counting the achievements of the present NDA government-led by Raghubar Das said at present all round development is only possible as there is a \"double engine\" government here. Recounting his recent meeting in Delhi with party's national president Amit Shah, Gilua said all efforts would be made to get 65+ seats out of the 81 in the assembly polls. He said like the Lok Sabha polls every party functionary would be instructed to play an active role in the polls. He added that booth-level committees would strengthened so that party can improve its tally in every booth, which would result in better performance for the party. The meeting was attended by Jamshedpur MP Bidyut Baran Mahato, state poll incharge Mangal Pandey and several party big wigs. It may be mentioned here that BJP won 12 out of 14 Lok Sabha seats in state in the recent polls and simple arithmetic says party is ahead in 63 assembly seats, if elections are held now. In the last 2014 polls, BJP and its ally AJSU-P got 42 seats, just 1 more than simple majority in the House. Giula said going ahead with this calculation, BJP wants to improve its tally to 65+. This time party wants to get a two-third majority in the House. Talking about allying with other parties, Gilua said AJSU-P is an ally of NDA and this tie up would continue this time too. Commenting on JD(U), Gilua said: \"We are partners in neighbouring Bihar and Centre,\" adding that doors are always open for talks and before polls there is a possibility of joining hands too. Gilua did not want to open his cards on whether BJP would fight the state polls with Raghubar Das as chief minister face.

In the initial stage the ban saw the end of use of plastic bags in the state but as time elapsed, the bags somehow slithered into the market from the back door and are being used by shopkeepers again. To deal with this menace with an iron hand, Kolkhan commissioner Vijay Kumar Singh has instructed the DCs of East Singhbhum, Seraikela-Kharsawan, and West Singhbhum districts to come down heavily on those who do not follow the ban. He also instructed the DCs to organise special drives from May 25 to June 10 to ensure the proper implementation of the plastic ban. Instructions have been given that under the special drive plastic bags should be seized and those using it should be fined heavily. Day-to-day reports have to be filed by the district administration in this regard.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

DC Amit Kumar said, \"Along with the inspection of the buildings, mass awareness drive on fire safety measures will also be carried out.\" Convener of the Jamshedpur Abhivabvak Sangh that submitted a representation to the DC for a fire audit of the coaching centres said, \"The devastating fire mishap at a coaching centre in Surat that killed 20 students on May 24 was an eye opener. Hence, we thought it prudent to seek a fresh audit of the fire safety measures.\" Close to 150 coaching centres are running in the multi-storied commercial buildings in Sakchi, Bistupur, Golmuri, Sidhgora and Baridih among other places in the Steel City that provides coaching classes to the engineering, medical, railway, banking, state and central public service commission job aspirants, but barring a handful, majority of the centres lack fire safety measures. Prerna Classes, one of the leading preparatory institutes in Bistupur, has adhered to the fire safety measures, effectively. \"Along with installing fire sprinklers in each of the three floors, we have installed smoke detectors and have three separate emergency doors in each of the floor besides two ladders and rope for use in case of emergencies,\" said a Prerna Classes official, Shailash Kumar.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Dubey, who faced dissent within his constituency for his absence, received a pat from Singh. \u201cI failed to bring as much development in my constituency being a cabinet member like he (Dubey) did here as an MP,\u201d Singh said. Singh was on a whirlwind tour of Jharkhand on Tuesday as he held two rallies in Jamshedpur and Dhanbad to canvas for BJP candidates Laxman Gilua and Pashupati Nath Singh.

He stressed on Modi government\u2019s efforts to boost the manufacturing sector. \u201cWhen we came to the power in 2014, India was ranked ninth in manufacturing sector among the top 10 countries.
