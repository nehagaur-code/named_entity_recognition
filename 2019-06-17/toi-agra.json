According to police, Maanpal Singh, 35, allegedly engineered his wife, Rajni\u2019s drowning in river Ganga on Wednesday. Her body was left in the river and it was recovered by the divers on Thursday night. Police said the deceased\u2019s brother, Rajesh Singh, had lodged a complaint against his brother-in-law, Maanpal, on Thursday for allegedly killing his sister. Acting on Rajesh Singh\u2019s complaint, police immediately launched a search operation and engaged several divers for the purpose. The victim\u2019s brother said he had gone to his sister\u2019s house on Wednesday before taking a holy dip in the Ganga. Rajni told him about the tantric, Santdas Jharkhandi who hails from Bihar, and his offer of making her husband rich if she has sexual relation with him. Rajesh advised his brother-in-law to stay away from the tantrik and left the house. According to the deceased family members, the couple got married nine years ago. Rajni\u2019s husband, who owns an agricultural plot, started taking drugs after he came in contact with the tantrik. Police said the accused was a good swimmer and left his wife\u2019s body in the middle of the river so that no one could locate it. Talking to mediapersons, senior superintendent of police Akash Kulhary said both accused have been arrested within 24 hours of the incident. He said that the tantrik was a drug addict and he was earlier nabbed with 700 grams of heroin along with his associates by the Raya police in Mathura. Kulhary said Rajni\u2019s husband and the tantrik have confessed to the crime. A case has been registered under IPC sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 323 (voluntarily causes hurt) of IPC on the complaint filed by the deceased\u2019s brother.

Of these, in 25 cases, the NHRC (which is a statutory body) approved the payment of Rs 1,76,50,000 by the state governments concerned as compensation for violation of human rights in alleged fake encounters. According to the data shared by the NHRC, the most number of cases, at 57, were registered on the basis of complaints received from Andhra Pradesh. This was followed by 39 in Uttar Pradesh and 22 in Odisha. Such cases registered in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh were 13 and 10, respectively. Agra-based human rights activist Naresh Paras, who had sought this information under the RTI Act, said, \u201cThe NHRC, in its response to the query, mentioned that 99 registered cases out the total 211 are pending, and 112 have been disposed of. In 25 cases, NHRC ordered compensation to the victims of human rights violation. It must be noted that following lack of common awareness, complaints in very few such cases are made before the NHRC. The actually number of fake encounter cases would be much higher. For example, only one complaint of fake encounter each in Jammu & Kashmir and West Bengal was registered with the NHRC in the past four years. State governments have been lenient in cases of fake encounters by police. In UP, at least one alleged case of fake encounter by police surfaces every month.\u201d In January, officials of the United Nations had written to the Indian government with information about 15 cases of what could be extra-judicial killings by police in Uttar Pradesh. They have also taken note of 59 cases of possible fake encounters. In the past four years, the NHRC has ordered compensation of Rs 85 lakh in 13 cases of human rights violation in Manipur, Rs 30 lakh in four cases in Uttar Pradesh, Rs 21 lakh in two cases in Odisha, Rs 20 lakh in two cases in Chhattisgarh, Rs 5.5 lakh in one case from West Bengal. Also, Rs 5 lakh in one case each from Bihar, Haryana and Meghalaya. In the RTI response, the NHRC stated that it does not determine whether a complaint regarding fake encounter is true or false. The NHRC also said it is its job to check whether human rights violation has taken place or not. In case it has taken place, the commission has the authority to impose penalty, order departmental action or prosecution of official or officials found guilty.

This time, notices have been issued to 16 advertisement agencies. They have been asked to remove unipole hoardings placed at unapproved spots. Besides, the notice mention that agencies will have to pay double charges for using both sides of the unipole for advertisement. Some agencies have been hoodwinking the AMC by getting permission for a single unipole and using both sides to put up advertisements. Earlier, councilors had raised the matter with the civic body administration. According to senior AMC councilor Ravi Mathur, \u201cThe installation of unipoles following the develop-operate- and-transfer (DOT) model is largely taking place in violation of standard norms. Private advertisement agencies are causing revenue loss to the AMC. But civic body officials continue to remain lenient towards them. Only notices are being issued as a formality.\u201d AMC chief engineer AK Singh said, \u201cNotices have been issued to advertisement agencies for violation of norms in placing unipole hoardings. In case, the wrongly placed hoardings are not removed within 15 days, then strict action will be taken against the agencies. It has surfaced that some of the agencies are using both sides of the unipole by depositing charges for one-side advertisement. Such agencies will be identified and double charges will be recovered from them.\u201d The AMC administration had in a bid to curb installation of illegal hoardings in the city had allowed agencies to set up unipoles at 600 points across 100 wards of the city. The unipoles were planned to be positioned on road sides. But in violation of norms, the agencies placed them on road dividers. According to provisions of AMC adverstiment policy, there must be at least 250 to 300 meters distance between two unipoles. But around 60% unipoles in the city have not been set up as per the standard distance between them. In this regard, complaints had been received by the district administration and the state government. Earlier in February, AMC had issued notice to 24 agencies to remove unipole hoardings installed in violation of norms within 15 days. But no advertisement agency took the trouble to do so.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Owing to a lack of supply of raw water, water treatment plants were not able to work properly. In several localities, there was supply of foul smelling contaminated water. According to the Jal Sansthan officials, irrigation department authorities have been asked to increase water discharge from Gokul barrage in the river. Agra needs at least 1,800 cusec water per day from Gokul Barrage on Yamuna, but with increasing temperature and the subsequent demand for water, the water level has decreased. On an average, only 1,000 cusec water is being discharged in the river since the past two weeks. The average water requirement of Agra is 350 MLD. On Wednesday, it received all of 215 MLD: 90 MLD from Jeevani Mandi and 125 MLD from Sikandra, the other water works plant in Agra. For the past one week, the water level of Yamuna has not crossed 481 feet at the Jeevani Mandi water works station. According to Jal Sansthan officials, if the water level drops below 480 feet, the machines at Jeevani Mandi plant will stop working resulting in a major part of the city losing access to water supply.

The scheme was announced during the 2019 interim Union Budget on February 1. Taking cognizance of the complaints made by farmers, the state government has now directed the district administration to correct the clerical mistakes. A re-verification process will begin soon as part of clearing the first installment. Under the scheme, financial benefits of Rs 6,000 per year was declared for all small and marginal farmers having total cultivable holding of up to two hectares. The amount will be provided in three equal installments of Rs 2,000 each in a period of four months in the financial year. The benefit will be admissible for transfer with effect from December 1, 2018. To the benefit of the PM-Kisan scheme, farmers were required to make an online application. In Agra district, over 3 lakh applications were received on the PM-Kisan portal. The district administration after verification of the applications had forwarded details of 2,33,002 farmers eligible to be benefitted under the scheme to the central government. Out of these, 1,91,012farmers have received two installments of Rs 2,000 each while 41,990 farmers have not received the amount in their bank accounts. Farmers who have not received the monetary benefit are making rounds of the sub-division offices and agriculture department. District agriculture officer Rampravesh Verma said, \u201cDue to some clerical mistakes and discrepancies in details submitted by the applicants, around 21% of the farmers have not received benefits under the PM-Kisan scheme. Revenue clerks have been asked to conduct re-verification of such farmers and correct mistakes in their eligibility report. We will ensure each and every eligible farmer gets the benefit of the scheme\u201d. Major reasons restricting transfer of benefit under the PM-Kisan scheme include wrong Aadhaar card or bank account number and faults related to land record of farmers. In some cases, bank accounts of farmers have been non-functional for a long time. During the verification process, 65,000 applications were rejected while a large number of fake applications had surfaced. Fictitious applications under the names of Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath were also detected. Multiple online applications with same name and address were also identified and cancelled.

The missive has been sent by Chandrapal Singh, an MBA graduate, who had earlier decided to auction himself along with several youths in the village on Republic Day to raise money for supply of household water connections.

Besides the letter, Chandrapal, a resident of Nagla Maya in Hasayan block, has released a video in which he and his minor daughters appealed to PM Modi to address their complaint, or else at least give them permission to end their lives as they cannot drink excessive \u201csalty\u201d water anymore.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Under pressure from several quarters, including the seniors in the medical fraternity, the junior doctors in Kolkata held a four-hour general body meeting at NRS Hospital. The meeting appeared to split three ways. While a section of doctors agreed to have the meeting at Nabanna, another section stressed on Raj Bhavan as the venue, while the remaining stuck to their demand for NRS Hospital. Pressure further mounted on the striking doctors to find a solution to the standoff. At 3.30pm, a group of doctors announced their stand. \"We are hopeful that our CM will be considerate enough to solve the problems that the state is facing in the healthcare sector currently,\" they said in a statement while refusing to accept any question from the media. \"We leave the decision to choose the venue to the honourable CM, but it should accommodate representatives of all medical colleges of West Bengal in sufficient numbers,\" the statement read. They expressed willingness to join work, \"as early as possible in the best interest of the common people once our demands are addressed\".

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.
