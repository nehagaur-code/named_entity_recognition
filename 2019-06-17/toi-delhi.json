AAP could not win any of the seven parliamentary constituencies. It remained far behind Congress, while BJP won all seven seats by amassing a massive 56.5% vote share. Congress got 22.5% votes, while AAP managed to get only 18.1%. So far, 50 such meetings have taken place. A few of them have been chaired by Delhi convener Gopal Rai, MP Sanjay Singh, senior leaders Atishi Marlena, Raghav Chadha and Dilip Pandey. The focus is on figuring out the critical areas where the party needs to focus on to turn around the situation. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has asked party functionaries to work hard for the upcoming polls. A party functionary said senior leaders have been asked to address volunteer meetings in all assembly constituencies to strengthen the party\u2019s position. Atishi, who has addressed meetings in Kondli, Vishwas Nagar and other assembly segments in east Delhi, said: \u201cWe are a volunteer-driven party and after every election we sit with our volunteers to understand the results. We have tried to identify our weaknesses and discussed how our performance can be improved in the assembly polls.\u201d The party\u2019s performance in the Lok Sabha polls was far below expectations. AAP was at third position in 48 of the 70 assembly constituencies. In a bid to assuage the concerns of party workers, AAP leaders emphasised that the party didn\u2019t get much votes because it was a \u201cbig election\u201d between Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi prompting people to vote accordingly. People will vote for AAP in the \u201csmall election\u201d (assembly polls), they claimed. An AAP leader privy to the findings of the meetings claimed that the bad results in the parliamentary election have not taken a heavy toll on the enthusiasm of party workers. \u201cThe workers are not surprised by the outcome of Lok Sabha election. Functionaries at the assembly level shared that voters confided in them that they didn\u2019t vote for AAP in LS polls because it was a different election,\u201d the party leader added. He further claimed, quoting party functionaries, that during campaigning on the ground people told them, \u201cIss election mein maaf kar do, Dilli mein Kejriwal ko hi denge (Leave us during this election. For Delhi, we will vote for Kejriwal).\u201d The meetings are also being used as platforms to know public grievances so that the party can focus on critical issues. The outcome of the meetings has been kept confidential. The senior leaders will put up the conclusions drawn from these meetings before CM Kejriwal. The findings will shape the course of AAP\u2019s assembly election strategy.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

This was the first meeting of the planning body after the formation of a new government at the Centre. It was attended by chief ministers, lieutenant governors of Union territories, central ministers and senior government officials. Addressing the gathering, Kejriwal reiterated that Delhi should be given the status of a full-fledged state, which had been promised for several years but denied by successive central governments. This demand was one of the key planks of the Aam Aadmi Party in the Lok Sabha elections. During campaigns Kejriwal, his ministers and candidates consistently argued that Delhi\u2019s holistic development wasn\u2019t possible unless it became a full state. Not being a full state has led to wrangling over jurisdiction between the AAP government and the lieutenant governor. While AAP blamed the LG for delaying or scuppering many projects, the LG\u2019s office demanded procedural propriety. Under the current system, the elected government has jurisdiction over all subjects except the police, law and order and land, but the Supreme Court has ruled that control of the services department is in the hands of the LG, who is an appointee of the Union government. AAP reasons that as a full state it will have control over Delhi\u2019s land, enabling it to make several welfare decisions, from allotting land for schools and clinics to providing housing for the city\u2019s residents. It will also get control of the law enforcement agencies and will be able to establish an anti-corruption bureau introduce reforms in Delhi police. The state government can also fill departmental vacancies under the powers given to a full-fledged state, the party argued. Kejriwal also took up the issue of Delhi\u2019s share in central taxes, which has been static at Rs 325 crore for several years. \u201cAccording to the 14th Finance Commission, states get 42% share in central taxes, but Delhi gets a paltry Rs 325 crore,\u201d the CM said. The AAP government claims that Delhi\u2019s contribution to the Union government\u2019s tax pool has almost doubled from Rs 54,705 crore in 2008-09 to Rs 1,08,882 in 2016-17, but the grants it receives in lieu have remained stuck at Rs 325 crore. Water was another issue that Kejriwal focused on at the Niti Aayog meeting. He sought the Centre\u2019s cooperation in his government\u2019s mega project for the natural storage of water in the Yamuna floodplain. \u201cImportant studies, including by IIT Delhi, show that in case this is done, water storage during a single monsoon will be sufficient to end the water shortage in Delhi for two years,\u201d a statement quoted the CM as saying.

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has signed an agreement with a private technology company, Anduril Technologies private Ltd, to provide the new smart cards, which would automatically get recharged. The new electronically-rechargeable cards get automatically updated when the commuter taps it at the entry gate. The facility will initially be available on the new set of cards, but will subsequently be added to the existing ones too. According to estimates, about 16-17 lakh daily commuters use the cards.

DJB vice-chairman Dinesh Mohaniya said NOCs are not available for laying water pipelines in some unauthorised colonies, while it\u2019s not feasible to undertake work in the rest. \u201cLand-owning agencies give NOCs for laying water pipelines in any area. In these cases, they haven\u2019t. For example, Archeological Survey of India may not give NOC for laying pipelines if an authorised colony comes up on its land,\u201d he said. \u201cSome unauthorised colonies have come up in such a haphazard manner that the first house is 10 feet away from the second and the second is 20 feet away from the third. Because of this, it\u2019s not possible to lay water pipelines in such areas,\u201d Mohaniya added. In the absence of piped water supply, residents of unauthorised colonies rely on DJB and private tankers, and illegal borewells. Officials said NOCs for most of the colonies are awaited from the forest department. According to an audit report of AAP government\u2019s work done in 2018-19, NOCs are not available for 95 unauthorised colonies and work is not feasible in 36 others.

This will also allow parents to see what their children are doing inside the class. The first phase of the government\u2019s ambitious project to install CCTV cameras in all classrooms of its 1,100 schools will be completed by July. Delhi government had announced the project in the 2017-18 budget, but a delay in the tendering process resulted in its reintroduction in the 2018-19 budget. After a successful pilot run in one school, the project is now being implemented in a phased manner. The installation has been challenged in the Supreme Court on the ground that the move will put psychological pressure on the children. But \u201cthere was no stay on the project so we are moving forward with it\u201d, Binay Bhushan, director of the directorate of education, told TOI. In May, the court just sought a reply from the government. This scheme has often been opposed by teachers and educationists on the ground that it\u2019s a form of surveillance and won\u2019t help either the teachers or the students. According to Delhi government, the project will ensure safety and security in schools. The government has allocated Rs 600 crore (approx) for the installation and maintenance of the 1.2 lakh cameras. The access and control of the cameras in all classrooms, corridors and the rest of the school premises will be with the principal of each school. Each school will now get 150-200 cameras instead of the usual one-two at the main gate. The smartphone interface for the parents is still being developed. \u201cThe parents will be given access only to the classroom of their child through a password-protected system,\u201d said Bhushan.

On Friday, HC asked the university to return to the old eligibility criteria in these two courses and extend the registration process till June 22. Earlier, the last day for registration was June 14. Under the new criteria, the university had made inclusion of mathematics compulsory in the calculation of the best-of-four for BCom (Hons). Also, an applicant was required to have scored 50% or more in mathematics to be eligible. Till last year, even pass marks in the subject would have sufficed. The additional eligibility criteria was introduced for a host of other subjects. The new requirements included a minimum of 55% in English and Hindi for English (Hons) and Hindi (Hons), respectively. Till last year, there was no such requirement. Even for language courses, such as Persian, Urdu, Arabic (Hons) and BA programme, DU had introduced a rider of 40% in either Class X or XII in these subjects. \u201cThe admission committee has been told to look into all criteria that are going to disadvantage students. It\u2019s likely that the additional eligibility requirements may be done away in all cases,\u201d a senior university official, on condition of anonymity, said. Quashing the amendment, a bench of Justices Anu Malhotra and Talwant Singh had said, \u201cThere is no dispute that you (DU) have to be in tune with the times. Nothing prevents you from improving the education standards. No one is saying that your decision is not right, but your timing may not be right.\u201d DU can carry out any amendment in the eligibility criteria by giving a six-month notice before the admissions, it added. However, the changes relating to lowering of percentage deduction for change in streams from 2.5% to 1% will stay. The HC ruling has come as a shot in the arm for several students. Varun Jatav, who wanted to pursue Hindi (Hons), said: \u201cI had 54% marks in Hindi in my Class XII boards. Due to the new rules that were introduced, I was not able to fill up the form.\u201d Jatav, who hails from Haryana, said his best-of-four came to 85%. The changes effected by DU had come on the recommendation of committees in the respective departments. According to the rules, these suggestions have to be ratified by the standing committee and the academic as well as executive councils after which they are notified. But, generally, once the standing committee approves the changes, these are approved by the vice-chancellor. At the statutory body meetings, these changes are listed as reporting items. Hence, this year, even before the matter reached the court, the EC members had written to VC, asking him to withdraw these criteria, as they did not have appropriate approvals. Now, as the university is taking a relook at these changes, the admission schedule has gone haywire \u2014 right from releasing cutoffs to the trial schedule for sports and extra-curricular activities. St Stephen\u2019s College has also extended its dates and the cut-off for interviews will now be released on June 24.

A senior north corporation official said a sensitisation meeting with local traders was held on Friday with the focus on identifying locations where the additional vehicle parking load could be shifted. The corporation plans to conduct a detailed survey of the area before implementing the project. The survey is aimed at understanding the ground situation, such as the available parking space, tentative number of vehicles parked on the roads, street parking available, the kind and amount of encroachments, the number of roads to be pedestrianised and arrangements that could be made for animal-powered vehicles, the official said. The move comes after the corporation successfully pedestrianised Ajmal Khan Road in Karol Bagh and regularised parking and traffic movement there. It also hiked on-street parking rates to discourage private cars and is currently carrying out work for improving the parking condition on connecting roads. \u201cSince the nature of Sadar Bazar market is different from Karol Bagh, we need to understand the ground situation before preparing any plan. We may need to shift unauthorised vending from the area, but everything will be done after a consensus with the market associations and shopkeepers,\u201d the official said. But the marking and lane division on the 600m stretch \u2014 from Sadar Thana to Bara Tooti Chowk \u2014 will be carried out on similar lines and traffic restrictions are expected to be in place for a month and a half. So far, the civic body has identified two locations as alternative parking space. \u201cWe can use the nearby Idgah area that used to house the slaughterhouse earlier. It can cater to around 700 vehicles. We also have the option of using a plot of the old zonal municipal corporation office, which can accommodate another 80 vehicles,\u201d he said. At its house meeting last month, the civic agency had approved a \u201cmanagement plan\u201d for busy markets, such as Sadar Bazar and Kamla Nagar, which entailed decongesting these shopping hubs and increasing on-street parking charges. The project for decongestion and pedestrainising Sadar Bazar was taken up on the request of the market association there. Devraj Baweja, general secretary of Confederation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association, said haphazard parking and traffic jams were major problems. \u201cA decongestion plan on the lines of Karol Bagh is required in the area. The civic body should provide ample off-street parking before restricting roadside parking,\u201d he said. The market remains one of the most congested in the city. The corporation official said: \u201cWe have observed that pedestrianisation of Ajmal Khan Road has had a positive impact on traffic circulation as well the air quality. We have got positive response from the market association here.\u201d As a part of the project, the street will be marked with yellow and white stripes, demarcating space for hawkers and non-mortised vehicles. There will also be a provision for street furniture like benches and greenery.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

The 28-year-old victim, Chandan Kumar Jha, was held hostage in a room in Noida and forced to call his family members to transfer Rs 2 lakh to his account, which the killer withdrew from different ATMs across Noida. Nearly, a month after this incident, the accused, Ankit, was arrested from east Delhi\u2019s Jagatpuri. Jha\u2019s family alleged that they had informed the cops at Shakarpur police station about the abduction on May 17, while the case was registered the next day. By the time the family learnt about his murder, Noida police had already cremated Jha\u2019s body as it had remained unclaimed for over 72 hours. \u201cWe expected Delhi Police to act sincerely and help us recover the body. But when they got to know where the body was kept, it had already been cremated,\u201d said Hari Om, Jha\u2019s brother-in-law. On May 15, Ankit had called Jha to join him for a party in Noida. He then took him to an apartment that was rented by his friend Shyam. There, Ankit and Shyam forcefully locked up Jha in a room. The accused then called up Hari Om from Jha\u2019s phone and asked him to transfer money into his account. Jha was then forced to reveal his ATM\u2019s PIN to Ankit, who withdrew the money from different ATMs. Later that day, when Jha threatened to inform police once the accused let him go, the men decided to kill him. They took Jha to a secluded place near Greater Noida and strangled him. The body was dumped in a canal after which Ankit drove his car to a place near Ghaziabad and parked it at the road side. Jha\u2019s body was recovered four days later and cremated after three days. Earlier this month, Delhi Police got in touch with their counterparts in Noida, learnt about Jha\u2019s death and informed the family. They were asked to identify the deceased from the clothes he was wearing. The car, too, was recovered a few days later. According to DCP (East) Jasmeet Singh, when Ankit was questioned regarding the cab, he gave contradicting answers and claimed to have dropped Jha near a petrol pump. \u201cWhile scrubbing through Ankit\u2019s phone, we found his photos clicked on the day of the incident. His attire matched with the footage from the ATMs and when confronted, he confessed,\u201d Singh said. A search is on to nab Shyam. During interrogation, Ankit said he presumed that Jha had a lot of money and decided to abduct him so that he could ask for a ransom of Rs 5 lakh. The family said that Jha had been pursuing CA coaching classes for the past five years. He had bought the car on finance and hired Ankit to drive it as a taxi so that he could earn enough money to pay for his tuitions.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

Kumar was also addicted to gambling and would often thrash her for refusing to serve food to his friends. So, she decided to eliminate him and gave money to her lover, Shivam (21), to arrange the murder. DCP (New Delhi) Madhur Verma said that during investigation the role of Anju came under scanner since witnesses had reported that just before the murder they saw two masked men near the house.

It was also found that Anju was in touch with someone in Meerut and spoke to the person for a long time during the day. \u201cSeveral friends and family members were interrogated and multiple teams were formed to conduct simultaneous raids at all possible locations of Shivam, who was finally found in Burari at a relative\u2019s house,\u201d said Verma.

The gang has been taking money from people by promising to install telecom towers on their property for a good rental income.

The civic body has the option to carry out biomining, or the extraction of certain materials from the dumped garbage, to turn the site into a park. Ahmed cited the Millennium Park near Sarai Kale Khan and the spot near Indraprastha Depot that were earlier landfills as examples of a turnaround. SDMC had consulted Sri Ram Institute of Industrial Research to analyse the area after the stabilisation process started, and its report said that the organic compounds had more or less decomposed and what remained was akin to soil. \u201cIt consists of 93.7% sand, earth, bricks, concrete, etc, and 1.97% of organic material, 3.77% plastic and 0.5% glass/metals,\u201d the report said.

The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

He initially liked watching funny videos posted by other users and soon the addiction prompted him to upload his own content. Nagar started gathering followers and six months down the line became a famous personality on the video-sharing app, which resulted in him earning money too. As his popularity grew, so did the demand to upload more content. Nagar, who works in the call centre of a popular restaurant, needed a new phone for this, but didn\u2019t have the required funds. Instead of saving money, the youth came up with a trick. He searched for the phone he wanted on websites selling second-hand goods. He created a profile, chose a phone and contacted the seller. On June 12, the seller, Jatin Chhabra, came with his iPhone to meet Nagar at the mutually decided meeting point near Preet Vihar. However, instead of making the payment, Nagar snatched the phone from Chhabra and sped away on his motorcycle. A case was subsequently registered at Preet Vihar police station. DCP (east) Jasmeet Singh said that information about the snatching was relayed to all units. On Saturday, Nagar was spotted on Vikas Marg on his KTM bike, chased and nabbed by the cops. The snatched mobile phone was recovered from him. During interrogation, he told police that he was in need of an iPhone to make better videos, so he decided to snatch one.

However, Delhi Development Authority officials said that it was a mistake on the part of the contractor and the concrete around the trees will be removed. Verhaen Khanna, founder of New Delhi Nature Society, in an email to forest department officials and environment minister Imran Hussain, alleged, \u201cFertile soil is being cemented to make an outdoor gym. Please note that all other outdoor gyms in Delhi do not have a cemented ground.\u201d Sanjay Van is a city forest near Vasant Kunj and Mehrauli in south Delhi spread over 783 acres. \u201cToday I found new cementing work around the trees, which used to have soil and grassy area, inside Sanjay Van near Qutub Institutional Area gate. You are requested to urgently stop the illegal work, give directions for corrective measures to ensure only soil remains within one metre of the affected trees. Kindly follow the procedure under Section 8 of Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994,\u201d Khanna stated in the email. National Green Tribunal in its order dated April 23, 2013, said: \u201cThey (authorities) shall ensure that the concrete surrounding the trees within one metre is removed forthwith\u2026 due precaution is taken in future so that no concrete or construction or repairing work is done at least within one metre radius of the trunk of trees.\u201d Poonam Dewan, DDA additional commissioner (landscape), told TOI: \u201cNormally, directions are given that no concretisation will be done around trees. We will get the concrete around the trees removed in a day or two. We will put rubber on the equipment of the outdoor gym so that people don\u2019t get hurt. We will ensure no tree is trapped in concrete.\u201d Concretisation up to the trunk of trees on footpaths make their foundations weak as there is no space for them to absorb air and water. The roots of trees are destroyed because they get little space to grow and anchor the tree. Interestingly, Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, also had provisions for penal action against those who trap trees in concrete. In 2000, the central government issued rules for de-choking of trees, which states that an area of 6x6 feet around each tree should be left vacant while concretising pavements. In 2007, Delhi high court, while hearing a petition filed by NGO Kalpvriksha, directed the authorities to free the trees in the city of concrete. Two years later, the court, while hearing a petition filed by SC Jain, ordered a survey in Delhi on the status and plans for de-concretisation.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

This has come into renewed focus after a spate of gang wars in the capital. Jitender Gogi is one such dreaded gangster who continues to evade the cops, as are Vikas Lagarpuria, Sandeep Dhillu, Amit Guliya, Hashim Baba and Anil Ganja who are giving sleepless nights to Delhi Police. Many of these names are suspected to be behind numerous recent cases of gang war, carjacking and extortion. Murder, attempt to murder and extortion are among the 16 cases that Lagarpuria has against his name. He was arrested in 2015 and was in Bhondsi jail till December last year. Police officers said he applied for parole, citing the ill-health of a family member but, once out, he never went back. His close aide, Anil Ganja, also gave cops the slip after coming out on parole. It is suspected that the two are recruiting new members to their gang. Ganja, too, has six cases registered against him. After Lagarpuria was arrested, Ganja started his own gang, but is learnt to have joined hands with him again. Police sources said there had been a spike in carjacking incidents in and around Dwarka and Najafgarh ever since the two men came out of jail. Cops are also on the lookout for Amit Guliya, a close aide of gangster Kapil Sangwan, alias Nandu. A native of Ladpur village near Kanjhawala, Gulia had a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head and was arrested in 2016 by Gurgaon police. He has been absconding ever since he jumped parole last year. He is said to be running the Nandu gang in outer Delhi and Haryana now. Police officers said with the division in the Manjeet Mahal gang and the death of gangster Vikas Dalal, the Nandu gang was trying to increase its influence. The gang was behind the murder of TikTok influencer Mohit Mor in Najafgarh. In trans-Yamuna, multiple police teams are on the hunt for gangster Hashim Baba, who jumped parole in 2016. He has been involved in a bitter gang war with rival Chhenu Pehelwan. Gangster Sandeep, alias Dhillu, who made a sensational escape last year after his aides threw chilli powder in the eyes of policemen who had taken him to LNJP hospital, is still at large with a reward of Rs 2 lakh on his head.

But of course, the latter is the privilege of only a few. In Delhi University alone, of the 65,000 that it will admit this year for undergraduate studies, over half of them outstation aspirants, only 4,331 will get hostel seats. This is true also of the other universities and institutions in the city. Traditionally, paying guest hubs have met the accommodation needs of so many students. These days, however, it is not just a roof over the head that students demand. PGs are a necessity, of course, but potential dwellers also consider factors like safety in the locality, CCTVs, fire safety of the building and distance from their institutions in addition to rent, food and cleanliness. Secondary facilities sought include laundry, housekeeping services and WiFi connectivity. That is why many companies have corporatised student accommodation \u2014 and they are doing well too. In the south, the major PG areas are in Lajpat Nagar, Greater Kailash and Anand, while Vijay Nagar, Mukherjee Nagar and Guru Teg Bahadur Nagar in north Delhi have been the traditional posts for outstation students. The PG business has grown substantially in the past five years. Local property owners and dealers have taken full advantage of the shortage of accommodation in college campuses, and the outstation students find it comforting to find so many options available. Start-ups in the business prove how lucrative putting a roof over students\u2019 heads can be. Companies like CoHo, Stanza Living and Students Inn, among others, are drawing students with their \u201cconsumer-centric\u201d approach. Backed by sponsors such as the Matrix Partners, Accel Partners, Alteria Capital, they provide more than just a room-and-three-meals package. Gaming rooms with pool tables and gyms are among the additional facilities they offer. \u201cI enjoy my stay here,\u201d testified Anish Goyal, 23, who has opted for Stanza Living in Shakti Nagar in north Delhi while preparing for the judicial services exam. \u201cI have access to a gym, TV and a fusball table, among other things. I don\u2019t study all day long and these things help me relax.\u201d Even those in the older mould offer more than just the regular room and board. Sushila Rani has thrown in free WiFi for girls at her facility in Lajpat Nagar, charging them Rs 15,000-17,000 overall per month. \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to take good care of the girls living with us and we ensure facilities that satisfy them,\u201d said Rani. Priya Yadav, who lodges in the South Delhi Polytechnic for Women in the same locality, conceded, \u201cThe PG experience has been good. Our landlords have even provided us with coolers for the summer months.\u201d Madhu Sanhotra, warden of Divine Shelter in Vijay Nagar, claimed, \u201cThe girls have always felt safe and secure like they would at home. We have a security guard present at all times.\u201d Another facility there, North Campus Girls PG, not only has WiFi but also a doctor on call at reasonable rents ranging from Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000. The sealing drive has caused a small dent in the business, mainly because coaching institutions operating out of unauthorised buildings have closed shop. \u201cFewer students have turned up seeking accommodation this year. We have definitely faced losses in the past year,\u201d claimed a cafe owner in GTB Nagar, who offers rooms to students. Places like GTB Nagar and Kamla Nagar have been hit. In south Delhi, the regular PGs have also suffered, but for another reason. \u201cNew PGs have come up in Zamrudpur and Greater Kailash, closer to the institutions or to Delhi Metro stations.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Students admitted under the sports quota often prefer these colleges for the support they get there, and it is these institutions that are producing the sportspeople representing the country and university in international events like Asian Games and University Summer Olympics. Anil Kumar Kalkal, director of the Delhi University Sports Council, explained that centralised trials for admissions, started in 2016, allowed the students to keep their options open on where they wanted to study. \u201cEarlier, they competed in the trials in North Campus colleges, but found it impossible to reach the off-campus institutions the same day for the trials there,\u201d said Kalkal. \u201cThat is why fewer students were admitted under the sports quota in these colleges. The centralised system has allowed the students to attend just one trial and get admitted to any college of their choice.\u201d In any case, reasoned Pawan Dabas, physical education teacher at Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences, studying outside of North Campus or South Campus isn\u2019t an ignominy any more. He said that the off-campus colleges were no longer disadvantaged because the facilities in all DU colleges had improved after NIRF and NAAC rankings began taking into account both academic and infrastructural facilities. \u201cWe have better infrastructure and provide the students facilities of international standards,\u201d claimed Anju Luthra, associate professor at Jesus and Mary College in Chanakyapuri. \u201cWe also try to make better resources available to them, including international coaching.\u201d Such care and support are what draws sportspeople to these institutions. Manoj Rathi, physical education teacher at Motilal Nehru evening and Delhi College of Arts and Commerce, also observed that good sportsperson were choosing outer colleges \u201cbecause they feel they will have less academic pressure in these institutions\u201d. He said, \u201cMany students choose these colleges so that they can focus on their sport.\u201d An example is his student, Shourya Pratap Rathee, a third year student in DCAC. The taekwondo champion from Rohtak, Haryana, said \u201cI was a science student in Class XII, but since I wanted to give more time to my sport, I opted for the BA Programme.\u201d His decision is paying off and he will represent DU in the World University Games in Italy in July. Nishant Sindhu, who won the gold at the 7th World University Shooting Championship in Kuala Lumpur in 2018, is one of the increasing number of students from off-campus colleges winning international laurels. The BSc 3rd year student told TOI that he joined Bhaskaracharya College because it was closer to his home in Gurgaon. \u201cThis saved me time in travel and I got more time for practise and study.\u201d Dabas, his physical education teacher in college, ensures that he gets the support of the college authorities and the adulation of the students to encourage the young shooter.

The matter came to light last month when a complaint was lodged by a whistleblower to senior officials at the airport who then started the probe. Meanwhile, a pseudonymous complaint was also emailed to the office of Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey informing him about the incident. The complainant, citing a brief detail of the case, requested the Revenue Secretary that the matter be looked into with utmost priority. The top officer in the revenue department was also requested to bring the culprit to justice to set an example for before other public servants, who the complaint described as \"wolves in the skin of sheep\". The copy of the complaint was then forwarded to the officer concerned in the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), the top policy making body for the customs department. Two superintendents of customs officials posted at the airport were then suspended by the authorities for their alleged involvement in the sexual assault, the officials said. Giving details of the case, they said that one of the accused official stopped the Uzbek woman upon her arrival from Tashkent on May 3, for checking of her baggage for any suspected smuggled goods. He then took her to a room, which has no CCTV camera, and spent about half an hour there without being accompanied by any women officer, they said. It is alleged that the Superintendent, who is in his early 50s, sexually assaulted the woman, who had come for treatment of her sister's child admitted at a private hospital in Delhi, the officials said. The woman had lodged a complaint with the customs authorities but retracted later after she is alleged to have been threatened of being fabricated in a false case of smuggling, besides threat to her life by the accused officer, they said. The customs authorities at the Delhi airport, who are tight-lipped about the entire incident, are still looking into the matter. However, it is not confirmed whether or not the customs department has approached Delhi Police, reporting the alleged crime. While enquiring into the allegations against the Superintendent, a role of another officer of the same-rank had come to the notice of the authorities. The duo were then suspended by the customs department pending a detailed probe. It is also alleged that the Uzbek woman, who can hardly speak English, is under tremendous strain and hesitant in reporting the assault in view of the alleged threats. \"The incident depicts a horrific picture. No one knows how many women may have been assaulted by such officers on the pretext of baggage search for any suspected smuggling,\" a woman staffer posted at the airport said on condition of anonymity. Customs officials randomly stop passengers to check their baggage or for personal search to foil any attempt of smuggling at the Delhi airport.
