The woman, hailing from Agartala in Tripura, was reportedly found hanging from the ceiling at her paying guest accommodation in the Bapuji Nagar area of Jadavpur a week ago. The accused, with whom the woman was reportedly very close, now works with a leading firm in Salt Lake. \u201cWe had received a complaint from the woman\u2019s mother who claimed that the accused had instigated and abetted her daughter to commit suicide. Prima facie, given the importance and seriousness of the complaint, we filed the FIR under IPC Section 306. We have begun a probe. It is too early to arrive at any conclusion on whether we need to arrest the accused,\u201d an officer from the Jadavpur police station said. According to the police, the woman was a third-year student of computer science at a private college in Salt Lake. On May 21, she had spoken to her mother around 1.45am and had asked her to call her up again around 4am so that she could prepare herself for her exams. Sources said it was around the same time that the girl spoke to the accused who had helped her in her initial days in college. In the morning, when her mother called her, there was no response. She informed the landlord who then broke open the door to find the victim hanging. The victim\u2019s father, a local municipality employee, said he had sent her daughter to Kolkata for her secure future. Sources said the woman didn\u2019t seem to be under stress when she last spoke to her mother hours before her death. Cops said they were depending on common friends of the two in order to complete the probe. \u201cWe shall speak to their friends to ascertain if the accused had a motive in abeting the woman\u2019s death. We are collecting all previous detail records between the two in this regard,\u201d said a senior investigating officer.

The Met office said flood-threat was looming large over the state and parts of the northeast where the Southwest monsoon has made a significant advancement in the last 24 hours. The India Meteorological Department's (IMD) Regional Meteorological Centre has warned that heavy rain is likely to occur at isolated places over Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on Saturday. Ahead of the arrival of the monsoon season, Friday's rainfall was of convective nature, said weathermen. \"It was moderate rainfall measuring 13 mm on the rain gauge in Guwahati.

The order was passed by the court in February this year but not implemented. While hearing the contempt petition on Tuesday, the bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Arindam Lodh, observed that their order of ensuring non-plying of converted paddle rickshaws was flouted by the administration as well as the state government. Hearing a Public Interest Litigation, the court had found that the converted manual rickshaws were the most risky modes of transportation. The manually regulated rickshaws have got high speed after they were converted resulting in a large number of accidents and even the death of a child last year. Since there is no safety mechanism in the rickshaw or not covered by insurance, the passengers have no protection. State advocate general Arun Bhowmik argued that about 10,000 such paddle rickshaws had been converted into motor driven ones and now the state government is faced with a challenge of livelihood issues. However, the state government has been working on an alternative plan. The court turned down the argument saying protection of life is more important than the livelihood of those rickshaw pullers who had illegally converted the paddle rickshaws. The court directed the district magistrate, West Tripura, SP West Tripura and SP Traffic besides, the municipal commissioner to swing into action to execute the order immediately. Otherwise, they will be held personally responsible for non-compliance. The court also found the Tripura Battery Operated Rickshaw Rule 2014 and 2019 was repugnant to the MV Act 1988 and cancelled it accordingly.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Later, when he moved the higher authorities in the police department complaining against the OC, SP (West) allegedly did not take any step to protect the rights of the complainant.

He also informed that a joint technical committee has been set up regarding the inland waterway navigability and hydraulics. Reviewing development projects, Deb has instructed his officials to hold elaborate discussions with the Inland Waterways Authority of India on reports of the Joint Technical Committee and expedite project implementation work. A survey has indicated that an 18-km-long stretch, of which 15 km falls in Bangladesh, needs to be dredged for inland water communication. The Centre has agreed to bear the expenditure for dredging work in the Gomati both in India and Bangladesh. Union minister of shipping and waterways Nitin Gadkari had cleared the pending project last year following persuasion from the chief minister. Officials also informed that a few other proposals regarding river bed management of some major rivers, streams and waterbodies of the state were also undertaken by the state government for checking flash floods and increasing navigability. Talking about augmenting milk production in the state, the chief minister said he has directed the animal resource development department to accelerate the distribution of 10,000 cows among 5,000 families in selected localities. He added that necessary funds have been earmarked for the project, which was supposed to be implemented by the first quarter of the year. At the meeting, the officials apprised the chief minister of 21,500 hectares of cropland being identified as 'high risk' zones where natural calamities cause huge losses to farmers every year. The state government has decided to insure crops under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana free of cost so that the farmers don't incur losses from the next season. Deb was further told that the forest department has introduced provisions of three separate passes to facilitate export of bamboo under Tripura Forest Transit Rules, after the latest improvisation in the Forest Act last year.

Justice Arindam Lodh issued the notice to EC on Saturday seeking its response by Monday. Datta had filed the writ on Thursday in HC on the direction of Supreme Court, where he had sought an intervention for fresh election in Tripura West on the grounds of large scale irregularities and manipulation of poll process in the first phase of polling on April 11. However, EC counsel Shaktimoy Chakraborty told the court that the poll panel would submit a \"counter reply\" to the original writ petition. The court granted the counsel's request and fixed Tuesday as the date for next hearing. The CPM candidate in his writ petition had sought fresh election in Tripura West claiming around 50% voters of the constituency could not cast their vote on April 11 due to large scale rigging, booth capturing and intimidation. The petition also mentioned that the returning officer, too, had filed adverse report on polling in 433 booths. The EC, however, in a meeting with a Congress delegation on Friday made it clear that there is no scope of holding fresh polls in Tripura West as special observer Vinod Zutshi had overruled the initial report of the returning officer citing irregularities in 433 booths. Five days after the polling, Tripura West returning officer Dr Sandeep M Mahatme in a report had stated that election process was vitiated in 433 out of 1,679 polling stations. He mentioned that many polling officials had reported irregularities in 65 booths while 368 booths did not have video footage of around nine hours. While reviewing the footage and reports of presiding officers and micro observers, the returning officer was convinced that polling officials had not reported the alleged malpractices during polling properly and accordingly FIRs were lodged against many of them and disciplinary proceedings were initiated. Based on Mahatme's report, Congress moved the EC and later the Supreme Court seeking fresh polling in Tripura West. The EC's decision to order repolling in 168 booths failed to satisfy both Congress and CPM. While the CPM candidate filed the writ in HC, Congress is waiting for SC hearing. The EC, meanwhile, has summoned a Congress delegation to New Delhi to hold talks on their demand for fresh poll.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

According to reports, as many as 55 counting agents of CPM were allegedly manhandled by workers of the ruling party in South Tripura, Sepahijala, West Tripura, Khowai, Dhalai and North Tripura and seven BJP cadres, who were attacked by workers of opposition parties, had to be hospitalized. BJP alleged that 12 party workers were beaten up by CPM cadres to create an environment of terror in the state. While a few houses and shops were set ablaze in Jirania and Teliamura in West Tripura, an 80-yr-old woman was attacked inside her house in the Karailong area, sources said. According to reports, IPFT supporters attacked BJP MLA from Golaghati Birendra Debbarma in the Jampuijala area and there were also incidents of bomb attacks on a number of houses in the Ramnagar area of Agartala and Lake Chowmuhani market in the heart of the city. While stones were pelted at the house of CPM state secretary Gautam Das in Ramnagar, bombs were hurled at the residences of CPM's Sadar subdivision committee secretary Subhashis Ganguly and veteran CPM worker Dipak Bhattacharjee. Sources said CPM's district committee office in Ambassa was forcibly closed and the leaders were asked to pay at least Rs 1 lkah each to save their lives and properties. Both CPM and Congress have threatened to launch an agitation if violence doesn't stop. The trauma centre of Agartala Govt Medical College (AGMC) treated at least 22 people on Thursday night. More than 17 road mishaps were reported in the state since Thursday afternoon when jubilant youths from the ruling party went into celebration mode. Police said security arrangements were enhanced before the counting began as per the direction of the ministry of home affairs (MHA). \"Surveillance in all the sensitive areas was increased besides normal patrolling,\" said a senior police official. He added that the nature of incidents indicate that the violence broke out because of personal enmity. Chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb have urged the people to maintain peace.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Last week, the Tripura high court had rejected Dhananjoy's anticipatory bail plea and sought a report from police explaining why \"marriage was not solemnised in a time-bound manner\". The public prosecutor had then told the court that the accused had been absconding and attempts to arrest him had failed.

The reelection will be held on May 12 in the sixth phase. A total of 1,679 booths had gone to the polls in the first phase and it is for the first time that repolling will be conducted in more than 10% booths in the state. The highest number of booths where repolling will be conducted are Agartala and Bishalgarh assembly segments, 18 each. \"On the basis of reports submitted by the CEO, the Special Observer, General Observers and the Returning Officer, and after taking all material circumstances into account, the Commission hereby declares ... that the poll taken on 11th April, 2019 (Thursday) at 168 polling stations ... to be void and appoints 12th May, 2019 (Sunday) as the date and fixes the hours 7am to 5pm for taking a fresh poll,\" the order issued by the chief electoral officer stated. Paramilitary forces from neighbouring states have reached the constituency and been put up in 12 government schools. This time, 1,41,251 voters will exercise their franchise. The EC has not, however, raised the campaign expense limit - consequently, parties that have spent Rs 70 lakh cannot spend any more. Congress and CPM were unhappy with the decision and demanded repolling to more booths. \"The EC has failed to maintain neutrality despite having serious proof about unlawful activities, including booth capturing, at the behest of the ruling dispensation. Moreover, the returning officer himself mentioned various discrepancies in 433 polling stations, including non-functioning web cameras in 368 booths,\" Tripura Pradesh Congress Committee vice-president Tapas Dey said. \"More than 1.5 lakh genuine voters, including 500 polling staff, could not exercise their franchise because of violence and manipulation of the electoral process,\" he added. CPM said there was no logical explanation for ordering repolling to just 168 booths, except an attempt to make BJP happy. \"Had the EC ordered fresh polls, its neutrality would not be questioned. People would feel that democracy prevails in India and independent bodies like the EC still work impartially. But now, that does not seem to be the case,\" senior CPM leader Pabitra Kar said. BJP, on the other hand, did not have any complaints. \"Whatever the EC has decided, it is BJP's duty to follow and participate in the democratic process,\" BJP spokesperson Ashok Sinha said. Then returning officer of Tripura West Sandeep Mahatme had sent a detailed report on irregularities and unlawful activities in 433 polling booths out of the total 1,679.

The Left Front has had an iron grip on the two Lok Sabha seats of the state since 1996. BJP, on the other hand, has never won a Lok Sabha seat in the state. This time, Times Now-VMR and India Today-Axis have both predicted a clean BJP sweep in Tripura. Last year, BJP had pushed Left into a state of near-oblivion in state politics - going from 0 to 36 in one shot in the election to the 60-member assembly. This time, after an election marked by repeated allegations of voter intimidation and manipulation by BJP, the results could be a re-run of the assembly poll verdict. CPM is biding its time, though. \"I have studied all exit poll predictions and final Lok Sabha election results since 2004. These figures are always skewed in favour of the ruling dispensation. This one is not any different. Every time, the difference has been about 60-70 seats in favour of the opposition,\" former CPM minister and senior party leader Pabitra Kar said, supplanting his argument by citing the disparity between the Australian pre-poll assessment that indicated a Labour victory and the actual Liberal party victory. \"Besides,\" he added, \"most groups are either managed by BJP leaders or funded by the party. We are confident Modi will not return at the Centre. BJP keeps saying 'Modi sarkar', not 'BJP sarkar'. It only shows how nervous they are about their lack of leadership.\" Congress, which has not won a Lok Sabha seat in the state since 1991, agreed with CPM. \"The exit poll did not reflect the true picture of people's mandate. There was a strong anti-Modi wave across the country. People have voted against BJP. But these exit polls seemed to be services provided to the ruling party, paid for. The exit poll has tried to gratify Team Modi shamelessly,\" spokesperson and vice-president of Congress's Tripura unit said. Congress, which drew a blank in the assembly election last year, has been consolidating its base again with a change of guard and fresh strategy. Going by the exit polls, the party does not seem to have covered much ground yet. BJP, meanwhile, placed its full faith in the exit polls, understandably. The war cry: \"Ab ki baar, teen sho paar.\" \"People voted for BJP blindly, considering the good work it has done for them over the past five years. We are confident BJP will emerge as the single largest party to form the government ... Other parties who are dreaming about forming a government have not even zeroed in on their prime ministerial candidate. We believe the people of the country are not fools and would not have voted for them,\" spokesperson of the party's Tripura unit, Nabendu Bhattacharjee, said.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood.

The last extremely severe cyclonic storm to develop and cross Odisha coast in May-June (pre-monsoon season) was the 1982 cyclone which crossed the coast between Paradip and Chandbali during midnight of June 3. IMD\u2019s summary report on Fani, shared with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), also mentioned about its effective alert dissemination mechanism which saw delivery of over 6 million SMS (short text messages) to the general public, disaster managers, farmers and fishermen in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal ahead of the landfall of Fani. The report showed that the country\u2019s national weather forecaster had, in fact, started tracking and predicting \u2018Fani\u2019 from April 18, 15 days ahead of its landfall. Its chart on \u2018landfall forecast errors\u2019 indicated how IMD reduced the margin of errors - both in predicting landfall point and landfall timing - in 2019 as compared to the long period average of 2014-18 period. Citing examples, the report noted that IMD\u2019s \u2018landfall time forecast error\u2019 for 24 hours\u2019 lead period for Fani reduced to 1.5 hours from 3 hours during 2014-18 period. Similarly, its \u2018landfall point forecast error\u2019 reduced to 11 km this year from 47 km during 2014-18 period, showing remarkable improvement after cyclone Phailin that hit Odisha in October, 2013. Its \u2018track forecast errors\u2019 and \u2018intensity forecast errors\u2019 have also been reduced substantially over the years. Referring to Fani\u2019s intensity which crossed the coast close to Puri with maximum wind speed of 175-185 kmph gusting to 205 kmph between 8-10 am on May 3, the report said it was the \u201cmost intense cyclone to cross Odisha coast after Phailin\u201d which had a maximum wind speed of 215 kmph. Fani had one of the longest track lengths of 3,030 km. In terms of intensity, Fani maintained the \u201ccyclonic storm intensity\u201d for almost 21 hours after landfall on May 3. About its monitoring, the report said, \u201cThe cyclone was monitored with the help of available satellite observations from INSAT 3D and 3DR, polar orbiting satellites, and available ships & buoy observations in the region.\u201d From May 1 onwards till May 4, the system was tracked gradually by IMD Doppler Weather Radars at Chennai, Machillipatnam, Visakhapatnam, Gopalpur, Paradeep, Kolkata and Agartala as it moved from south to north.

Gayaram Debbarma worked for few months with Bir Bikram in 1938 as his personal guard. But he had to leave the job following repeated persuasion of his parents. Distance between the village and the palace was about 40 km and in those days there was no means of communication. Gayaram could hardly meet his parents and sister after joining the service in the palace. \"I served the Maharaj for a brief period but had enjoyed royal food and facilities. I have attended the wedding ceremony of the prince, a life-time experience of royal treatment,\" Gayaram told Pradyot.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Jubilant cries of 'Ako Ebar Modi Sarkar' (Modi government once again) rent the air at the party headquarters in Guwahati and party offices across Assam as the saffron party bagged the maximum number of seats of the 14 Lok Sabha seats. Hundreds of party members jammed the Atal Bihari Vajpaye Bhawan, before counting started at 8 am. In 2014, BJP had scripted its success story in the northeast by winning seven out of the 14 seats. This time, the saffron party is set to win nine seats, including the minority-dominated Karimganj (SC) seat in the Barak valley. \"We were flooded with sweets. Nearly 25,000 people came to our office to celebrate,\" a BJP office assistant said. \"This is the victory of the people of Assam who have expressed their trust in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Our karyakartas (workers) toiled for months. The entire country is celebrating,\" said Assam BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass. \"With the victory comes responsibility. Our government in the state and at the Centre are committed to fulfilling the aspirations of the people, who experienced the fruits of development in the last five years,\" Dass said. Celebrations also marked the day at the party's northeast office at Uzanbazar. \"This is the day we all longed for. Even people who are not members of BJP rejoiced,\" said Naba Kumar Baishya, BJP's media co-convener. In Dibrugarh, as BJP candidate Rameswar Teli surged ahead, his supporters broke out into loud cheers. Ladoos and sweets were distributed. At the local BJP office in Amolapatty, jubilant party workers danced to drumbeats amid bursting of crackers. Similar scenes of euphoria were witnessed at the residence of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal at Lakhinagar. \"The celebrations have been on since morning. We knew BJP would win. The credit goes to the dynamic leadership of Narendra Modi,\" said youth leader Parag Dutta. In contrast, the Congress party office at Phoolbagan was deserted throughout the day. With the defeat of the Congress candidate Paban Singh Ghatowar becoming obvious after every round of counting, supporters started thinning out. The picture was different in the former Left bastion Tripura capital Agartala, where the city looked deserted in the morning. Shops were closed and attendance was thin in government offices. But the mood changed in the afternoon. Celebrations broke out. Chief minister Biplab Deb, his cabinet colleagues and party leaders congratulated the winners. BJP workers organised a series of rallies with Pratima Bhowmik in different locations of Tripura West and Rebati Tripura in Dhalai. \"This is the victory of the people of Tripura. They have extended support to Modiji for a better India,\" said Bhowmik. \"The BJP-IPFT government led by chief minister Deb worked hard and was able to infuse faith in the people.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

In addition, the CM has also sent DGP AK Shukla on long leave. According to sources, soon after assuming office as CM last year, Deb had expressed his displeasure over the administrative functioning of Tripura. Though he was born and raised in Tripura, Deb's career in politics was started in Delhi in a different set up. Deb was trained under RSS leaders like Gobindacharya. He had worked closely with top BJP leaders and several central ministers. But soon after he got involved in Tripura politics as BJP prachar pramukh in 2015, Biplab started facing problems due to the work culture and functioning of the party. Later, when he joined as BJP state president, Deb was able to sway the voters by his relentless efforts, which is unusual in Tripura politics. As soon as he took charge as CM, Deb served till midnight just to learn the administration. The security people in the civil secretariat and even his first principal secretary Lalit Kumar Gupta (CS who was removed) expressed their inability to work till late at night. \"He was desperately looking for officers who are habituated to his style of work. Deb started Janadarbar at the secretariat to dispose of cases of public grievances which was not accepted by many in the administration as time-bound action and reporting him back appeared to be problematic for them,\" said a close associate of the CM. The chief minister had suspended as many as 16 officers during his field visit in the last one year for their unsatisfactory performance, which made officials of the state cadre hostile. Taking advantage of the CM's displeasure, a section of bureaucrats poisoned him against Roy Barman and a group of senior officers, a source said.

Setting aside the plea of TPSC and view of the state government, high court bench of Justice Subhasish Talapatra while hearing the petition of an civil service aspirant Samudra Debbarma has directed TPSC to complete the recruitment by the next eight weeks. The court set aside the decision of the state primarily on the grounds that no amendment in the recruitment rule has been carried out by state government in last one year and the recruitment process was in an advanced stage. The government decision of cancellation of recruitment even after conducting the written test has jolted the civil service aspirants. However, TPSC argued that the recruitment process was cancelled by an order of the General Administration (Personnel & Training) Department on August 20, last year.

The notification issued by the chief secretary on Friday night reads, \"The governor, with the advice of chief minister, ceased Sudip Roy Barman to be a member of the council of ministers.\" His portfolios of health, drinking water and sanitation and IT will be looked after by the CM. Deputy CM Jishnu Dev Varma will look after science, technology and environment. With Roy Barman's exclusion, the size of the state cabinet has reduced to eight members. Differences between the CM and the heath minister first developed last year when Roy Barman convened a meeting of all block-level officers and executives of the city and towns on drinking water and sanitation without consulting the CM. Finally, at the instruction of Deb, his principal secretary and present chief secretary (in-charge) Kumar Alok had stopped field-level officers from attending the meeting at the eleventh hour by sending text messages. This further widened the rift. Roy Barman, however, accused Alok of misguiding the chief minister to create differences in the cabinet and had termed him as a 'black sheep' in the administration. The chief minister, on the other hand, reviewed the activities of the departments Roy Barman was looking after without inviting the minister concerned a number of times. Gradually, the interactions between Deb and the Roy Burman became very infrequent and formal.

The scavenger bird, which plays a vital role in cleaning up the environment, is suffering a decline in population due to a range of threats, including diclofenac poisoning and habitat destruction. Niraj Kumar Chanchal, the divisional forest officer (DFO) of Khowai, said 26 vultures were spotted at Kalyanpur area along the river bank and more than 10 at Chebri area. We are planning to build a restaurant for vultures in Kalyanpur and Chebri so that these birds do not run out of food. We would supply carcasses of animals at their resting and roosting places, Chanchal told PTI. A survey carried out by former chief wildlife warden Atul Gupta has shown that South Tripura and Sipahijala are the two other districts in the state, where the bird has been sighted in considerable numbers. \"Vultures are an important part of the eco-system. They maintain a balance between the living and the dead by devouring carcasses. Among the nine species of the birds sighted in the country, white-rumped vulture found in Tripura has been identified as critically endangered, Gupta said. Chanchal attributed the recent increase in numbers in Tripura to favourable habitat and non-use of diclofenac pills. \"Although India has banned manufacture of diclofenac tablets, a pain killer, for animals, the pills are being manufactured for human use. The farmers often illegally use these tables to treat cattle. Vultures, overdosed with diclofenac are unable to lay eggs. In Tripura, however, farmers and herders do not use the drug as it is a costly one, he added. The forest official also observed that big and solitary trees, along a waterbody, are ideal for 'roosting and resting' of the endangered species. \"We have seen vultures roosting on Shimul trees. So, we started a drive to plant as many Shimul trees as possible on the river banks,\" he said. The Bombay Nature History Society, in a report, said India once had a total vulture population of 20 million, which, by 2009, dipped to one per cent of the figure. Prasenjit Biswas, an ornithologist who authored The Last Flight of the Vulture, said human incursion and unavailability of food were the major reasons behind the decline in population. The Rudra Sagar Lake, its surroundings and the Sipahijala sanctuary, with its large lakes and forests, used to be a favourite haunt of the white-rumped vultures till the late eighties, he rued. \"Human corpses are rarely dumped in the open, while animal carcasses are safely disposed off. This has deprived the vultures of their livelihood,\" Biswas, who has been studying the movements and traits of vultures for over a decade, added.

Biodiversity conservation organization Aaranyak said monitoring of air quality by the Assam Pollution Control Board at Bamunimaidan in Guwahati has revealed the presence of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) well above the prescribed limit since 2008. Aaranyak said Guwahati's air is found to have very high content of black carbon. \"There must be a paradigm change in our public transport system and related policy to bring down the rapid growth of vehicles out on the roads by introducing a mass transit system that will also help in climate change mitigation. Introduction of clean fuel and discouraging prevalence of dirty fuels as a policy strategy will go a long way in curbing vehicular air pollution,\" said an Aaranyak official. Aaranyak has planned a series of awareness and action-based interventions for sensitizing people about the cause and effect of air pollution.

IPFT leaders, on the other hand, blamed BJP for the violence. Tripura lodged an FIR, stating that a group of IPFT workers stormed his house at Durgapur in Gandacherra between 11pm and midnight on Friday and tried to set it on fire. \"They also attempted to assault my family. I was away in Agartala, so I escaped,\" Tripura said, adding that the attackers did not say what had spurred this violent reaction. Rebati got in touch with the police here and the SP of Dhalai, who sent police forces to his home. The cops, however, took about 45 minutes to reach, by which time the criminals had left. \"Unfortunately, despite my repeated attempts to contact the SDPO of Gandacherra and other police officials stationed there, I could not reach them. Their mobiles were found to be switched off. I must say such dereliction of duty is not acceptable,\" Tripura said, adding that the matter was conveyed to the chief minister and other leaders of the party. According to reports, BJP supporters had taken out a victory rally in Gandacherra to celebrate Rabati's victory in the Lok Sabha elections. After a while, Rebati left for Agartala. The trouble began after he left the town. IPFT general secretary Mevar Kumar Jamatia, on the other hand, alleged that BJP workers from the victory rally had attacked the house of their party assistant general secretary and chairman of Ganganagar block, Jibanjoy Reang, and ransacked his house at night. However, Reang was able to escape. Later at night, the same group with two vehicles attacked the house of another leader, Prem Kumar Tripura, he added.

Election to Tripura West was held in the first phase on April 11. Following reports of violence and rising pressure from the opposition to conduct repolling, the Election Commission (EC) ordered re-election in 168 polling stations. The returning officer had, however, reported irregularities in 433 polling stations - an issue both CPM and Congress took to the Supreme Court, demanding an explanation for the low number of polling stations chosen for repolling. Datta had sought an urgent hearing of the matter, which the Supreme Court turned down. The vacation bench of Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Sanjeev Khanna asked him to file the case before the high court, which he did after withdrawing the petition from the Supreme Court. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, meanwhile, has filed a writ petition on behalf of the party, seeking the Supreme Court's intervention in ordering re-election in the disputed 433 polling stations. The petition will be heard in a day or two. The EC has invited the Congress to send a delegation to discuss the demand for fresh polls. \"If the discussion goes well, we will withdraw our petition,\" Pijush Kanti Biswas, vice-president of Congress's Tripura unit, said.

However, due to bad weather at other airports outside the region, some flights were cancelled. Flight services have been restored and flight movement is as per schedule. No cancellation was reported on Sunday,\" said an Airports Authority of India spokesperson. A total of 81 flights from Guwahati, Imphal, Agartala, Dibrugarh, Lilabari and Dimapur airports were cancelled due to rough weather caused by the impact of Fani. Air traffic has been badly disrupted at the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International (LGBI) Airport here since Friday as passengers remained stranded in the city airport for hours in hope to see the restoration of flight operations. Most of these cancelled flights were scheduled to connect the northeast airports with Kolkata. Though the Kolkata airport was open on Saturday morning, several airlines had to cancel the flights connecting Kolkata with the northeast, as flights operations did not resume full-fledged on Saturday. The AAI official, however, said flight operations between Guwahati and Kolkata started partially from late evening on Saturday. In view of the Met departments' advisory, nine Guwahati-bound flights and another 14 departing flights from the Guwahati airport were cancelled on Friday. On the other hand, Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) cancelled at least 20 south India-bound trains in the last three days considering the safety of passengers in the wake of cyclonic storm in Odisha. NFR chief public relations officer Pranav Jyoti Sharma said the tracks that were damaged in cyclone has fully been restored. \"All cancelled trains in the northeast will resume services from Monday,\" Sharma said. Sharma said that though there were some damages to maintenance facilities in Odisha, the trains originating from the northeast will not be affected as these trains are maintained at the facilities here itself. Many pilgrims from Assam who had gone to Puri had to avail special trains there to reach Howrah, and then board trains to reach the state as train services from the region to West Bengal remained unaffected during the cyclonic storm. A batch of 34 pilgrims already reached aboard the Kanchenjunga Express here on Sunday. These pilgrims - mostly from Baksa, Nalbari and Kamrup (rural) districts - had to leave Puri on special trains arranged by the East Coast Railway for Howrah on Thursday. Over 100 pilgrims remain stuck in Puri. The state government said pilgrims who could not leave Puri before Fani made landfall on Friday were safe. Most of these pilgrims were stuck in Puri after the Puri-Kamakhya Express, that was scheduled to leave on Saturday, was one of 20 trains that were cancelled. \"We are facilitating the returns of remaining pilgrims from Puri as early as possible with the resumption of train services,\" an official in the disaster management department said.
