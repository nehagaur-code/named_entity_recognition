The villages include Lohegaon, Mundhwa, Sadesatranali, Shivne, Uttamnagar, Ambegaon Khurd, Undri, Dhayri, Ambegaon Budruk, Phursungi and Uruli Devachi Despite a severe mosquito menace, health authorities of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) have yet to initiate measures to check the spread , many residents said. The landscape of these 11 merged villages which are already crumbling under poor infrastructure is dotted with half complete or ongoing construction sites where water stagnation is a fitting ground for mosquito breeding. All these villages have witnessed a significant growth in population and commercial activities in the last few years. However, water scarcity in these areas continues to be erratic prompting storage which also provides for the mosquitoes to breed. \u201cIt has been almost two years that 11 fringe areas and villages were merged with the PMC. However, people living here are completely neglected. Piling up of garbage, construction activities and water scarcity are the reasons for the mosquitoes,\u201d Shrirang Chavan, president of Haveli Taluka Nagarik Kruti Samiti, said. He is a resident of Dhayari which has been merged within the PMC limits along with Ambegaon Budruk. Medical expert Mahadeo Kodre, general practitioner and a resident of Keshavnagar, said, \u201cI have seen several cases of malaria and dengue from Keshavnagar and Mundhwa. People living along the Mula river in Kehavnagar, Mundhwa and Manjari are badly affected by mosquitoes owing to rampant growth of water hyacinth.\u201d The rampant growth of water hyacinth in the Mula and Mutha rivers is the reason for swarms of mosquitoes that invade housing societies posing a serious threat of mosquito-borne diseases. \u201cThe rampant growth of hyacinth in the Mula river is the cause for mosquito breeding. There are some problems with the Mundhwa jackwell. Since the desired water level is not maintained, water is not released into the canal in Sadesatra Nali area on Pune-Solapur Road for non-drinking and agricultural purposes. The stagnation of water has led to rampant hyacinth . We are in the process of clearing the hyacinth,\u201d public health expert Sanjeev Wavare said. Kalpana Nivare, a resident of Sadesatranali, said, \u201cThere is no respite from mosquitoes in the area. Children keep falling sick and mosquito repellents are of no use.\u201d Bhagwan Bhadale, a resident of Phursungi-Uruli Decachi, said, \u201c We are living under a constant fear of contracting dengue, malaria and chikungunya.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "time": "2019-06-17 04:51:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/swarms-of-mosquitoes-bring-sickness-to-fringes/articleshow/69817057.cms"}, "\nNaseeruddin Shah and Kamal Haasan at the opening ceremony of Film Preservation and Restoration Workshop 2016 in Pune\n": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Naseeruddin-Shah-and-Kamal-Haasan-at-the-opening-ceremony-of-Film-Preservation-and-Restoration-Workshop-2016-in-Pune/articleshow/51295088.cms", "description": "One of the highlights of the closing ceremony of the second edition of Film Preservation and Restoration Workshop 2016, organised by Film Heritage Foundation, was the discussions on the importance of conserving the country\u2019s movie legacy.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Even at ATM kiosks \u2014 some of which were guarded while a few were not \u2014 the security personnel did not have weapons to fend of criminals. The reason: No weapons were provided by the agencies that had employed them. Friday\u2019s robbery in Nashik, when an employee of Muthoot Finance was gunned down for raising an alarm, is a stark reminder of how vulnerable our financial institutions are. As an immediate reaction, the police there urged the banks to deploy armed guards, perhaps without realising that there are too many rules that prohibit such a deployment. \u201cEvery time there is an attack, the police tell the banks to strengthen the security measures, which we do by placing more cameras, increasing surveillance etc. However, even if we arm the guards, do you think that a single guard can take on six criminals, as was the case on Friday? The question that needs answering is: \u2018How did the dacoits get these weapons?\u2019,\u201d said a top security officer of a public sector bank. \u201cIt is the police\u2019s responsibility to act. It is unfair to put all the responsibilities on banks,\u201d he added. As per the latest data, Pune district has half its sanctioned strength of about 23,000 policemen. Moreover, a majority of the police personnel are not authorised to carry a weapon. \u201cWhen the policemen themselves do not carry weapons, how do you expect us to?\u201d asked Ashish Sharma, a private security guard deployed at a co-operative bank. \u201cThis is not a secure job,\u201d said Tikaram Gupta, another guard, on being asked if he felt threatened. Talking of how the guards are expected to deal with Nashik-type incidents, Gupta said, \u201cOur agency has asked us to step away from the scene if there is any untoward incident and report to the head office and the police. We are not supposed to get involved.\u201d Over a dozen security guards TOI spoke to said they often get half the wages that the banks pay to the agencies that employ them \u2014 hardly an incentive to put themselves in the harm\u2019s way. A manager of a financial institution said there has never been an armed guard at his branch. Once in a while, the police visit to check if the cameras are in order and we comply with the police suggestions if any, he added. \u201cThe problem in arming the guards is that the agency must first take a commercial arms licence. Some agencies have applied for the licences, but the approvals are pending for too long,\u201d said the security officer quoted above. Many agencies hire guards who have individual arms licences, but there are restrictions on where they can use the private weapons.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

BJP leaders in Bhandara-Gondia are heaving a sigh of relief as two of the four rebels, Khushal Bopche and Prakash Malgave, have withdrawn from the fray after hours of persuasion by them. However, Rajendra Patle is still in the fray. Virendra Jaiswal, who resigned from BJP before nominations, is not being considered rebel as he contests every time. BJP\u2019s Sunil Mendhe is pitted against Nana Panchbudhe of NCP here. Bopche\u2019s rebellion had created panic in the BJP camp as he is popular in the Pawar community and in general among OBCs. In Nagpur, Abdul Karim Patel and Ravikant Meshram, withdrew on Thursday, taking the total number to three. Pallavi Nandeshwar had withdrawn on Wednesday. In Ramtek, Sachin Shende, Gajanan Jambhulkar, Prakash Tembhurne, Ranjit Saphelkar and Lalit Shamkuwar have opted out of the race. In Yavatmal-Washim and Wardha, seven and two candidates respectively withdrew on the final day. One independent candidate withdrew his nomination in Gadchiroli-Chimur constituency on Thursday.

The proposal to allocate Rs79.30 lakh to the irrigation department for this task was approved by the civic standing committee on Wednesday. The dam on Pavana River, near Pavananagar, is a lifeline for the 22 lakh residents of Pimpri Chinchwad. The state irrigation department releases water from the dam, which is impounded at the Ravet bund and purified at Nigdi, to supply drinking water to the residents. However, the Pavana has been getting polluted downstream of the dam due to rapid urbanisation and industrialisation in the villages along and nearby the river. As a result, the civic body had prepared a plan to bring water directly from the Pavana dam through a pipeline so that it is not required to purify the water. The Union government had approved the PCMC\u2019s ambitious project to lay a 40-km pipeline from the Pavana dam to Nigdi under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) in 2009 and the work had started. Farmers from the villages in Maval taluka, however, opposed the project. They feared the PCMC would draw more water from the pipeline and a lesser volume of water would be released from dam into the river \u2014 which would also increase pollution. The work was then halted on state government\u2019s directives after three protesting farmers were killed in police firing at Baur on August 9, 2011. The BJP and Shiv Sena feel that the project must be implemented only after taking the Maval farmers into confidence. The BJP coming to power at the Centre, the state as well as the PCMC has revived hopes that the project will be restarted. The proposal states that a decision was taken at meetings chaired by the additional chief secretary on January 3 and February 4, 2019, that a detailed project report (DPR) for laying pipelines for irrigation and non-irrigation purposes for areas upstream of PCMC limits will be prepared by the irrigation department and the civic body will bear the expenditure. Social activist Maruti Bhapkar said, \u201cPimpri Chinchwad city must get water from the Pavana dam through the pipeline project without doing any injustice to the farmers of Maval taluka. The state government has taken a policy decision that water for drinking as well as irrigation purposes will be provided through pipelines. If the state government is planning to implement this policy and provide water to both the PCMC and the farmers, then we welcome the decision.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "SPPU launches liberal arts, blended science courses with global vision": {"datetime": "", "description": "PUNE: Liberal education and research have been the buzz words for a long time, confined to private universities. The winds are changing even in conventional educational spheres with Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) introducing two graduate programmes, one in liberal arts and one in blended science. While the BA Liberal Arts course will allow students choose from a wide range of majors and minors, the blended course is designed such that students study physics, chemistry, environmental science and earth science in the first year and then specialise in a subject which will lead to an undergraduate research thesis. This is comparable to the educational set up in Indian Institute of Science Education and Research with the only difference that IISERs offer a 4-year intensive BS-MS programme as against the university's BSc degree. Experts said the Pune university, with baby steps in new courses, especially by introducing the bachelor's courses for the first time, is steering in the right direction. The BA Liberal Arts course will be launched under vice chancellor Nitin Karmalkar\u2019s pet project Interdisciplinary School for Science (IDSS). This being the first liberal arts course by any state university in Maharashtra and is open to a standard XII passed student. \u201cWe have not kept any limitations as to students from what streams can or cannot apply. There will be an entrance examination and if the student qualifies it, then he or she will be eligible for admission. The course has six semesters where students will pick a \u2018major\u2019 subject and a combination of \u2018minor subjects\u2019, \u2018electives\u2019, \u2018skill- based subjects\u2019, internships, workshops and projects,\u201d course coordinator Vishram Dhole said. The BSc blended course is also open for standard XII students but limited to those from the science stream. The university claims that the course will be quality assured by the University of Melbourne and will be considered similar to a University of Melbourne degree worldwide. This will make students eligible for entry into a University of Melbourne or any international MSc programme. In the first and the second year of the course, students would take up subjects from physics, chemistry, environment sciences, biological sciences and earth science. Based on this general but comprehensive grounding, students can then specialize for a \u2018major\u2019 in the third year. A carefully designed curriculum that integrates subjects across disciplines ensures that the content of all first and second year subjects is optimal for a transition to any major in the third year. The course will give students a comprehensive background in basic sciences and prepare them well for taking up higher studies in any discipline at reputed institutes in India, Australia and other countries, Dhole added. While many students opt for higher studies after a bachelor\u2019s in liberal arts, there are also students who get into the job sector after their bachelor\u2019s education. The job opportunities for students of liberal arts generally depended on the specialization subjects, said Anita Patankar, director, Symbiosis School for Liberal Arts. The alumni of Symbiosis School for Liberal Arts are working with the The World Bank, Asian Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs, Gateway House, MullenLowe Lintas, The Times Group, Red Ice Film Productions, she said. Patankar said the transferable skills that students pick up from the interdisciplinary programme, its innovative teaching-learning methods and assessments and strong research and writing skills help them thrive in diverse domains even when they are not specifically trained.

Pune: Crooks offer man\u2019s daughter TV role, dupe him of Rs 55,000A team of cyber sleuths under assistant commissioner of police Nilesh More and senior inspector Radhika Phadke tracked down the suspects to a hotel in Shirdi and took them into custody. The duo were handed over to inspector Mahadeo Kumbhar of the Kondhwa police. Police have recovered two smartphones and Rs24,000 in cash from the brothers. During questioning, the suspects admitted to cheating the complainant. They hatched the plan as Saurav needed money to pay his wife\u2019s medical bills, police said. On May 22, one suspect had sent a message to the complainant\u2019s wife on social media, stating that they wanted a girl between 10 and 12 years old for a role in a serial to be telecast on a leading TV channel. When she sought more details, the suspect shared a mobile number. The following day, she contacted the number and spoke to the other suspect. She shared her daughter\u2019s photographs and profile after obtaining more details about the TV serial.

The film generated a lot of controversy since it showed that a woman could leave her husband to chase her dreams because of infidelity on his part. Two married men blasted me once after the release, asking me how something like this can even be portrayed. The jury members of National Film Awards that year had lively debates about the portrayal of husband and wife in the film. In fact, actor Ashok Kumar and director Yash Chopra, who were both jury members at that time, also asked me some curious questions,\u201d Patel told TOI. The National Film Archive of India (NFAI) screened Umbartha on Saturday evening at its Law College Road theatre, with Patel being present for a short interaction with the audience. The screening is actually the culmination of a series of films screened as a tribute to Girish Karnad, who passed away earlier this week. Very few copies of the film are available for sale, DVD or otherwise, although the film is screened periodically on Marathi television channels. As a foil to Patil\u2019s upright character and steely resolve, Patel needed someone masculine yet harmless-looking, and in Karnad, he found the perfect Subhash Mahajan, who evokes some sympathy, but not quite. \u201cGirish fit the bill perfectly. He looked masculine in the film, but also quite harmless. He would evoke some sympathy from viewers when he would take the lead and convince his mother that his wife should be able to go and pursue her dreams, and also at moments of separation. But his betrayal at the end would shatter all of that. His was a smaller role compared to Smita\u2019s, but Girish said that he would do the film anyway. We shot the Marathi and Hindi versions together and he was consistent throughout,\u201d Patel remarked. The film was an adaptation of Marathi novel Beghar by Shanta Nisal. \u201cThe novel goes beyond Sulabha (Patil\u2019s character) leaving the house after learning about her husband\u2019s infidelity, but Vijay Tendulkar suggested not adapting that part. A statement had to be made at the end of the film,\u201d he said.

The trackmen and officials monitoring the CCTV cameras have been told to remain on full alert. \u201cThe CCTV cameras are monitored by officials at nearby stations and technical halts. Instructions have been issued to them to monitor all the cameras round-the-clock as the ghat section experiences a lot of rain during monsoon,\u201d Udasi said. The stations in the ghat section, also known as Bor Ghat, are Lonavla, Khandala, Palaswadi and Karjat. Khandala doubles up as a technical halt. Monkey Hill and Thakurwadi are the other technical halts on the stretch. The Pune rail division\u2019s jurisdiction ends at Malavali, after which the Lonavla station comes.

Expert committees are constituted and finally a decision is taken. \u201cThe education ministry all of a sudden said they would not consider the internal marks of students from other boards. The decision to not have internal marks in the SSC board was taken after much thought, which probably backfired. But that doesn\u2019t mean the others have to suffer,\u201d a parent said. Another parent pointed out that since admission to the CBSE schools were over, the new proposal, if accepted, would be detrimental to the students from the CBSE and other non-state boards. \u201cWe did not admit our child to a CBSE school as we wanted him to go to a junior college. But if the state education department decides to not count the internal marks, then he will not get into any good college,\u201d the parent said. Another parent said the move was not justified as the state board students also get additional marks. \u201cThey get almost 15 additional marks if they participate in NCC or sports at some level such as district or national, or participate in drawing competitions. The CBSE students don\u2019t get such additional marks. What they get as part of their internal marks is the average of marks they have scored in all unit tests and projects. They are also for co-curricular activities, which are equally important to evaluate a student\u2019s capacity and understanding of the relevant subject. The state board cannot just decide to subtract them and take only theory marks for consideration,\u201d the parent said.

It will be submitted to the state government within around a fortnight\u2019s time. A chunk of land in Murkute Garden in Baner has been slated for de-reservation. After the de-reservation, around 1.6 lakh soft will be available for construction. The market price of the plot is around Rs40 crore. This has been under process for the past two years. The move has attracted controversy, with a group of residents opposing it. The residents even carried out a signature campaign last August. The residents had claimed that ideally, 16 hectares should be reserved for the Baner-Balewadi area. But currently, they have only 8.37 hectares. The owner of the land, on the other hand, has supported the conversion of the land from garden to residential zone, saying ample space was available for the garden purposes. Baner-Balewadi has around 18 gardens. But most are unused. \u201cMy ancestors have already given over 85,000 ares for gardens in this area.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

With the 10th annual meeting of International Pulsar Timing Array Collaboration being hosted in Pune next week, India is hoping to soon become a permanent member of International Pulsar Timing Array Collaboration. Pulsar is a highly magnetized rotating celestial object of very high mass that emits a beam of electromagnetic radiation. \u201cThe radiation can be seen when it points towards the earth as pulses of emission, which appear with clockwork precision. Hence, they are the best celestial clocks,\u201d said Gopakumar, senior scientist, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai \u201cNow, if there is a gravitational wave passing past the pulsar, there will be a blip or difference in the otherwise disciplined pulses. By studying this variation over a period of time, we can determine a pattern in it. This pattern will tell us about the gravitational waves. Now gravitational waves are like waves with a ripple effect just like the ripple effect we see when a pebble is dropped in a pond. Instead of the up and down motion, the G waves are like sound waves; they expand and compress,\u201d said Mavia McLaughlin, professor of physics and astronomy, West Virginia University, the US. The team has been collecting data on the arrival time of pulsars. \u201cMore the data on arrival time of pulsars, more we can understand if there is a pattern of change in them and the cause. So data collection and analysis of pulsars are being done by the Indian team,\u201d said Andrea Lommen, professor of astronomy and physics, Haverford College, the US. The group is hoping to detect a gravitational wave of ultra-low frequency but other than that they said that their research will have by-product discoveries too. \u201cFrom accuracy in understanding the position of the sun to understanding how early galaxies were formed, how they expand and also how they merge, there will be a lot of by-product research result to the G Wave result,\u201d said B C Joshi, senior scientist, National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA). The experiments started in 2001 and India is trying to be a permanent member of this project involving 12 countries. \u201cThe upgraded GMRT is able to analyse at least three bands of frequencies. We have been collecting data for the past four years and now we have approached the international group with a deliverable data which, hopefully, will also lead to a membership,\u201d said Yashwant Gupta, centre director, NCRA.

A new government resolution (GR) was issued this month following rising complaints about officials not attending to citizens properly. The GR iterates that the government officials must maintain strict adherence to the timing. All employees from a department cannot go for lunch at the same time.

The programme director of Parisar, an environmental organization, Ranjit Gadgil, told TOI that the move was good, but it should be implemented properly. \u201cThe officers have to adhere to these norms and citizens should not be made to wait and suffer,\u201d he said. Activist Vihar Durve himself had to wait for long at Mantralaya earlier because of the \u201cextended lunch\u201d of officials. Hailing the decrease in the lunch break timing, he said the focus should be on concerted effort to clear the files at the earliest. \u201cThere is no point in just reducing the lunch time if they delay the process of clearing files or refuse to meet citizens,\u201d he added. In September 2001, the state government had fixed half-an-hour slot between 1pm and 2pm for its officials at Mantralaya (state secretariat) in Mumbai. But the government had not fixed the lunch time for other offices in the state. \u201cThis is a step further and will limit the recess of all officers and staffers in the state government departments,\u201d stated a revenue department official from the Pune division.

Police said one suspect sent a message to the complainant\u2019s wife on social media, stating that they wanted a girl between 10 and 12 years old for a role in a serial to be telecast on a leading TV channel on May 22. When she sought more details, the suspect share a mobile number. The following day, she contacted the number and spoke to the other suspect.

The suspect called her later, informing her that the girl\u2019s profile got selected and told the woman to visit Mumbai to finalize the details, police said. The woman then contacted her husband, a PWD consultant, who was in Aurangabad, and gave him the suspect\u2019s phone number. The man called the suspect and agreed to visit Mumbai to sign a contract. On the conman\u2019s behest, the consultant transferred Rs25,000 and Rs30,000 into their bank account and went to Mumbai. The suspects called him to two places, including a film studio in Juhu, but avoided meeting him in person. Further, the suspects began avoiding the complainant on one excuse or the other, before he stopped taking the man\u2019s calls altogether. He also did not refund the money to the consultant, police said. Realizing that he was cheated, the consultant filed a complaint application with the cyber police station, which in turn referred the application to the Kondhwa police for further action. On Thursday, the police recorded his statement and registered an FIR under relevant sections of the IPC and the IT Act.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

With the pre-test operation of the entire process proposed to be conducted all over India in select sample units during August and September, census office sources told TOI that three districts in Maharashtra, having both rural and urban population, will be covered and the sample size of the population will be decided soon. However, the districts where the pre-test will be carried out have not been disclosed . A workshop was held in Pune from June 3-11 with master trainers conducting field trials in select areas in Pune district. Senior officials from the state census department said headmasters and teachers will be roped in for the project. The national trainers were trained last month and they are now training master trainers from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Telangan and Goa. They will then train the field functionaries for the pre-test, the officials added. Senior officials said the pre-test will have to be carried out with care in order to finalise the instruments, method and processing of the actual census. The pre-test of census will be extremely challenging as digital mode of data collection will be tested in the field for the first time. This will ensure timely publication of census data. For the Census 2021, enumerators will no longer need to carry voluminous paper to record data, with the Registrar General of India (RGI) and Census Commissioner working on a mobile application that will help them capture data on their respective phones. This will eliminate the laborious process of electronic data entries, besides making compilation of data easier and faster, stated an official. This is for the first time in the 140-year history of the census that the data will be collected through mobile app. Enumerators will be paid appropriate remuneration for using their own mobile devices to record census data, officials said. They will also have the option of collecting data through the usual paper work. However, they will have to submit all the data electronically. The Census 2021 is the world\u2019s largest enumeration exercise as per the home ministry.

The city which sent eight BJP MLAs to the assembly and had two ministers till recently will now be deprived of any ministerial representation. Dilip Kamble, the only ministerial representative from Pune, was dropped in the reshuffle effected on Sunday. Kamble, who represents Pune Cantonment assembly constituency, was the minister of state for social justice and special assistance. The other minister, Girish Bapat, who was elected as Member of Parliament recently, resigned from the state assembly. He was the minister for food, civil supplies and consumer protection, food and drugs administration, parliamentary affairs in the Devendra Fadnavis government. \u201cI was among the first 10 state ministers who took oath as soon as the government was formed in 2014. I am happy with my tenure and grateful to the party and the chief minister for the opportunity to work as a minister,\u201d Kamble told TOI on Sunday. During his tenure, he took some landmark decisions that will help youngsters from the deprived classes in the long run, he said. They include ease of providing caste certificates, scholarships for international studies and building hostels for needy students. The minister had courted controversy over some remarks which he had later backtracked after public anger swelled. He was embroiled in an alleged case of corruption. The police, acting on directives from the court, had registered a case against him and four others for allegedly cheating a trader by promising him two liquor shop licences. Kamble said controversies would happen with people in public life and he has moved on. He added that he would come out clean. The opposition parties have expressed surprise over leaving out Pune without minister to represent it. The BJP on the other hand claimed that the cabinet changes will not adversely impact the city\u2019s development. \u201cPune is the second biggest city after Mumbai and not having a single minister is strange. Such a big metropolis must have a ministerial representative. It helps in putting forward the issues of the city and generating funds for development works,\u201d Ramesh Bagwe, city unit chief of Congress and former state minister, said. Several BJP leaders in the city said the reshuffle and the absence of any representative from Pune will not affect the development projects in the city. \u201cThe decision to make changes in the state cabinet is taken at the chief minister\u2019s office level. They must have thought out a policy and made some calculations before taking the call. The changes will not create any obstacle in the decision-making process for city.

The department had shifted to the cloud technology to beat server snags earlier this year. Initially, some changes in the government receipt accounting system (GRAS) servers had hampered the registration process. Now, the changes in the land record servers are slowing down the process, senior registration department officials said. The Inspector General of Registration and Stamps (IGR) department had earlier this year uploaded its 150TB data on to the cloud to ensure a snag-free service at its property registration offices. IGR officials said the changes made in the web security services of the finance and land records departments have developed glitches, leading to the delay in the work. An official said, \u201cThese troubles will be ironed out once all the departments, particularly that of land and finance, are integrated with the registration department. Whenever there\u2019s a change in the functioning of these departments, it slows down the servers. As a result, the overall registration process slows down.\u201d The official said the land record servers, that have already migrated to the cloud technology, were slowing down the overall registration process as the 7/12 extract data are not getting immediately reflected. Earlier, changes in the GRAS servers, which generate challans, could not be accessed by the registration department. The department had a few months ago sought a standard operating procedure (SOP) for all departments and their integration with the registration offices to avoid such a situation. \u201cHowever, it is yet to happen,\u201d the official said. Earlier, the finance department had made some changes in its web security certificate, which affected the web service programmes and hampered the registration work. Citizens said the department must ensure proper communications to reduce their inconveniences. Advocate Amitabh Mehta, who has raised the issue of the frequent technical snags with the property registration department, said almost all its offices were facing some issues despite the shift to cloud. He said the outstation citizens were the worst hit, as they have come to the city for the registration.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party.

It will be a keenly fought battle between Tamilisai and DMK\u2019s state women wing secretary and Rajya Sabha MP K Kanimozhi in Tuticorin. Though Tamilisai initially preferred to contest from Chennai South, which has a sizeable votebank for the party, she finally settled for Tuticorin.

The wind pattern over parts of southern Maharashtra has already changed to westerly, with rainfall in several locations and heavy showers in isolated areas. But the monsoon appears to be weak in the south, as its progress has slowed down due to weak rainfall activity over Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. As a result, the progress of the northern limit of monsoon has been hampered towards the eastern coast, while the conditions are favourable towards the west coast. IMD officials, however, said the monsoon could strengthen in the next three or four days and cover all of Maharashtra by June 24 \u2014 June 25 at the latest \u2014 around 12 days later than the normal onset date. Monsoon normally covers most of Maharashtra by around June 12. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD-Pune, told TOI that there was no progress in the monsoon on Saturday, with its northern limit still over Mangalore, Mysore, Salem, Cuddalore, Agartala, Lumding, and Passighat. \u201cCurrently, though conditions seem favourable over parts of south Maharashtra, Konkan and Goa, we cannot declare an onset. This region has been getting good rainfall due to the wind pattern (here becoming westerly) and the presence of an offshore trough, resulting in continuous rains in the windward side of the Sahyadri range. But the monsoon has been weak over parts of the south peninsular India, including south interior Karnataka, north interior Karnataka, Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra (in Andhra Pradesh) and Telangana,\u201d he said. To maintain the monsoon\u2019s spatial continuity, Kashyapi said, the onset over parts of south Maharashtra and Konkan still cannot be declared, as the monsoon will first have to cover parts of south peninsular India. \u201cWhatever moisture was there over these regions was depleted by the very severe cyclonic storm, Vayu. That is why the monsoon\u2019s advance over parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and the rest of Tamil Nadu is becoming a problem. So technically, the monsoon\u2019s onset over parts of Maharashtra still cannot be declared, as the monsoon needs to proceed in a uniform manner,\u201d he said. Kashyapi said that the monsoon vortex is likely to strengthen over the Bay of Bengal in three to four days. \u201cIn another two days, the monsoon may further progress over northeast India and may cover most of that region by three to four days. We expect the formation of a low pressure system over the Bay of Bengal in a few days, which will strengthen the Bay of Bengal branch of the monsoon over Coastal Andhra. Thus, going by this, monsoon may enter extreme southern parts of Maharashtra by June 20 at the latest,\u201d said Kashyapi. This way, the monsoon may cover the whole of Maharashtra, including Pune, by June 25 at the latest. \u201cBy then, even Vidarbha and Marathwada will get good spells of rain. However, due to the delayed onset of monsoon over Kerala and Vayu, the cumulative June rainfall for Maharashtra as well as India as a whole may still be below normal,\u201d said Kashyapi.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The parking in-charge at a mall told TOI that the charges were decided after much thought to deter visitors from taking undue advantage of the parking space. \u201cWe have limited space and parking fee is just a way to deter outsiders (who do not want to visit the mall) from parking here. Also, a lot goes into the maintenance of the parking space, including employing security personnel, parking wardens, housekeeping staff and maintaining fire fighting system, smoke detectors, among others,\u201d he said. Besides, a visit to these establishments revealed that variation in parking fee was quite rampant. When asked about it, the parking in-charge said, \u201cThis is bound to happen as these charges are dependent on the location, with those in the prime localities charging a higher fee.\u201d When TOI correspondent visited a mall, the parking attendant said they were charging a \u2018parking maintenance fee\u2019 of Rs 30 for the first two hours for four-wheelers and an additional Rs 10 per hour thereafter during weekdays. \u201cDuring weekends, the charges for four-wheeler parking rises to Rs 50 for the first three hours and an additional Rs 10 per hour beyond the stipulated period,\u201d he said. When asked the rationale behind the rise in fee during weekends, the parking in-charge said, \u201cMore people visit the mall during weekends and the rise in parking fee is to ensure that people do not occupy the space unnecessarily. In case a person loses the parking ticket, a flat Rs 100 is charged from him/her.\u201d Another mall representative said, \u201cOn weekends (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) and public holidays, we have a progressive parking rule where duration of parking invites the charges. For instance, the parking fee for two hours for a four-wheeler is Rs 50 and Rs 30 for a two-wheeler. For every additional hour over this, Rs 10 is charged. During weekdays, the parking fee for a four-wheeler for more than half an hour is Rs 40 and for a two-wheeler is Rs 20.\u201d Another mall in-charge said if parking was made free, the checking of vehicles would stop. \u201cThis will give a free hand to disruptive elements to enter the space undeterred. Even the civic body charges fee for parking on roads. Instead of making parking free, the PMC should ensure a strong public transportation system to reduce the number of vehicles on city roads,\u201d he said. A city-based multiplex owner said there was no provision in the development control (DC) rules to make parking free. \u201cAll multiplexes charge fee according to their parking area maintenance cost, location of the establishment and availability of the space. The state government too had earlier passed a similar order but withdrew it in two weeks,\u201d he said. Awais Ansari, admin manager, Pune Central Mall, said the parking charge was Rs 40 for a four-wheeler and Rs 20 for a two-wheeler. \u201cHowever, this can be redeemed at the end of one\u2019s shopping from the cash counter,\u201d he said. Citizens said malls should not extract money in the name of parking facilities. \u201cMalls should focus on easing it (parking fee) out for legit shoppers and visitors,\u201d Viplav Shukla, a consultant, said. While the proposal to have free parking in the malls might look good on paper, some citizens were worried about the security aspect. \u201cI feel they should have subsidized parking rates and not charge Rs 20-40 as it would ensure vigilance of the security guards on the vehicles parked at these places. What is the guarantee that miscreants would not come and park two-wheelers at such locations?\u201d S Balakrishnan, an entrepreneur, asked.

This was revealed in the decadal cyclone data provided by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Even though the IMD said the storm skirted the Saurashtra coast, the system was very likely to move nearly westwards during the next 48 hours. Last time a very severe cyclonic storm hit the Arabian Sea was in June 2010. The storm was christened 'Phet'. \"In terms of severity, the last time such a cyclone formed over the north Indian Ocean was in June 2010 (Phet). This one had also come as far as Gujarat. It was the last very severe cyclonic storm over the north Indian Ocean in June, after which there was none until Vayu,\" A K Srivastava, head, Climate Research Division, IMD, Pune, said. Srivastava said Phet began forming around May 31 as a depression and continued till around June 7 as a system of various intensities, including very severe cyclonic storm. \"But that was during the start of the monsoon season. Vayu, meanwhile, occurred after the monsoon set in over Kerala and was still strengthening. Thus it slightly disturbed the monsoon flow. Even though this may not always be the case, but cyclones forming and moving away from the coast tend to disturb the monsoon flow usually,\" he said. JR Kulkarni, chairman, Indian Meteorological Society (IMS), Pune, said a very severe cyclonic storm in June was rare. \"Such type of a system can do either of the two things. If it had moved quickly towards the Oman coast, it may have even caused quick monsoon onset over parts of the south peninsular India and west coast. However, Vayu kept moving northwards along the coast initially. One of its descending limbs over land regions like Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala sucked in all the moisture, which is not conducive to the monsoon onset,\" Kulkarni said. A cyclone expert at the ministry of earth sciences said it was in June 2007 that Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu had formed, which was even greater in intensity than Phet and Vayu. \"This means that there are instances when systems with the intensity of a very severe cyclonic storm and above have formed in June in the past and thus it cannot be called unusual. At times they tend to enhance monsoon, while other times they adversely affect it. This time, however, Vayu seems to have had a negative impact on monsoon,\" he said.

Asked about Congress' Delhi unit president Sheila Dikshit's remarks that Kejriwal never approached her for an alliance, the chief minister said, \u201cWe have met Rahul Gandhi. Dikshit is not that important leader.\u201d Kejriwal has been urging the Congress to stitch an alliance in Delhi for the Lok Sabha polls to keep the BJP away from power. Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.

The Kothrud police said the accident occurred around 10.30pm on the steep slope connecting Chandni Chowk to Paud Road. A resident of the Siddhivinayak Krupa society, Surekha Pradeep Wani was critically injured and was taken to Sassoon General Hospital. Doctors in the hospital declared her dead on arrival. Her husband, Pradeep Wani (64), was injured in his leg while trying to avert the collision. The police have arrested the truck driver for negligent driving. The scooterist who had flouted the rule fled the spot. On Sunday, Wani told TOI that he had gone to a friend\u2019s house in Bavdhan with his wife, their two sons and daughters-in-law for dinner on Saturday. \u201cWe usually travel together in car. But we went to Bavdhan on our two-wheelers because one of my sons had bought tickets for a play after the dinner,\u201d he said. Around 10.30pm, Wani and his wife left Bavdhan for home on his two-wheeler. \u201cI was descending the slope near Chandni Chowk to reach Paud Road. I suddenly spotted a man on a white scooter speeding in from the opposite direction towards Chandni Chowk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe person was riding along the wrong side of the road, which is not only narrow but is also dangerous because of the steep slope. I started shouting at the scooterist to alert him that he was violating the wrong-side rule. He, however, paid no attention and kept on speeding,\u201d Wani said. \u201cAll that I remember that a multi-axle truck was passing by us. I cannot recall what happened at that moment. I felt a jerk in the scooter and my wife fell on the right side of the road. Her left leg and hand came under the wheels of the heavily loaded truck,\u201d he said. The accident survivor said despite all his attempts, he could not remove Surekha out of the truck. \u201cShe remained stuck under the wheels of the truck and kept on looking at me helplessly. Someone contacted the police and ambulance,\u201d Wani said. A police team reached the spot and managed to remove Surekha from the spot. She was taken to the Sassoon hospital, where the doctors pronounced her dead on arrival. Kothrud police inspector Shankar Khatke told TOI that the Mumbai-bound truck was also descending the slope. \u201cWe have arrested the truck driver,\u201d he said. The left side of the slope that connects Chandni Chowk to Paud Road has been dug up for the ongoing Chandni Chowk flyover work. The road is already narrow and has become more risky, especially during night hours, because of the flyover work. The police have restricted the entry of vehicles from Paud Road to avoid accidents. However, many people violate the rule to avoid a detour to reach Bavdhan. Kothrud traffic branch inspector Ajay Chandkhede said, \u201cA team of Kothrud police has been deployed where the slope connects the bypass during day time. Similarly, a team of Warje police is deployed at Chandni chowk. We are regularly taking action against the people violating the no-entry rule.\u201d Wrong-side driving has become rampant across the city, leading to quite a few accidents across the city (see graphic). Inspector Khatke said as per police commissioner K Venkatesham\u2019s directions, action was being taken against the wrong-side drivers under Section 279 (rash driving) of the Indian Penal Code. If convicted under the section, a driver can be fined Rs1,000 or face imprisonment for up to six months, or both. On June 6, the traffic branch had taken action against 67 motorists for wrong-side driving.
