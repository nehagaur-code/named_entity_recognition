You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

BJP\u2019s Sunil Mendhe is pitted against Nana Panchbudhe of NCP here. Bopche\u2019s rebellion had created panic in the BJP camp as he is popular in the Pawar community and in general among OBCs. In Nagpur, Abdul Karim Patel and Ravikant Meshram, withdrew on Thursday, taking the total number to three. Pallavi Nandeshwar had withdrawn on Wednesday. In Ramtek, Sachin Shende, Gajanan Jambhulkar, Prakash Tembhurne, Ranjit Saphelkar and Lalit Shamkuwar have opted out of the race. In Yavatmal-Washim and Wardha, seven and two candidates respectively withdrew on the final day. One independent candidate withdrew his nomination in Gadchiroli-Chimur constituency on Thursday.

Pressure further mounted on the striking doctors to find a solution to the standoff.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

Presiding over a review meeting of the education department, he also set a week's deadline for police verification of drivers and conductors so that the process was completed before schools reopened after summer vacation. Yogi said most private schools would reopen after June 20 and government ones after July 1, which meant police verification should be completed ahead of that. The CM's concerns over student safety stem from accidents involving school vehicles in the recent past. In March, a school bus overturned in Etah leaving several children injured. In Bhadohi earlier this year, at least 12 students suffered burns when a school bus caught fire from a leaking cooking gas cylinder strapped to the vehicle. In April 2018, 13 schoolchildren were killed when a school van was hit by a speeding train in Kushinagar. It was later found that the van did not have a valid permit and the driver, who also died in the mishap, was a minor. To streamline functioning of educational institutions in the state, the government had earlier slashed the number of holidays and this, Yogi said, was benefiting students. \"In fact, the practice is being adopted by other state governments too,\" he said, adding that teachers must utilise holidays to communicate with parents. \"Government school offices must thus reopen by June 25.\" The CM emphasised on constitution of Former Students' Council in every school, college and university. \"Former students should be felicitated on August 15 and January 26.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination.

With the results, a gateway for admission to top engineering institutions, now set to decide what college they get, most students share that their aim is to become the best computer engineer in the country. Scoring all India rank (AIR) 1,113, Prajit Kumar said, \"I will make it to an IIT easily but my only wish is to pursue computer science engineering from IIT Bombay.

It was my second attempt. From the 15,000th rank in the first attempt, I have made it to close to 1,000. Self-study with regular breaks helped me improve my score,\" he added. Kumar advises that one should not rush through topics in a hurry to cover the entire syllabus without focusing on fundamentals. Studying round-the-clock is not important, but it should be ensured that whatever one studies makes concepts clear, he added. Prasoon Bajpai, who secured 1,173rd rank, said he wants to be a computer engineer so that he can fix technical snags that give a tough time to students during results. \"Technology is something that eases life and reduces stress. I want to develop a software that helps in fixing technical snags, especially like the one which had hit JEE (Advanced) results today,\" he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

In six years, the water level has gone down by six metres. In other words, water is now available at twice the depth it was in 2013,\u201d said a senior official. The reason behind the depletion, say experts, has been indiscriminate extraction of groundwater through tubewells and submersible pumps for domestic and commercial purposes. In 2013, the city had 520 government tubewells to supply drinking water in 112 localities. Today, there are 775 supplying water to 175 areas, courtesy rising demand owing to an increase in population.

Besides, hundreds of submersible pumps have been installed by people for personal and commercial uses. There is no account of the quantity of water being drawn by these pumps, sources said.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal.

With nearly 20 lakh MT still left to be purchased, the deadline, which ended on May 31, has been extended to end-June, as sowing of paddy has already begun. State agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi told TOI that the purchase targets may have been affected as government staff were deployed in election duty. \u201cAnother reason could be that wheat-growers may have found the prices in the open market more lucrative,\u201d said Shahi. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has been reviewing wheat purchase and has often asked food department officials to ensure that purchase centres are functional and farmers do not face any hardship in selling their produce to the government. This year, the state agriculture department had enhanced the MSP of wheat to Rs 1,840 per quintal, and had even added an incentive of Rs 20 per quintal for transportation, to provide relief to distressed farmers. However, despite the CM\u2019s insistence on making processes easy and raising of MSP, the purchase has fallen below target. Estimates by government say the total purchase may not cross even 40 lakh MT. Agriculture department officials, told TOI on condition of anonymity that since wheat production in the state was low this time season as compared to the previous year, there could be an increase in wheat prices in the market. Shahi, however, denied this claim. \u201cThe estimated production of wheat in the state was nearly 380 lakh MT while last year it was nearly 356 lakh MT. Not only production, even productivity has risen this year, from 36.56 quintal to 37.58 quintal per hectare,\u201d said Shahi. \u201cLower sale by farmers at government purchase centres is an indication of farmers getting better prices at their farms itself,\u201d said food and civil supplies commissioner Alok Kumar. \u201cThis is the purpose of the state government in fixing MSP for farmers. We provide MSP to farmers so that they are not exploited by traders in the open market and they sell their produce to the government at better prices. If they are not selling their produce to government agencies at MSP, it means they are getting better and remunerative prices in open market. This is the aim of the government -- that farmers should get better price,\u201d said Kumar. \u201cThere has been an increase in demand for wheat from southern states this year. And, the market price of wheat has also increased in equal proportion. So, failing to meet purchase target is not a matter of concern,\u201d added Kumar.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Sara Ali Khan": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/fathers-day-sara-ali-khan-shares-the-cutest-throwback-pictures-with-father-saif-ali-khan/videoshow/69811423.cms", "description": ""}, "PM writes to village heads in UP, urges them to conserve water": {"time": "2019-06-15 21:14:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-writes-to-village-heads-in-up-urges-them-to-conserve-water/articleshow/69805182.cms", "description": "LUCKNOW: Suresh Kumar, head of ramtola village in Sonbhadra, was supervising work at his fields on Saturday evening when he got a call from his father. \u201cYou have got a letter from the PM,\u201d informed the excited elderly.

Quickly reading the content, Suresh said: \u201che (PM) has emphasised on the importance of water conservation and rain water harvesting.\u201d Agreeing with the need to save water head of Kaancha village, Mohd Kuddoos said: \u201cPeople listened to PM\u2019s mann ki baat but forgot about it later.

Adding that efforts must be made to save rain water as far as possible, the PM further wrote: \u201cLet us get trenches made around the fields, build check dams and dikes, take up cleaning and rejuvenation of ponds, construct tankaas (underground water storage tanks) and ensure zero wastage of the rain water.\u201d Officials in the state rural development informed that the letter is being sent to over 97,000 heads in 75 districts of UP. To note, ground water situation in the state is dismal. As per state government data 217 blocks across 22 districts belong to over exploited (critical) and semi-critical categories. NITI Aayog\u2019s Composite Water Management Index Report 2018 also expressed concern over the situation in UP. Stated that the groundwater crisis in UP is progressively worsening, the report attributed the problem to factors like unplanned urbanisation, unabated boring, rampant exploitation of groundwater and surface water by government and private bodies, failure to replenish it through rainwater harvesting and lack of awareness among people among other things. It pointed out that the state has a gross withdrawal of about 5.28 million hectares, among the highest in India. Experts welcomed the move hoping that it would get its due importance. \u201cCommunity led initiatives are more sustainable,\u201d said Farrukh R Khan of Wateraid, a not for profit organisation that works for the water related issues. Technical expert in hydrogeology and former scientist at the state ground water department, RS Sinha said that the letter provides an opportunity to address the issue but warned against the rat-race that may follow in the bid to attract the PM\u2019s attention. \u201cIt is been over 15 years since the issue of groundwater was identified. A number of success stories can be heard but many things are taking place in pockets. Stakeholder departments must ensure that a micro-planning is undertaken before people join the bandwagon,\u201d he said. He informed that there were demand and supply aspects to water conservation \u2013 be it on the ground or beneath it. \u201cStrategies listed out by the PM speak about the paradigm of supply. Strategies change from place to place. Steps must be taken to reduce the demand to check wastage and ensure optimum utilisation of available water,\u201d he explained. Experts also underscored the need to implement available rules for rain water harvesting in urban areas.

But it was a long time ago that I explored the city properly. I remember wandering about in Bhool Bhulaiyya, Bada Imambara, Ghanta Ghar and all the historic places in Lucknow. And Lucknow is also known for its avid connection to history,\" said the 'Chaand Sifarish' singer. Further appreciating the quality of food Lucknow serves, the singer said, \"Of course, wahan ke kebabs and wahan ka khana is wonderful. Be it Tunday or be it Dastarkhwan, the food has always been amazing.\" Besides food and culture, Shaan also loved the crowd whenever he has performed in Lucknow. \"I\u2019ve performed in the Lucknow Mahotsav more than once, and I always had a wonderful experience performing here in the city. The crowd of Lucknow is very energetic and enthusiastic. The best thing about the Lucknow Mahotsav was the organised crowd and the disciplined people,\" said Shaan. Shaan, who is known for songs like 'Hey Shona' and 'All Is Well', doesn\u2019t believe in discussing political issues and loves to remain politically neutral. \"I don\u2019t have any political opinion or views. I\u2019d rather have social views. Jo hum political discussions karte hain usse better hai ki hum social discussions karein. Everyone can bring a change at some level, without relying on political support or alliance. We should leave the politics to the politicians. I myself work on social issues through my music. I have composed a song on air pollution among other social issue based songs. I am also doing a campaign on cancer awareness. So I think we should prioritize social issues over political issues,\" believes Shaan.  Shaan (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Not having heard of the #Mentoo movement yet, the singer believes that it is justified, \"I actually wasn\u2019t aware of the #Mentoo movement. Kabhi aisi naubat aayi hi nahi ki main #Metoo controversy mein phansu. So kabhi #Mentoo ke baare me socha nahi.\" Further speaking about the movement, he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s justified because if you accuse someone of anything and if it includes an accusation on their character, then it is a big thing and usse nikalna bahot mushkil hota hai. And in some cases, where the allegations are wrong then zindagi bhar ke liye dhabba lag jata hai. However, this #Mentoo movement, where a male can raise his voice against wrong allegations, I think it is a good move. Unhe yeh liberty milni chahiye.\" The singer also is in support of the #Metoo movement and says it was a good step in the industry, \u201cThe #Metoo movement was necessary because people who were in power took things for granted. They thought ke haan hum kuchh bhi kar sakte hain and humein koi nahi rok sakta. So I think the inception of the #Metoo movement was also a good step.\" Shaan is seen working in less Bollywood projects currently. He is spending more time in other things including travelling and learning guitar. \"I am a singer and I love to sing songs, doesn\u2019t matter if it is in a Bollywood movie or not. When I was singing for Bollywood and was into playback singing, I didn\u2019t have time to do many other things like composing a song. Now what is happening is ke main workout ka bhi mazaa le raha hoon, vacations kar raha hoon, guitar sikh raha hoon. So mujhe bahot zyada waqt mil raha hai to do other things. And saath-saath I\u2019m singing songs too, it\u2019s just not too much Bollywood songs,\" said Shaan. \u2014 Saad Abbasi Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Seven-year-old girl raped, killed by father's acquaintance in UP": {"time": "2019-06-15 19:32:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/seven-year-old-girl-raped-killed-by-fathers-acquaintance-in-up/articleshow/69803891.cms", "description": "GORAKHPUR: A seven-year-old girl was allegedly raped and killed by her father's acquaintance here following which he was arrested on Saturday, police said.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Asked about Congress' Delhi unit president Sheila Dikshit's remarks that Kejriwal never approached her for an alliance, the chief minister said, \u201cWe have met Rahul Gandhi. Dikshit is not that important leader.\u201d Kejriwal has been urging the Congress to stitch an alliance in Delhi for the Lok Sabha polls to keep the BJP away from power. Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.
