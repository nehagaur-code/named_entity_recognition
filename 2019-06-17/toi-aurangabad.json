Coaches and players say that the game helps one to develop stamina, coordination and concentration which aids in practicing other sports and improves studies. After the recent success of local athletes in the sport at international level, the stakeholders hope that the interest for the game will grow. In the 6th South Asian Jump Rope Championship organised by Bhutan Jump Rope Association from May 27 to 30 in Thimpu Bhutan, Harsheesh Singh Dhingra won two gold medals in under-16 category while Vyankatesh Udawant, Harsh Takwale, Ghanshyam Bhagwatkar, Vedant Wahatule and Vishal Mhaske from the city won two gold medals each in Under-17 category. The students were selected for the international squad considering their performance in the last one year in the state-level jump rope competitions. Certified jump rope coach Abhishek Narwade said that the sport has gained attention from 2006 when the Maharashtra Jump Rope Association came into existence. \"Apart from the achievements one can get in the jump rope events, playing the sport helps to build a base for all other outdoor sports. Jump rope helps improve stamina, coordination, breathing control and improves concentration in studies,\" Narwade said. Harsheesh Dhingra, one of the athletes from Delhi Public School Aurangabad, said that the sport has helped him improve his other interest i.e. swimming. Harsheesh has reached at national-level in swimming. Harsh Takwale, another jump rope athlete, said that he was introduced to jump rope as a professional sport three years ago and since then he has been constantly participating in various state and national championships. \"Over the years, my energy levels are high and my academic scores have improved,\" Takwale said.

Each junior college has its own schedule for admissions. Students and parents often struggle while keeping a tab on admission prospects. Santosh Gilda, an education activist associated with a city-based parents\u2019 forum, said Latur must be included in the CAP for Class XI admissions as soon as possible. He also made a serious allegation of corruption within the system. \u201cBesides the obvious inconvenience to parents and students, we suspect there is an active network of touts in Latur. The touts, in collusion with certain heads institutions, help with admissions after charging families Rs 1 to Rs 1.5 lakh,\u201d said Gilda, who is a lawyer by profession. He added that students are forced to purchase admission forms of multiple colleges to stay in the race for admissions. \u201cThe CAP for Class XI admissions, if introduced, will protect families from such additional expenditure,\u201d Gilda said. The state education department had introduced the CAP for Aurangabad, Nashik, Amravati and Nagpur from academic year 2017-18. The system is already in place across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority and Pune (Municipal limits). But despite being a major education hub, Latur, known for its unique pattern for preparing students for national-level entrance examinations such as JEE or NEET, is still beyond the purview of the CAP. The Latur pattern, practiced by a few leading colleges especially for the science stream, involves reduced academic sessions for Class XI to instead focus on rigorous preparations for Class XII. The pattern has drawn criticism from experts, who have objected to skipping of certain parts of the Class XI syllabus. They claim the Latur pattern of learning compromises quality and scope of education to only focus on a good outcome for Class XII examination. Another education activist, Sanideval Jadhav, said the demand for admissions reforms for Class XI admissions has been falling on deaf ears. \u201cWe have been urging officials to set up the CAP for junior colleges. The education department should take steps without wasting any more time,\u201d he said. The deputy director of education for Latur division, Sanjay Yadgire, said it was up to the state government to implement the CAP for Latur. \u201cThe demand by parents, for the CAP in Latur, has been presented to state-level authorities. The CAP was introduced on a pilot basis for Mumbai and Pune. The system is expected to cover more cities in the days to come,\u201d Yadgire said. A member of the management team from a city-based college said institutions would welcome any student-centric reform. \u201cAllegations leveled by some parents - of financial dealings during seat allotment - do not apply to all institutions. There may be some black sheep. But it is wrong to tarnish the Latur pattern of study as a whole,\u201d the member of the management team said.

The latest announcement made by the MLA has confirmed rumours that were making rounds since he resigned from the post of Congress district president about a couple of months ago. The reports of him joining BJP despite being opposed by some party leaders and workers at the local level were making the rounds for the past few days. Speculation was rife that Sattar would contest as an independent candidate in the upcoming assembly elections and join the BJP after emerging victorious. While speaking to TOI, Sattar said, \u201cOn June 14, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and others will join the BJP and inducted into the ministry in another two days. For now, I am busy with my daughter\u2019s wedding scheduled for June 23. Let me make it clear that I am not only joining the BJP but will also become a minister in the government.\u201d The MLA said he is not keen on bagging any ministry in this cabinet expansion as it will keep him occupied in different parts of the state, which will eventually loosen his grip over his constituency ahead of the assembly elections scheduled for October this year. If Sattar joins the BJP, he will be the first Muslim MLA to do so in the state in recent times. The four-time MLA, who is a known Ashok Chavan loyalist, parted ways with Congress after Subhash Zambad was given ticket to contest the general elections from Aurangabad. In protest, Sattar even filed his nomination as an independent before withdrawing from the contest and announcing his support to BJP state president\u2019s son-in-law, Harshvardhan Jadhav, who contested as an independent in the recently held general elections and bagging around 2.85 lakh votes. A decade ago, Sattar was a minister for a brief period in the Congress-NCP government. Political experts feel that the success of AIMIM-VBA candidate Imtiaz Jaleel in the Lok Sabha elections has boosted the morale of this newly-formed political alliance that is working on to contest the assembly elections with full might, thus making it difficult for Congress-NCP to return to power. \u201cConsidering the MIM-VBA presence, Sattar\u2019s move is a win-win situation for the BJP.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Facing outrage for not carrying out timely cleaning of nullahs, city engineer Sakharam Panzade said that their efforts are failing to show impact as people tend to throw waste indiscriminately into the nullahs. \u201cIf we clean the nullah in the morning, by evening on the same day you can see it filled with garbage.

The squads also failed to make any impact on the dumping of waste in nullahs.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

Dabhade said that the government should carry out recruitment of class IV staff and fill the vacant posts. Yelikar informed the union leader that the decision on filling of posts vacated due to retirement or death of staff is to be taken at the level of directorate of medical education and research (DMER). \u201cThe hospital is pursuing the matter with them,\u201d she said.

The committee, which was formed about five years ago, works for save food campaign and has got several function halls, hotels and residents to share the excess food immediately after being prepared with the NGOs that distribute it among the needy.

While referring to the Global Hunger Index related reports, Motale highlighted that every day, food for 200 crore people was being prepared in the country, out of which food meant for 100 crore people was thrown in the garbage. This eventually leaves at least 27 crore people hungry, he said. He also said that marriage functions are the places where food goes to waste. The government officials concerned have urged hotel owners to follow norms to avoid food wastage, said Motale, adding that hoteliers have agreed to cooperate and have decided to offer 10% discount to the customers per thali if they finish everything served.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

A division bench of Justices TV Nalawade and KK Sonawane gave the directions on the petition filed by one Rajabhau Phad. According to the petition, the land at Pus village in Ambajogai tehsil of Beed belongs to the government and was given to the Belkhandi Math in Beed as gift when Ranit Wyanka Giri was its mahant. However, as per law, the land cannot be transferred without the government's permission. But after the death of Giri, his heirs transferred the land in their names and claimed that they are its owners and the government was not informed about it. The land was later bought by Munde on the basis of a general power of attorney in 2012. Munde applied for non-agricultural status (NA) of the land and got it, the petition alleged. Phad had approached the Bardapur police station in Beed seeking a criminal case to be lodged against Munde, his wife and others. However, when the police failed to initiate a probe, Phad approached the high court claiming that the land originally belonged to the government and hence, cannot be sold to anyone. He sought an FIR be lodged under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 467, 468 and 471 (forgery) against Munde, his wife and 15 others. Munde's lawyer Siddheshwar Thombre said there was a dispute between the then Math mahant and priest of the trust on this land. He said the matter was taken to court and on the basis of decree, another person became the owner of the land, adding that in 2012, Munde bought the land from that person by adhering to all legal procedures. It was not mentioned anywhere that the land belonged to the government, Munde's lawyer said while asserting that the entire process was legal. The Aurangabad bench of the high court, however, said prima facie it appears the government land was usurped and hence, directed the Bardapur police to file a case against Munde and others and probe the allegations. Thombre later told reporters that they would move the Supreme Court. Reacting to the court order, Munde asserted that the land for the Jagmitra Sugar Mills was purchased \"as per rules and without hoodwinking anyone\". He accused Phad of filing the complaint against him out of \"political vendetta\". Phad is the son-in-law of businessman Ratnakar Gutte, whom Munde had previously accused of securing loan in the name of farmers. Munde also said he would approach the apex court against the high court's order. The NCP leader had last year alleged that Gutte got loans of over Rs 5,400 crore on the basis of fake documents made in the name of farmers. Munde then also alleged that Gutte, the promoter of Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Limited in the state's Parbhani district, had transferred bank loans obtained by various firms into different accounts. \"The land meant for the mill was purchased as per rules, without hoodwinking any organisation, individual or the government. The ruling was obtained from the honourable high court through Phad out of political vendetta, as I had raised a matter relating to Gutte,\" Munde said in a statement. He said documents relating to the mill support his position that there was nothing wrong in the purchase of land and exuded confidence that the Supreme Court will give him relief in the case. \"I raise voice on the issues of public concern and that's why such conspiracy is devised against me ahead of each session of the legislature. I will keep raising voice against the government no matter how many personal attacks are directed at me,\" Munde added.

Jagdale, a homeopathic doctor and a farmer himself, said that the crop loss cannot solely be credited to water scarcity. \u201cFor example, cotton is a crop for regions with dry weather. The crop yields better in drier areas than in water sufficient areas. However, it is due to the poor quality of seeds and fertilizer which causes huge losses to cotton farmers,\u201d he said. The MNS activists met with the state GST officials and informed them about the problem. Speaking to TOI, Santosh Shriwastav, deputy commissioner, state GST, confirmed that the department will hold confidential enquiry to find out about the sale of products without the payment of GST. \u201cI have forwarded the matter to joint commissioner, state tax Aurangabad division. Subsequently, our inspectors will verify the books of accounts of the seed and fertilizer dealers and impose penalty if tax evasion is found,\u201d Shriwastav said. The penalty would include tax collection under the jurisdiction of Aurangabad division state GST office which has districts like Aurangabad, Jalna and Beed districts under them.

In fact for the last four to five months, the feeders record a power outage of four to five hours daily as the transformers, cables and the infrastructure has become old. The situation turns grim in rainy season. However, the impact of the power interruptions on the production is hurting the businesses,\u201d the industry association states. When pursued, the officials of the power distribution company assure uninterrupted electricity supply, the industry body says. When asked MSEDCL superintendent engineer Nirmal B said that the industries have been informed about a maintenance shut down on Friday. \u201cWe will install four AB switches during the shut down which will allow back feeding. If one feeder goes down, we can switch to other feeder and restore the supply immediately,\u201d he said. The overhead cabling is replaced with underground cabling which is causing shut downs but the supply will normalise soon.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

On Friday, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited (MSEDCL) conducted a shut down for maintenance works. As a result, taps ran dry in many areas for sixth consecutive day on Saturday. Residents began calling up tankers but were told about higher than usual rates. Suwarta Dongardive, a resident of Cidco N-6, said her laundry is piling up. \u201cWe cannot afford tankers but there is no option. We earlier used to pay Rs 300-400 for 2,000 litre tanker. Now, we are being asked to pay Rs 600 to private supplier,\u201d she said. Every alternate house in Gulmohar Colony Cidco N-5 has to shell out money to purchase private tankers. In Nandanwan Colony, if one needs a tanker, they have to book a day in advance.

Following this, six MIM corporators were suspended for a day by the mayor. Subsequently, Sena-BJP, Congress and NCP joined hands to condemn the behavior of MIM members and insisted the mayor to pass a resolution to disqualify all the 20 MIM corporators present at the meeting. Following this, the mayor directed the municipal administration to prepare a proposal that will be sent to the state government, seeking its nod to disqualify the unruly corporators. The mayor also asked the civic administration to suspend and inquire the conduct of civic body\u2019s security officer Baburao Jadhav for not handling the situation properly even after being ordered to do so. Ghodele has asked the administration to ensure that 10 ex-servicemen hired by the civic body be posted at every general body meeting to tackle any such eventuality in the future.

Sharad Advant of advocacy group Marathwada Janta Vikas Parishad said the AMC must take proactive measures to ensure no encroachment exists within the blue and red lines of rivers as well on the natural flow of nullahs. \u201cAn appeal made by the civic body is bound to fall on deaf ears. Instead of such half-hearted measures, the civic body should swing into action and remove those structures. Such move will be beneficial for human lives as well as for nature,\u201d he said. Advant added that obstruction in natural flow of rivers and nullahs passing from the city was one of the reasons behind certain localities getting inundated during every monsoon season. When contacted, standing committee chairman Raju Vaidya said efforts were taken in the past to remove encroachments in question but many of those structures came back into existence. \u201cWe will ask authorities from the anti-encroachment department to take necessary action. It is alleged that certain elements from the anti-encroachment department are acting hand-in-glove with such encroachers and such staffers were subjected to stern action if found involved in promoting unauthorised structures,\u201d he said. Notably, the official guidelines allow construction on land between the blue line and red line of rivers for public purposes, like roads, while putting the onus for the loss of life or property during floods on the authority giving permission for land use. However, most of the unauthorised structures in question are private ones.

The power outage not only left the residents sweating, but also led to disruption in water supply in many areas. MIDC Chikalthana industries also remained shut due to power disruption. According to a release by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), due to power outage at Jayakwadi, from 8.30am to 9.40am on Saturday, water could not be lifted at 56MLD and 100MLD pumping stations during that time. Pumping could start at 10.30am from Jayakwadi. This had a domino effect on water pumping station at Pharola, where pumping normalised at 12.30pm. Water works department executive engineer Hemant Kolhe said that it takes around 6 to 8 hours for water to reach the ESRs in the city from Pharola. In addition, as part of its routine pre-monsoon maintenance, the MSEDCL undertook power shutdowns at its feeders supplying power to elevated storage reservoirs (ESRs) at Kranti Chowk, Cidco N-5 and Cidco N-7 from 10.15am to 3.15pm. Subsequently, water supply from these ESRs was affected. Water distribution resumed at 5pm. Tanker supply remained affected throughout Friday in the affected ESRs. Residents from lane number 12 of Jai Bhawani Nagar, who came to Cidco N-5 ESR, said that they had paid for tanker water three months in advance. \u201cThe AMC charges Rs1,100 for 200-litre water on alternate days for three months. Today is the fifth day that we have not received any water. Nine of us paid Rs30 each to come to ESR tanker but they flatly refused supply,\u201d Sunita Shinde, a resident, said. Officials at the AMC water works department said that power shutdown at Jayakwadi on Saturday will affect water supply for two days. The supply will normalise only after two days, they said. Meanwhile, production at industries in Chikalthana MIDC had to bear the impact of MSEDCL\u2019s scheduled shutdown. MSEDCL urban superintending engineer B Nirmal said that the maintenance will help reduce frequent power outages faced by the units in the industrial estate.

Both the donor and the recipient are recovering well, doctors said. 52-year-old Sanjay, assistance commissioner in Nanded Waghala Municipal Corporation, was diagnosed with hepatitis-B by a hospital in Nanded in October. On the medical advice of Gopal Rathi, he was referred to Asian Hospital in Hyderabad. According to Rathi, 80% of Sanjay\u2019s liver was damaged. Sanjay was discharged from the Asian Hospital after initial treatment. However, he started suffering from health issues again in January and this time he was admitted to Global Hospital, Hyderabad. Dharmesh Kapur of Global Hospital conducted an investigations that confirmed that his liver had been completely damaged because of hepatitis-B. The disease had also caused forgetfulness and weakness. \u201cWe were told we have to get a cadaver liver transplant, but in the organ recipient\u2019s waiting list, my father was fiftieth. The doctors said we can\u2019t wait for that long,\u201d Ankita said. The doctors then considered the option of living donor liver transplantation. Subsequently, the possible donors were explored. \u201cFor living organ donation, only brothers, sisters, parents or children are considered.

It's also the first time in years a Shiv Sena leader out of Beed has secured a cabinet berth. The last time the party had this much influence in the region was when Suresh Navale held a minister of state rank back in 1995. Since then, the Sena has been unable to make any considerable progress in the district - eventually reduced to contesting just one seat (Beed city) out of six assembly constituencies. The Sena would contest from the Georai and Ashti seats too, but withdrew when the late BJP stalwart, Gopinath Munde, won negotiations with the party's leadership, Sena observers in Beed told TOI. Khsirsagar, who had much to the chagrin of NCP leaders supported the BJP's Beed nominee Pritam Munde prior to the Lok Sabha polls, enjoys good ties with the Gopinath Munde camp. He is also rumoured to have joined the Sena at the behest of BJP leadership as the Beed city constituency goes to the Sena\u2019s account for the next assembly election if the Sena-BJP poll arrangement is worked out, party sources said. Insiders also ruled out the possibility of a clash between Kshirsagar and the BJP's Pankaja Munde, the rural development minister and Beed\u2019s guardian minister. According to sources, the Sena would want Kshirsagar to expand the party's base in the district and beyond. Sources close to Khshirsgar said he is expected to lose votes from his Muslim and Dalit base. But he stands to get votes from the Sena-BJP catchment, they said, while citing his victory in the 2014 assembly polls in which he defeated Vinayak Mete, the Maratha leader who had contested on a BJP ticket, by a margin of 5,000 votes. News of Kshirsagar's appointment, however, has not gone down well with veteran Sena party workers. \"We now have to work for the man we had fought against,\u2019\u2019 said a senior Sena leader in Beed. He added that the move has \"demoralized\" senior workers of the party. The Aurangabad district found representation in the form of BJP\u2019s Atul Save, the Aurangabad East MLA, although state assembly speaker, Haribhau Bagade, also belongs to the district. Save\u2019s appointment makes a difference as he is essentially a party worker, state BJP president, Shirish Boralkar, told TOI. \"His elevation will strengthen the BJP's presence in the district. It would help the party in the next assembly and the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation elections,\u2019\u2019 Boralkar said. Local sources said Save's appointment would boost the morale of BJP workers in Aurangabad, where the party has been relying on the Shiv Sena, whose four-time MP Chandrakant Khaire lost to the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen's Imtiyaz Jaleel in the Lok Sabha polls. \"Khaire's loss underscores the fact that the Sena has been losing ground here,\" a source said. \"Khaire, instead of introspection, has been blaming the BJP for his defeat. He suspects the BJP supported Harshvardhan Jadhav, an ex-Sena man and son-in-law of the party\u2019s state unit president Raosaheb Danve (also the Union minister of food and civil supplies), to ensure his defeat. But that is not true. Khaire lost because of his bad performance,\u2019\u2019 another BJP leader said.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The announcement was made during the committee chairman Jamal Siddiqui\u2019s visit to Aurangabad on Sunday. He was touring the city and adjoining areas to review preparations for the pilgrimage scheduled for August this year. \u201cAfter fulfilling the Haj-related responsibility, we will start affordable Umrah services for the pilgrims from the state,\u201d he said This year India\u2019s Haj quota has been increased by 25,000, taking the total number of pilgrims from India to 2 lakh, out of which 1.4 lakh go through the Haj committee, while the remaining through different private tour operators (PTOs). While in the case of Umrah, all the pilgrims are sent through PTOs. According to those who are in this business, more pilgrims go on Umrah than on Haj each year. Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam, in which the rituals are performed over five days in and around Mecca. Compared to this, Umrah, which is termed as mini pilgrimage, is optional and can be performed any time throughout the year. Usually, Umrah tours range from five to 40 days. During the Haj season, the pilgrims who want to perform only Umrah are not allowed. Haj Committee of India was formed in the 2002 through a central parliamentary Act. In this Act there is a provision formation of subsequent Haj committees in each state for assisting the central committee. The basic responsibilities of the state Haj committees include collecting forms, training pilgrims, providing facilities at embarkation points, coordination with the central Haj committee and so on. The authorities maintained that even if the state decides to start Umrah services, it will have to wait for the amendment in the Act. Incumbent CEO of the state Haj committee Maqsood Khan told TOI, \u201cIn the present Act, there is no provision of sending pilgrims to Umrah. Though in the revised policy, which was published 2018, it was intended to start Umrah services, but it did not materialise as there is no provision about it in the Act.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "time": "2019-06-17 04:15:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/now-state-haj-committee-to-start-umrah-services/articleshow/69816228.cms"}}
