The deceased were identified as Kanna Vara Prasad (22) and Sunkara Adinarayana (50), both victims of a road accident. While Vara Prasad was admitted to the hospital on June 9, Adinarayana was admitted on June 11. Both had head injuries and were put on ventilators. They died around 9:15 pm on Wednesday. Family members of the deceased and other patients in the trauma care ward alleged that the ventilators went off with the power outage and the generator was switched after ten minutes. Speaking to TOI, V Siva Ramakrishna, Vara Prasad\u2019s maternal uncle, said that power went off in the hospital around 9:15 pm after some gusty wind. \u201cIt was total darkness in the trauma care unit and the ventilator machines also went off. We looked for the nurses and support staff but could not find them. We ran from pillar to post to request them to switch on the generator. It took them ten minutes to turn the generator on but by that time, my nephew had died,\u201d he alleged. Relatives of Vara Prasad staged a protest at the hospital, demanding action against negligent staffers. Sunkara Adinarayana who was being treated on the adjacent bed to Vara Prasad also died at the same time. Hospital authorities gave intimation of death to the police at 9:30 pm. GGH superintendent Dr S Babulal denied the allegation that the deaths took place due to a power outage. He said that the ventilators come with an automatic power backup that lasts for six hours. \u201cEven if there was a delay in switching on the generator, ventilators do not have any problem as they draw from the backup. The deaths took place only because of the medical condition of the patients. The timing was a mere coincidence,\u201d he claimed. \u201cWe have 12 ventilators in the hospital and seven people are being treated on them. Of the seven, two died on Wednesday,\u201d Babulal added. However, Siva Ramakrishna refuted the argument of hospital authorities and demanded for an inquiry to check the ventilators at the trauma care ward. He said two of three patients in the ward died when the power went off. Balakrishna, the third patient in the trauma care ward, also said that the ventilator machines went off during power outage. Siva Ramakrishna lodged a complaint with Machavaram police alleging negligence by hospital staff that caused the death of his nephew. A case has been registered.

Since taking charge of the crucial ministry, Buggana has been holding review meetings with all department heads to know the state\u2019s present financial situation. \u201cI have just started looking at the finances, and it has shocked me. The previous government completely mismanaged the state\u2019s finances. Though the CAG had warned about the financial mismanagement, the earlier government never paid heed to it. The exchequer is now empty,\u201d he said. The minister further alleged that while the previous government diverted funds from every account, the expenditure was mostly unwarranted. \u201cA big portion of the state\u2019s funds was spent on publicity and other works. Funds from various departments were pooled up and spent on tours and events,\u201d he said, adding that he would require some more time to get to know the actual position of the state\u2019s finances. \u201cMany things need to be readjusted to meet the needs of all departments, and the promises made to people.\u201d The first priority of the government is to cut down on wasteful expenditure, the finance minister said. \u201cMoney not spent on extravagance is money earned.

We are committed to bring down the expenditure. Chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy set the tone by going for a simple swearing-in ceremony and also for the swearing-in of the new cabinet (on June 8).

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

As the government is considering to increase liquor prices to make it unaffordable, margin on liquor sales is likely to be increased compensating the corresponding losses in volumes, according to reliable sources in the excise department. The state government is earning nearly Rs 7,000 crore revenue on liquor sales with an average 16 per cent year-on-year growth. There are about 4,402 wine shops and 826 bars across the state which do retail liquor sales. On the other hand, each wine shop is having eight to 10 belt shops which do illegal sales of liquor especially in rural and sub-urban areas. Now with the new government taking the decision to eradicate all belt shops and also to downsize the number of liquor outlets, the sales volumes are likely to get affected. However, this reduction in number of shops may not affect revenues in the first year, said a senior official on condition of anonymity. As the liquor policy is likely to be tweaked every year to downsize the number of outlets to impose complete liquor ban in next five years, revenues will come down from the second year. The increase in liquor prices, however, will give a one-year window for the government to compensate revenue loss and look for alternative sources. On the other hand, many liquor shop owners are also looking to come out of the trade as the state government\u2019s decision is not favourable to them as they expect tighter norms in the upcoming policy. With the reduction of margins in the previous policy, many of them had ended up in losses.

According to energy minister B Srinivasa Reddy, power utilities are preparing modalities to begin the prestigious scheme. The state has 18.15 lakh pumpsets and 6,663 agriculture feeders. Of them, 4,951 feeders are ready for the nine-hour scheme. Keeping in view Tuesday\u2019s meeting on the modalities of the nine-hour supply, the minister held a teleconference on Sunday. The state has proposed tariffs at Rs 1.50 a unit for aqua farmers, free power to SC, ST colonies up to 200 units a month, and Rs 12,500 to each farmer towards input cost.

Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

In Kolkata on Sunday, the agitating doctors said they were ready to meet Mamata Banerjee \"anytime and anywhere\". The government proposed a 3pm meeting at the state secretariat on Monday. The doctors were reportedly ready to accept the proposal. IMA strike to cripple OPDs todayEarlier, the junior doctors had insisted that the meeting cannot be held behind closed doors and the media should be allowed to telecast it live. The state government, however, cited legalities and constitutional propriety, which prevent such meetings from being held under public glare. The doctors were ready to accept the government's request, sources indicated late Sunday, which would pave the way for \"across-the-table\" discussions between the protesters and the chief minister. \"We are very hopeful for the meeting in Nabanna (state secretariat) on Monday,\" a senior official, mediating for the state, said. \"We have explained to them that given the issues involved, mainly legal, administrative and security-related, it is impossible for the state government to agree to their demand for an open-door meeting in presence of the media. The CM is also sworn to an oath of secrecy in some such matters. We have explained they have every right to speak to media afterwards, much like the norm in all such cases. They have agreed to it,\" he said. Under pressure from several quarters, including the seniors in the medical fraternity, the junior doctors in Kolkata held a four-hour general body meeting at NRS Hospital. The meeting appeared to split three ways. While a section of doctors agreed to have the meeting at Nabanna, another section stressed on Raj Bhavan as the venue, while the remaining stuck to their demand for NRS Hospital. Pressure further mounted on the striking doctors to find a solution to the standoff. At 3.30pm, a group of doctors announced their stand. \"We are hopeful that our CM will be considerate enough to solve the problems that the state is facing in the healthcare sector currently,\" they said in a statement while refusing to accept any question from the media. \"We leave the decision to choose the venue to the honourable CM, but it should accommodate representatives of all medical colleges of West Bengal in sufficient numbers,\" the statement read.

However, it was not to be. The attempts of the RWS to revive the borewells have also gone in vain as water could not be tapped even at the depth of 1,000ft.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

He said that traders should keep the dire straits of the farmers and pick up the stocks at higher prices. On Friday, Kannababu held a meeting with representatives of tobacco traders and farmers Minister following the instructions of chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy. The minister pointed out that it was not proper on the part of traders to be reluctant in picking up stocks in peak season. \u201cYou might be having problems in offering high prices due to poor export orders. However, you should not undermine the unrest among farmers as it would permanently hit the trade,\u201d Kannababu advised. He asked the tobacco industry to take small losses in their stride if needed to provide remunerative prices to the growers, particularly those who grow low-grade varieties. He insisted that the prices should not go down further from the prevailing Rs 85 per kg. Former MP Yalamanchili Sivaji said that traders have deliberately slowed down purchases only to offer low prices. He said that growers could not survive unless they were paid at least Rs 120 per kg for the low grades. Farmers alleged that big players were exerting pressure on small merchants to abstain from the market and this was the reason why prices were getting low. ITC CEO Sanji Rangrass said that the stocks being brought by the farmers in the SLS (southern light soil) region were of very low quality and increasing prices could be a tough ask. Indian Tobacco Association (ITA) president Mittapalli Umaamaheswara Rao, on his part, said that there was no demand for low grade varieties in the export market and offering more than Rs 80 per kg was unviable for them. He said that traders were suffering huge losses due to the purchase of inferior quality stocks.

This is nearly Rs 15,000 crore additional grant to the allocation made in the vote-on-account budget. The agriculture department has already submitted its draft report to the finance department, which has begun preparing the budget. \u201cCM Jagan wanted farmers\u2019 welfare to be the priority of the government. Allocations in the budget will be in line with our CM\u2019s vision,\u201d said minister of animal husbandry, fisheries and marketing Mopidevi Venkata Ramana. According to the initial proposals readied by the agriculture department, about Rs 8,500 crore will be needed to implement the YSR Rythu Bharosa. According to the scheme, the state government has assured to grant Rs 12,500 to each farmer in the state ahead of the Rabi season in October. Sources said that the chief minister has already directed the agriculture department to include tenant farmers under the scheme. Meanwhile, in order to implement the scheme the state government has already scrapped the Chandrababu Naidu government\u2019s Annadata Sukhibhava scheme, which promised to grant Rs 9,000 per year to small and marginal farmers. As per official data, about 60.5 lakh farmers have been identified in the state who own land and there are another 7.5 lakh tenant farmers. Hence, the department has estimated that financial assistance will have to be extended to nearly 68 lakh farmers, for which it will need Rs 8,500 crore. Apart from this the government has promised to pay, on behalf of the farmers, the interest on a loan of Rs 1 lakh. The department has demanded a Rs 4,000 crore for the interest free loans scheme. The state government has also promised to pay the total premium on agriculture insurance from the exchequer. The agriculture department has estimated that it would require another Rs 2,000 crore to pay the premium. Besides agriculture, for the dairy industry, Ramana said, the government has already signed the proposal to increase the milk procurement price by Rs 4 per litre with immediate effect. This scheme would require at least Rs 200 crore for its implementation. \u201cWe are committed to implementing each and every promise made during Jagan\u2019s padayatra and is part of Nava Rathnalu. We will make every effort to spare funds for the hassle-free implementation of the schemes in spite of severe financial crisis,\u201d said agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added.

The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught.

Asked about Congress' Delhi unit president Sheila Dikshit's remarks that Kejriwal never approached her for an alliance, the chief minister said, \u201cWe have met Rahul Gandhi. Dikshit is not that important leader.\u201d Kejriwal has been urging the Congress to stitch an alliance in Delhi for the Lok Sabha polls to keep the BJP away from power. Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.

An increase in the number of industries on the outskirts of the city and unscientific treatment of industrial waste at Jawahar Autonagar and other industrial estates are major factors for the high levels of particulate matter-10 (PM-10) in the city. The Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB), which carried out a study on the reasons behind high PM-10 levels found that furnaces and industries using coal and petroleum coke (\u2018petcoke\u2019) as fuel were causing severe damage to air quality. Jawahar Autonagar is the largest industrial estate in Andhra Pradesh, comprising over 6,000 industries, mainly in the automotive and steel molding sectors, which depend on petcoke and coal as fuel for the furnaces. The estate employs around 2.5 lakh people, who work in these polluted and unhygienic conditions. There is no proper coordination between Jawahar Autonagar and the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) when it comes to handling solid waste, with workers alleging that staff of the Industrial Area Local Authority (IALA) can be seen burning toxic industrial waste. \u201cThere is no door-to-door garbage collection in Autonagar. Authorities of the IALA are ignoring public health. The VMC imposes penalties for burning solid waste, while IALA workers burn hazardous industrial waste daily,\u201d said Bandi Samuel Raj, who runs a tyre retreading company. Meanwhile, severe respiratory disorders have become common in Jawahar Autonagar but the IALA has no action plan yet to handle this. \u201cThe chairman and commissioner of IALA are not bothered about the pollution. The main road connecting Autonagar with Ramavarappadu has become a hub for burning industrial waste. Fumes emitted by burning garbage cause bronchitis and other allergies among residents. Residents of Kanuru, Sanath Nagar and Currency Nagar have been affected due to air pollution from Auto Nagar,\u201d said KMV Rama Rao, who leads a trade union in the estate. Pulmonologists warn that inhaling toxic fumes will severely damage one\u2019s health. \u201cThe smell of rotten eggs is quite common in Autonagar, which is nothing but burning sulphur. Inhaling these fumes will cause respiratory problems in the long run and may increase the chance of cancers and heart diseases,\u201d said Dr BV Mohana Rao, a pulmonologist. APPCB has said it is preparing long-term as well as short-term plans to handle air pollution. \u201cWe are preparing and implementing local area action plan for pollution hotspots and enforcement of air pollution control measures in all industries, including in unauthorised areas. We will use continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) data for enforcement and legal compliance monitoring,\u201d said BSS Prasad, APPCB chairman.
