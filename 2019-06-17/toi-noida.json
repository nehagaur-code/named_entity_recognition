The development authority will place a proposal at its June 25 board meeting to charge cess only on extra construction rather than the whole covered area, acknowledging it\u2019s an anomaly that needs to be removed. Since 2014, the GDA has been charging metro cess from buyers in the impact zone of the Dilshad Garden-New Bus Adda metro corridor (the Red Line extension that was commissioned earlier this year). The impact zone extends to 500 metres on either side of the corridor. The cess charged is 15% of difference between the circle rates of 2012 and 2013.

If implemented, this will lead to a steep increase in power bills \u2014 a monthly bill of, say, Rs 3,000 will rise to around Rs 4,000. In the tariff proposal submitted to UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC), UPPCL has recommended the highest increase of 26% in the lowest slab of 0-150 units, raising it from Rs 4.90 per unit to Rs 6.20. The tariff for the 151-300 units slab is proposed to be hiked from Rs 5.40 to Rs 6.50 per unit. Similarly, urban households consuming 301 to 500 units per month will have to shell out Rs 7 per unit instead of Rs 6.20, and those with consumption higher than 500 units will have to pay Rs 7.50 per unit. Sources in UPERC said there will be a public hearing and, as per procedure, a public notice will be issued inviting objections from people. Principal secretary (energy) Alok Kumar said the hike was proposed in view of the rise in input cost of power. \u201cThere has been an increase in the cost of coal and fuel. The cost of maintaining transmission and generation infrastructure has also gone up,\u201d he told TOI. The last power tariff hike of around 12% was implemented in 2017, six months after BJP stormed to power in UP with an overwhelming majority. There was no tariff hike in 2018. Not surprisingly, the proposed hike has raised hackles of consumers. UP Rajya Upbhogta Parishad president A K Verma said that proposed hike was extremely high. \u201cThe power corporation has been putting the burden on consumers to hide its own inefficiency,\u201d he said.

Noida is a profit-making centre and an increase in charges will be completely unjustified,\u201d said A N Dhawan, secretary general of FONRWA, the umbrella body of RWAs in the city. He also said FONRWA had already written to the UPERC to declare Noida a profit centre and reduce tariff. \u201cThe power department is already unable to provide the required amount of electricity in Noida, while there is full recovery and good revenue from here.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

According to the police, the accused carried out the robberies in Bisrakh, Surajpur and near Greater Noida police station within a week. \u201cThey booked all the cabs from Vijay nagar to reach Greater Noida and used mobiles stolen from the drivers,\u201d said Vaibhav Krishna, SSP, Gautam Budh Nagar. On May 30, the gang booked a Swift Dzire from Vijay Nagar. Before reaching Bisrakh, the assailants took over the vehicle from the driver, Gautam. \u201cThey pushed me to the back seat and also tied my hands and legs. They were taking the car to a secluded area, but it ran out of fuel. They took Rs 4,000 cash, my phone and car keys from me and fled leaving the car behind,\u201d said Gautam in his complaint lodged at Bisrakh police station. The accused men used mobile phone to book another cab on June 5. After boarding the Tata Zest from Vijay Nagar the assailants snatched it from the driver near Tilpata roundabout. \u201cThe accused took the car along with cash and the driver\u2019s mobile phone. An FIR was registered in Surajpur police station,\u201d said Krishna. The third robbery occurred two days later, when a cab driver named Virendra Singh filed a complaint alleging that he was robbed of his IndigoCS by three men near Sirsa roundabout. Police said they observed a pattern in the three robberies and realised that all of them were conducted by the same gang. \u201cWe nabbed them near Roja Jalalpur roundabout on Saturday morning. The accused confessed to the crime. We recovered six mobile phones, a purse, two Aadhaar cards, a PAN card, and two vehicles from their possession,\u201d said Krishna. The officer further added that the mastermind of the gang was Deepak, who was wanted in a dozen cases of robbery and was released from jail a month ago.

How to make them safer?": {"time": "2019-06-13 12:03:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/survey-finds-35-spots-most-prone-to-accidents-how-to-make-them-safer/articleshow/69763736.cms", "description": "NOIDA: The transport department has written to all authorities, including traffic police and public works department (PWD), after the road safety committee of the district administration identified 35 black spots in Gautam Budh Nagar. It has asked the authorities to visit the places and suggest rectification measures. The black spots were identified in February this year based on guidelines issued by the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH). Any stretch of about 500m, where either five crashes have taken place, or 10 fatalities have occurred in the past three years, is considered a black spot. Officials said the major cause of accidents at nearly all these spots is speeding, and most of the spots are along the expressway. All departments are expected to jointly inspect the sites by the end of the week. The solutions will be discussed in a road safety committee meeting on June 19. The committee includes officials from the transport department, traffic police, all three authorities, PWD, district administration, UPSRTC, and a few other departments. \u201cWe have written to the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) and PWD to visit these areas and provide short-term as well as long term solutions. These will be discussed during the meeting,\u201d said Himesh Tiwary, the assistant regional transport officer. \u201cSince there are many black spots along the expressway and most accidents occur due to speeding, we need specialised solutions to control speeding. We can\u2019t put speed breakers on these stretches. We can discuss putting signage and boards displaying the number of accidents at that spot to make people aware,\u201d Tiwary added. Some of the black spots include Rajnigandha Chowk, DND Flyway near Sector 15A, Mahamaya flyover, the zero points of Noida-Greater Noida Expressway as well as Yamuna Expressway, Sector 5 intersection, Gijhore intersection, Sector 137, Sector 82 intersection, NSEZ, Nangla bus stand, BPL intersection, Yamaha Chowk, Tilpata roundabout, LG roundabout, Sector Pi 3 Chowk, Jagat Farm, ATS Chowk and Jewar toll plaza. Of the 35 black spots, speeding is the major cause for crashes at 32. Rash driving and driving on the wrong side are the other reasons behind a high number of accidents. The road safety committee had identified 11 black spots three years ago in 2016, all of which were rectified, according to officials. The new list of black spots is more than three times the previous list. Officials said this is because of an increase in population in the two cities in the past few years. \u201cLakhs of people have settled in parts of Noida and Greater Noida in the past few years, which has led to a sudden rise in the number of vehicles. It is important for us to review road engineering in several places considering the increasing traffic. Most of these roads were designed for handling lesser traffic volume,\u201d said Anil Kumar Jha, superintendent of police (traffic).

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Although Noida Authority had asked Delhi Metro and Noida Metro in April to clear the drains, officials said, the situation cannot be changed now as construction of a new underpass will also begin near sectors 51 and 52 metro stations. In case of waterlogging this year, it will only be pumped out as a temporary fix, they said. \u201cWe had written to both Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) in April to remove the blockage around drains in sectors 51, 52, 71 and 72. These were filled with concrete and the pipeline was blocked during construction work. Anyway, we are waiting for them to take action,\u201d SC Gupta, senior manager of Noida Authority, told TOI. Officials, however, said that \u201clittle action is expected as construction of a new underpass will also begin soon at Sector 71 intersection near sectors 51 and 52 metro stations\u201d. Additionally, a commercial plot between both the metro stations will soon be auctioned. \u201cAnd, if construction on the commercial plot also begins, it will have to work on the drainage system too.

The project, which is seeing the four-lane NH-24 (now renamed NH-9) being upgraded into a 14-lane highway, has moved at a slower pace than the NHAI expected in this 8km stretch that has Noida and Indirapuram on either side. The latest completion target is July, which also looks difficult to meet because work on the main expressway corridor \u2014 which is the access-controlled six-lane portion of the 14-lane highway \u2014 hasn\u2019t begun in some parts. This includes the UP Gate and Khoda area where a bridge also needs to be built over the Hindon canal. NHAI project director R P Singh said construction work for the entire 19.2km Phase 2 package (from UP Gate to Dasna, Phase 1 was in Delhi from Sarai Kale Khan to UP Gate) is around 52% complete. And the stretch between UP Gate and Vijay Nagar is about 55% complete, which means it\u2019s just over the halfway mark. This stretch also has seven full-fledged underpasses and three smaller ones for light vehicles. \u201cThe delay has been attributed to shifting of transmission lines at three points on the stretch.

While Bhati surrendered before a local court last week, police said they are now on the lookout for the absconding directors. Bhati floated a Ponzi scheme under the name Bike Bot, and allegedly netted a whopping 2.5 lakh investors within a few months. Of the 10 new complainants, all from Rajasthan, five have alleged that they were duped of over Rs 3 crore by the company, with only one instalment of the promised Rs 9,756 per month being deposited in their account. These fresh complaints, cops said, will be clubbed with the existing FIRs, over 30, against Bhati and others that are being probed by a special investigative team (SIT). In their complaint handed over to the SP (rural), these five investors \u2014 Govind Sahay, Jyoti Joshi, Jitendra Kumar, Jaswant Yadav and Kamal Yadav \u2014 have named nine others, including Rajesh Bhardwaj, Sunil Prajapati, Deepti Bahl, Sachin Bhati and Karanpal Singh, apart from Bhati. According to police sources, while Sachin is Sanjay Bhati\u2019s brother, Deepti is his wife and the others are his associates. Police obtained a five-day remand of Sanjay Bhati after he was produced in Surajpur court on Wednesday. SP (rural) Vineet Jaiswal told TOI, \u201cHe will have to be sent back to judicial custody on June 17.\u201d Inspector Sunil Negi, who is part of the investigative team, said Bhati had urged the court to allow him not to be handcuffed whenever he was produced as he was \u201can educated and reputable person\u201d. When Bhati arrived on the premises of the SSP\u2019s office in a police vehicle on Thursday, angry words were exchanged between him and some investors who had gathered there. Bhati had surrendered in court on June 7 while police were addressing a press conference about the arrest of the company\u2019s franchise head Vijay Kasana. Kasana was arrested after some investors informed police he had met with an accident and was admitted at a private hospital in Meerut. Bike Bot was floated as an enterprise with an app of the same name under the parent company, Garvit Innovative Promoters, in 2017. It sought a one-time investment of Rs 65,100 from investors, offering monthly returns of Rs 9,765. The money, investors were told, would come from revenue generated by bike taxis affiliated to Bike Bot in various cities. The scam came to light when the Bike Bot began defaulting on returns in 2018. Bhati, formerly associated with BSP, and other officials of Bike Bot had been on the run for six months before he surrendered.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

Officials said that while metro corporations run training programmes for employees, they are not able to get trained manpower, as no specialised courses are available in the country that train students for metro operations. Most metro staff members from across the country are trained, after they are hired, either at the DMRC training centre in Delhi or Namma metro centre in Bangalore. \u201cWe spend almost a year training our staff in the various metro operations because there is no metro specialisation available for students in the country. We get railway engineers and others from IT, communications and other streams and then train them. The new course will benefit us and several other metro networks that are being developed,\u201d said P D Upadhyay, the executive director, NMRC. With metro rail operational in 12 cities, and several others at construction stage, the university hopes that there will be increased demand for trained employees. Nearly 600 km of sanctioned metro lines is under construction and is expected to be ready in the next five years, according to the Government of India. There are about 1,000 km of metro line proposals under planning. \u201cWe have held round tables with various metro corporations and private infrastructure companies and realised that there is a huge gap in the demand and supply for engineers trained in metro operations. Most metro systems initially higher engineers from outside the country for starting the system. Therefore, we have decided to introduce a new course this year for MTech in railway signalling, telecom and reliability availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS),\u201d said B P Sharma, vice chancellor, GBU. He added that the course will focus on metro operations in each module and a separate certificate for it will also be given at the end of the course. The syllabus, possible modules and other structures have been developed in consultation with various metro rail corporations. Additionally, a four-week summer internship will also be conducted for students with practical training at the NMRC stations. \u201cThere are hardly any colleges that provide training in RAMS and nobody gives special training for metro. Most students who take up RAMS and railway engineering move to countries like Saudi Arabia and work for the metro system there. The new course will help supply trained officials for metro systems in India,\u201d said Vidushi Sharma, a member of GBU\u2019s joint consultative committee on Centre for rapid alternative energy and mobility. The NMRC is helping with developing the course structure and providing faculty from within the industry. Most of the trainers and teachers will be retired or working officials.. \u201cThe NMRC will also help with providing on-the-job training to the students at its metro stations and depots. Our senior staff members will teach the students,\u201d Upadhyay said. An agreement will be signed between GBU and NMRC within a week, officials said. The NMRC already has a staff strength of about 690 and will need another 200 employees in the next six months because of the ongoing expansion work.

But it has so many fans, I\u2019m sure it can do with one less. \u2018Don\u2019t usually have time to watch cricket, but will make time today\u2019Ashvarya Sharma, homemaker, 52, DelhiIt\u2019s not that I hate cricket but since I am a homemaker, I have to keep running around doing chores and can\u2019t spend the whole day sitting and watching cricket. But TV pe bhi toh wahi chalta hai din bhar toh dekhna hi padta hai. However, the India-Pakistan game is different. I watch it by choice. It\u2019s not just cricket; it\u2019s almost war-like. The sentiment is different. In fact, today I plan to finish my chores early. Kitchen ki bhi chutti hai uss din. I don't miss a single ball of any India-Pakistan match. \u2018Will watch the match because it is the patriotic thing to do\u2019Ananya Pandey, communication professional, 29, DelhiI really never had anyone in my family who was an ardent cricket fan or watched it for fun, so I never found any company to watch the game or develop a taste for it. The last game I watched was the 2011 World Cup final that India won. I watched because it was a special occasion and it felt like the patriotic thing to do. Similarly, I will watch the India-Pakistan match today because it\u2019s a different rush altogether. As clich\u00e9d as it may sound, as an Indian, any Indo-Pak discussion catches my attention. Specially post the Pulwama attack and the increasing political tensions, I\u2019d like to see how this tension will affect the performances of both the teams. Also, on a lighter note, my boss \u2013 a die-hard cricket fan \u2013 has instructed me to watch this match and cheer for India. 'After balakot strike, anything India-Pak will attract me'Rajat Kothari, banker, 38, NoidaI don\u2019t follow cricket but an India-Pakistan game is not cricket. I don\u2019t understand the rules and the jargon of cricket and prefer football, to be honest. At least, it\u2019s played by more than a dozen countries in the world. But when I will sit with my friends and family to watch the game today, I won\u2019t be watching cricket, I feel I will be supporting India against Pakistan, on all fronts. After the skirmishes recently and the Balakot Air Strike, the atmosphere is such that anything India-Pakistan will attract my attention. This will be my first ever cricket match and I hope India wins. \u2018The only way to socialise today\u2019Ishita Mathur, teacher, 22, GhaziabadI will watch it because it\u2019s a great way to socialise. Today, cricket will be the only topic of conversation. It just doesn\u2019t seem right to ignore that or not be a part of the discourse. So, I will join my family in front of the TV today and watch the game. The reason I don\u2019t watch cricket is because I find it boring. I prefer other team sports like football and basketball. They seem more participative and active. In cricket, it seems only the bowler and batsmen are doing something at a given time while the others are passively involved. 'Flatmates will suck me into the frenzy'Tsering Tashi, research scholar, 29, DelhiI will have to watch it. What else do you do when everyone around you is crazy about it? I live in a flat with three other cricket-crazy boys and they will watch the game. So, I will be party to the frenzy. I grew up watching and playing football and for me, that is the beautiful game. Cricket is just a colonial hangover, not a sport. I have managed to avoid all the other India matches in the World Cup so far but the hype around the India-Pakistan match is such that you get sucked into the maelstrom somehow.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The protests came on a day the Gautam Budh Nagar district was felicitated by the UP government for collecting around Rs 14.8 crore in power revenue between October last year and this March, the highest in the state during the period. The district was followed by Ferozabad at Rs 9.6 crore and Mainpuri, which collected Rs 9.3 crore in the same period. GB Nagar\u2019s overall collection of power revenue for the financial year 2018-19 was also at an all-time high of Rs 103 crore, in comparison to Rs 64 crore collected in 2017-18. District magistrate BN Singh was felicitated with a gold certificate by chief secretary Anup Chandra Pandey for the highest revenue collection. \u201cCollection of revenue from power has been maximum at Rs 103 crore for the financial year 2018-19, as against Rs 64 crore in 2017-18. This award is in recognition of such steep collection,\u201d said Singh, the district magistrate. Residents, however, protested the plan to increase tariff and called for an upgrade in power infrastructure. \u201cWe welcome the felicitation of the district for collecting the highest revenue. But we are completely opposed to the proposed 20% hike in power tariff for the simple reason that we have been facing long outages of late in Noida and Greater Noida. There has been lack of upgraded infrastructure and accountability on the part of the power department in the district. Despite paying hefty bills, we are facing 4-8 hours of power cuts every day. How can a tariff hike be justified in a situation where the power department is unable to provide regular supply?\u201d asked NP Singh, president of the Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA). Apart from the 20% increase in power tariff across slabs, the UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) has also suggested a hike in the fixed charge from Rs 90 per KW to Rs 110. If implemented, this will lead to a steep increase in power bills \u2014 a monthly bill of, say, Rs 3,000 will rise to around Rs 4,000. In the tariff proposal submitted to UP Electricity Regulatory Commission, UPPCL has recommended the highest increase of 26% in the lowest slab of 0-150 units, raising it from Rs 4.90 per unit to Rs 6.20. The tariff for the 151-300 units slab is proposed to be hiked from Rs 5.40 to Rs 6.50 per unit. According to the RWA federation president, the hike is all the more unjustified in a district that pays the highest revenue and steep electricity bills. \u201cNoida is a \u2018no power cut zone\u2019, which is required for promotion of industry. It\u2019s also an area which provides the maximum revenue. Then, why should it be subjected to a tariff hike? We oppose the proposal and will take up the matter with chief minister Yogi Adityanath. We will approach Prime Minister Narendra Modi, if needed,\u201d said NP Singh. Greater Noida resident Alok Kumar suggested that the power department should instead focus on laying underground cables, upgrading old transformers, replacing rusting poles, panel boxes and increasing load capacities of substations. \u201cWe congratulate the district magistrate for the felicitation in revenue collection, but strongly oppose the hike in tariff,\u201d said Kumar. District magistrate Singh maintained that the hike was in the proposal stage. \u201cThe tariff hike proposal pertains to the power department. Residents should raise their concerns regarding tariff etc with them or the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Committee. It does not fall under my jurisdiction,\u201d said Singh, adding that he was only authorised for revenue collection.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

He has alleged that the woman approached him for getting a PAN card issued and then got angry when it could not be done in a day. The sub-inspector allegedly took him to the police chowki and threatened to book him for rape. He had to pay Rs 5 lakh to get out of the situation, according to the complaint. The complainant, who is 50 years old, has claimed that he helped people to get their PAN cards issued. The woman, Vineeta Aggarwal, contacted him over phone in this regard on April 12, this year. \u201cShe insisted that her PAN card had to be provided instantly. I saw her receipt, which was dated April 11, and informed her that the PAN card would be sent to her address directly within a week. At this, she got angry and started fighting, asking why she was called to the office if the PAN card could not be issued immediately. She threatened that she would complain about me and get me locked up at the chowki,\u201d the complaint said. The next day, the Sector 44 chowki in-charge, sub-inspector Sunil Sharma, arrived at his house with the woman and a few constables in two vehicles. He allegedly insulted the complainant and dragged him to the chowki where he was threatened to be booked under IPC 376 (rape). Then he was allegedly asked to pay Rs 10 lakh. \u201cI asked them where I could get so much money and that I did not have any sexual contact with the woman,\u201d the complaint said. The matter was finally settled for Rs 5 lakh. Earlier, a police team, led by the Noida SSP, caught three constables, posted with the Sector 44 chowki, as they were taking extortion money from a victim and the sub-inspector was held after they named him. It was revealed that they, along with three PCR van drivers and eight other persons, were running a racket, targetting rich businessmen. The two women in the gang would seek a lift from their targets in the Sector 44 area and ask to be dropped at a spot where a PCR van would be parked. They would then complain to the constables in the van that they had been raped by the target and demand that a case be filed against him. Next, the target would be taken to the police chowki, where they had to pay money to resolve the situation and get their vehicle back. On Tuesday, all the accused were booked and sent to jail. Now, a second FIR has been filed against Sharma and the accused woman under IPC 384 (extortion). But police do not have details about the complainant yet. Sector 39 SHO Rajesh Sharma said that the FIR was lodged under directions from senior police officers and the complainant\u2019s profile would be checked during the investigation. Gautam Budh Nagar SSP Vaibhav Krishna said that the complainant did not share his details because he was afraid that his image would be tarnished. \u201cThere are at least two more complainants who have come to forward,\u201d he added.

Fines ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh have been imposed on the schools depending on the violations. Of these institutions, eight have been slapped a fine of Rs 75,000 each for not uploading a full declaration of their fee structure on the websites. Thirty-one schools were called by the DFRC for a meeting at the camp office of the district magistrate at Sector 27 on Saturday. The meeting that lasted from 11 am to 2pm was attended by parents, school representatives and DFRC members. Jagran Public School, which did not turn up for the meeting, was slapped a fine of Rs 1 lakh for not turning up. Earlier, the DFRC had served notices to the 31 schools for violating the Fee Regulation Act. After the meeting, PK Upadhyay, the district inspector of schools, said: \u201cThe committee has taken strict cognisance of complaints and have issued heavy fines. No school will be allowed to bypass the UP Fee regulation Act. All schools were heard and the act was explained to them thoroughly.\u201d Parents of children studying in these schools had complained about mid-session fee hike, directions from the schools regarding mandatory purchase of books from the institutions and change in uniforms. Some schools were asked to roll back the increased fee. \u201cWe are happy with the action taken by DFRC and that it held the schools accountable for the violations.

Not true, say hands-on new-age dads": {"datetime": "", "description": "Fathers can\u2019t multitask, can\u2019t cook, manage household chores along with their work, or can\u2019t balance their professional lives with the personal ones \u2013 these are just some stereotypes that we have grown up hearing. But the new-age dads, who stay in nuclear as well as joint families, where both husband and wife are working, are not only dividing the task of raising kids equally, but also making sure that they are available for their kids for a heart-to-heart conversation, advice on friendships, or period talks. From taking leaves for kids\u2019 exams to cooking and helping them with homework \u2013 things that one would typically expect a mother would do \u2013 are being done by dads quite well, who believe in not just sharing finances, but other responsibilities, too. On Father\u2019s Day, we speak to some dads and mothers leading by example, who tell us about the stereotypes that fathers are subjected to, and how they are breaking them and contributing as an equal parent. Dads not emotional, says who?Ankur Gupta, a doctor and resident of Sector 50, Gurgaon, says, \u201cFathers are not sensitive, kids turn to their mothers if they want to express their feelings; fathers are messy, don\u2019t help in household chores; they are not interested in school grades, and are uncomfortable in parent-teacher meetings \u2013 these are some common stereotypes that most fathers in India are subjected to. Thankfully, these are not applicable to me as at a very early age my daughter realised that she could walk up to me and talk about anything that is bothering her emotionally. I am also interested in knowing about what is happening in her school. There is no division of labour at our home but my wife and I know about the things we are good at, so we take the lead accordingly. I know I am good at language and my wife can manage the finances well, so it is like an unsaid rule that we follow to help our family in that way.\u201d Tilak Chowdhury, a resident of Sector 169, Noida, who works at a consulting firm, adds, \u201cThe stereotypes are not restricted to just, dads can\u2019t cook or look after the kids, often, they are also considered very strict and someone who cannot have fun, or show any emotion in front of their kids. Why can\u2019t people expect a father to be like Anupam Kher\u2019s character in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge who can encourage his kids when they fail, or do not perform well in studies, or can discuss their love lives openly like Rishi Kapoor\u2019s character in Hum Tum?\u201d Can\u2019t discuss heartbreaks with dads \u2013 seriously? You cannot discuss problems related to heartbreaks or seek advice after a fight with friends with your father as they won\u2019t understand them \u2013 new-age dads are trying to break this stereotype. \u201cWe understand and can give useful advice to the kids. Why do people find it so difficult to accept that fathers can also have emotions and kids can have a conversation with us on topics related to heartbreaks or can seek any other emotional advice? I have always been available to my kids whenever they have wanted me. I remember that my elder daughter, now 15, would return disturbed from school. One day, I asked her about what was bothering her as I was concerned. I did not mean to interfere in her personal life, but I told her that she could come up to me whenever she was comfortable talk about it, and I would try to help her in all my capacity. It took her two days to tell me that she was facing problems with a friend, who would often fight with her on petty issues. I told her that it was important to focus on the friendship if it was important to them, they can fight over petty issues but school days won\u2019t come back. We started with this topic and then she opened up about her school life and her friends from the neighbourhood. I was glad that she could tell me everything. That day, my daughter understood that she can discuss her problems with me and I will try to help her,\u201d shares Arjun Singh, a businessman who lives in Rajouri Garden and father to two teenage daughters. Arpana Prakash, who runs a dance school, adds, \u201cWhen I asked my seven-year-old daughter about who would she first tell about her boyfriend, and she said, \u2018Dad.\u2019 That is the comfort level that they share. We could never think about having a talk about menstruation with our fathers but today\u2019s generation surely can.\u201d \u2018Can take care of kids and deal with clients\u2019Raj Hazarika says that he is often asked why he willingly contributes as a homemaker. \u201cThis is something that they expect a woman to do but I like cooking and also enjoy doing it for my kids. Playing, cooking or just being with my kids is important as they are growing up, and this time will never come back. Raising kids is not an easy task, and there is nothing wrong in being equally involved with your partner in doing so. One has to adjust a lot while dealing with kids. I can manage my clients or colleagues easily but dealing with kids and their temperament is another thing \u2013 something that every parent should learn hands- on,\u201d says Raj, a resident of Sushant Lok 2 who runs a coaching academy. For some, it is also a way to bond with their kids. \u201cMy wife is a teacher and she leaves around 6.30am, so I wake up early before my kids leave for school and pack their lunch. I leave for work around 10am, so I have enough time to spend with my kids. We both are working parents, so I don\u2019t see it as a problem that I am cooking for my kids. When I come from work, my kids are often asleep because my wife is with them after school and helps them with the homework. If I have my Saturdays off, then I help them with their homework or extra-curricular activities but that is something I want to do as a parent, and not because somebody is forcing me to. People can think that I am too involved in my family but I am doing this because this is what I want to do,\u201d says Roshan Sharma, a resident of Saket, who works as a consultant in a firm.

The latest target, the Faridabad-based businessman, approached the SSP, saying his Honda City was being kept at the Sector 44 police chowki. The SSP said that the accused would take money of up to Rs six lakh from their targets. He added that the gang extorted money from as many as 15 people, but police have identified only three complainants, so far. Police have also recovered Rs 50,000, a Honda City car, a Verna car and a Grand i10 car from the accused. An FIR has been lodged against the accused under IPC sections 384 (punishment for extortion), 120b (criminal conspiracy), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) and Sections 7/13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act at the Sector 39 police station.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.
