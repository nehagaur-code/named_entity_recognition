Gaya remained the hottest place in the state on Sunday as the maximum temperature in the south Bihar town surged to 44.9 degrees C, six notches above normal. Dehri in Rohtas district also sizzled at 43.4 degrees C. In its weather forecast issued on Sunday, Patna Meteorological Centre stated that scorching heat conditions would prevail in the city at least till June 15 with maximum temperature hovering around 43- 44 degrees C. \u201cThe maximum temperature is expected to be five to six notches above normal in south-central and most parts of Bihar, except few north-eastern districts, over the next few days. This is basically due to hot and dry westerly winds which mix with moist easterly winds in different levels of atmosphere,\u201d said an official at Patna Meteorological Centre. \u201cThe distance between Sun and Earth is the least in June and July. The temperature, thus, remains highest during this time of the year,\u201d the official added. The normal date of onset of monsoon in Bihar through the north-eastern districts is June 10-12. However, the weathermen have claimed that the delay of one week in onset of monsoon over Kerala is likely to be translated in case of Bihar as well, and it may hit the state by June 20. The only silver lining is chances of southwest monsoon in north-eastern states over the next 24 hours. In its daily weather bulletin issued on Sunday evening, India Meteorological Centre stated that conditions were becoming favourable for advance of southwest monsoon into some parts of north-eastern states over the next 24 hours. Private weather agency Skymetweather also reported on Sunday that conditions were becoming favourable for southwest monsoon in some parts of the north-eastern states. It further stated that light to moderate rain with heavy spells would occur in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura during the coming days. According to officials at Patna Meteorological Centre, the wing of monsoon that enters north-eastern states through Bay of Bengal progresses over Bihar as well. Meanwhile, light rainfall occurred at one or two places in north-east Bihar during the last 24 hours.

Familiar sights of people wading through water completed the picture of misery in the run-up to the monsoon.

The India Meteorological Department's (IMD) Regional Meteorological Centre has warned that heavy rain is likely to occur at isolated places over Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on Saturday. Ahead of the arrival of the monsoon season, Friday's rainfall was of convective nature, said weathermen. \"It was moderate rainfall measuring 13 mm on the rain gauge in Guwahati.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

In Guwahati, the surface wind speed was 37 kmph, sometimes going up to 57 kmph, which the Regional Meteorological Centre said was the strongest for the day, but did not cause any major damage. Incessant rain since morning caused floods at several low lying areas in Guwahati forcing the Assam Power Distribution Company Limited to cut off electricity connections to avoid any mishaps. Cyclonic storm Fani has turned into a depression and its intensity is gradually on the decline, said deputy director general of meteorology at IMD's Regional Meteorological Centre in Guwahati, Sanjay O'Neill Shaw. An IMD bulletin in the evening said the depression over Bangladesh moved east-northeastwards with a speed of about 29 kmph in the last six hours and lay centred on 5.30pm over western Meghalaya and adjoining Bangladesh, about 110 km southeast of Dhubri and 130 km west-southwest of Guwahati. It is very likely to move northeastwards and weaken into a 'well marked low pressure area' in the next 12 hours. The Met office warned that Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Manipur will receive light to moderate rain at most places with isolated heavy to very heavy rain and extremely heavy rain in Assam, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh in the next 24 hours.

The Nagaland Integrated Waste Management Policy 2019 was enacted by the state government in February this year covers all urban and rural areas of the state, said deputy director in Urban Development department and Nodal Officer of Swachh Bharat Mission, Tarachu Fithu on Monday. He said the intention of the policy is to enable the community to reduce waste, reuse and recycle. As per the policy, waste management scenario in the state is still by and large rudimentary in the absence of proper policy or any regulatory mechanism. The urban areas comprising of 19 urban local bodies of the state, only Kohima has the scientific solid waste treatment plant located with 50 tonne per day (TDP) capacity. The rest of the urban local bodies have all landfill sites but they dump without any proper treatment. Waste production in the urban areas is about 342 TDP, the policy pointed. There are no collection systems at present in rural areas. But inherent practice of source segregation of wet waste for animal feed considerably reduces the problem of waste management, it said. The policy stated that some of the major issues faced in waste management, especially in the urban areas are the availability of land, manpower, machineries and resources at the disposal of the authorities. The policy stated that the Urban Development department shall ensure that all urban local bodies prepare action plan individually as to how they will manage their wastes. The Rural Development department shall ensure that all village councils prepared an action plan individually as to how they will manage their wastes.

The accused used to send an audio note to victims on WhatsApp. Through the note, they threatened the respondents with arrest because of an irregularity found in the social security number. The voice in the audio note would then share a helpline number where the victims were asked to call. The ones who fell for the trap, had to buy iTunes or Google Play gift cards, as instructed, and shared the secret code with the caller to \u2018settle\u2019 the issue.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party.

He said preventive measures have to be taken after dark since the pest can travel a distance of 100 km in a single night. \"This pest infestation has devastated the maize fields in the neighbouring states and Nagaland is also not far from suffering the same fate, if we do not take immediate action against it,\" the Deputy Director of the horticulture department, S Senka Jamir, said. The advisor for the horticulture department, MLA Mhathung Yanthan, while addressing the trainees asked the respective district officials not to remain insensitive to the menace as the pest is affecting not only maize but other plants, including the cash crops. Maintaining that FAW has the potential of causing widespread damage, Yanthan asked all to take the responsibility to curb the spread of the pest for the general welfare of the maize farmers in the state. Farmers, facing problems due to the pest attack, can contact the district horticulture offices for support, the Principal Secretary to the Government of Nagaland, M K Mero, said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The chairman of Naharbari village council, Kikon is the first and the only woman to have ever held this kind of an elected post in Nagaland which has over 1,200 villages. As the 2019 general election draws near, women will be a vital part of the campaigning process, but they will be denied any political leadership role in the highly-patriarchal Naga society. Therefore, it is quite significant when a woman shatters the glass ceiling at the grassroots and gets elected as the head of a governing body, and proves her mettle and is re-elected. \"Men have been good to me, I have been functioning as a chairman with their support,\" says Kikon, who became a member of the village council in 2000 and was first elected to the chairman's post in 2005. \"I have proven myself by creating assets of over Rs 3 crore for the village council. Built schools and other buildings from which we are earning rent now,\" she says. There was no such property when she started. Her stellar performance saw her getting back to the chairman's post uncontested twice. Kikon's journey in public life started during the years of insurgency that left Nagaland bloodied and scarred. \"I rescued a lot of youths when there was no ceasefire, and, in the process, gained confidence,\" says Kikon. \"I am a grassroots worker and people are happy with my work.\" Women form about 9.5 lakh of the state's population of almost 20 lakh, according to the 2011 Census. But she is of the rarest breed when it comes to a woman holding an elected office in Nagaland. \"Naga men will harp on gender equality, but scratch the surface and you will see the patriarchal mindset of the people and the biased customary laws,\" says Kikon. It hasn't always been a smooth ride for Kikon. The gritty 60-year-old mother of three has stood up to threats and worked for society. She has been physically assaulted for standing up to land encroachers who wanted to usurp a community pond. But the gritty woman put up a fight and managed to save it. \"We did miss her while growing up as she spent much of her time in social work but we are extremely proud of her,\" says Francis, Kikon's son, a law graduate. \"She is unlike most women we see around us. She is so busy serving the poor,\" he adds. Despite her achievements and popularity, it's not sure if she will be able to further her political career. \"People expect me to fight the general elections but I don't have monetary power. Fighting elections in Nagaland is a very costly affair. And then there's the traditional mindset,\" she says. But Tokheli is ready for urban local body (ULB) elections, with or without the 33% reservation. The issue of reservation for women in ULB is contentious and had Nagaland burning for days in 2017. At least two people were killed, several injured and shops and business establishments gutted by protesters from various Naga groups that were opposed to reserving of seats for women in the ULBs. \"I will contest the polls and fight even if there is no reservation,\" says a confident Kikon.

Barring Assam and Meghalaya, which received two and nine per cent rainfall above normal, rest of the five NE states - Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura - ended up with deficit rainfall in the pre-monsoon season. The pre-monsoon rainfall, counted from March 1 to May 31, is critical for agriculture in the country. Deputy director general of meteorology at the IMD's Regional Meteorological Centre based in Guwahati, Sanjay O'Neill Shaw, said at 66% departure below normal, the rainfall deficit in Mizoram has been most alarming. In Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh, too, the rainfall experienced this pre-monsoon has been alarming at 61% and 32% below normal, he added. Nagaland and Tripura received 27% and 18% deficit rainfall respectively during this pre-monsoon season. \"The long-range forecast says the NE region of the country is set to receive 91% long period average (LPA) rainfall this monsoon. But a model error, indicating 8% excess or deficit rainfall to this figure, has also been incorporated which stated that the amount of rainfall may go below 8% from the 91% mark or show an upsurge upto 8%. If the actual rainfall to be experienced in the monsoon season rises above 91%, it's heartening. But if it declines further, it's worrisome, especially after most of the states in the northeast received deficit rainfall during the pre-monsoon season,\" Shaw told TOI. Monsoon is likely to set over Kerala around June 6, as predicted by the IMD earlier, and advance further before it strikes the northeast. While Assam received 569.3 mm rainfall this pre-monsoon season from March 1 to May 31, Meghalaya received 781.4 mm rainfall during the period to become the second state to receive excess rainfall this year. Rest of the northeastern states received below normal rainfall.

Yet, the saffron party and its allies walked away with 18 of the 25 seats up for grabs in the northeastern states, successfully weathering the storm of unrest that rocked most parts of Assam, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram. The Congress, the grand old part of India, was restricted to just four seats, while its allies bagged two. One constituency was won by an Independent candidate. When protest broke out against the Centre's plan to bring the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB), 2016, dubbed to be against the interest of the indigenous people of the region, many political commentators believed that it would mar the BJP's chances in the general elections in the North East. The bill had proposed to give citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis from Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Violent agitations in Assam, Manipur along with protests in Mizoram, Meghalaya and Tripura against the bill forced the Centre to abort plans to introduce it in Rajya Sabha allowing it to lapse. However, proving the naysayers wrong, the BJP and its allies gained majorly, especially in Assam where a total of 14 seats were up for grabs. BJP on its own won in nine seats in the state. In 2014, the saffron party had won seven seats. On the other hand, the Congress won three seats, the same as in 2014. Its ally All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) won one seat, down from three in 2014 while one constituency went to an Independent candidate. In Arunachal Pradesh, Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju led a clean sweep for the BJP on the two Lok Sabha seats in the state, routing the Congress. While Rijiju retained his Arunachal West seat, his party colleague Tapir Gao trumped Congress candidate Lowangcha Wanglat in the Arunachal East constituency. Assam Finance Minister and BJP leader Himanta Biswa Sarma said the win for the NDA in the region was all because of the \"tremendous development\" of the North East under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. \"He has brought a new era for the people of the North East. Today, every part of the North East is connected with Railways, internet and now, there is also air connectivity in every state (of the region),\" he said. In Manipur, the BJP and the Naga Peoples Front won the Inner Manipur and Outer Manipur seats respectively, both of which were won by the Congress in 2014. The BJP further strengthened its position in the region by wresting the two constituencies -- Tripura East and Tripura West -- in Tripura from the Congress. In 2014, both these seats were won by the CPI(M). NDA ally Sikkim Krantikari Morcha added muscle to the coalition grabbing the lone seat in Sikkim by defeating the Sikkim Democratic Front's candidate. In Mizoram, NDA ally Mizo National Front's nominee C Lalrosanga defeated Independent candidate Lalnghinglova Hmar by 8,140 votes in the only Lok Sabha constituency of the state. Congress had won the seat in the last term. BJP ally Democratic Progressive Party's Tokheho Yepthomi won the lone seat in Nagaland defeating Congress candidate K L Chishi by 16,344 votes in a seesaw contest. In a breather for the Congress, the party won the Shillong seat in Meghalaya although it lost Tura constituency to NDA ally National People's Party. The two parties had also won the respective seats in 2014. Going by the outcome, the BJP can claim that the Lotus (its party symbol) is well and truly blooming in the North East.

But those in Safdarjung Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College, RML Hospital and others will skip work. In Kolkata on Sunday, the agitating doctors said they were ready to meet Mamata Banerjee \"anytime and anywhere\". The government proposed a 3pm meeting at the state secretariat on Monday. The doctors were reportedly ready to accept the proposal.

The state government, however, cited legalities and constitutional propriety, which prevent such meetings from being held under public glare. The doctors were ready to accept the government's request, sources indicated late Sunday, which would pave the way for \"across-the-table\" discussions between the protesters and the chief minister. \"We are very hopeful for the meeting in Nabanna (state secretariat) on Monday,\" a senior official, mediating for the state, said. \"We have explained to them that given the issues involved, mainly legal, administrative and security-related, it is impossible for the state government to agree to their demand for an open-door meeting in presence of the media. The CM is also sworn to an oath of secrecy in some such matters. We have explained they have every right to speak to media afterwards, much like the norm in all such cases. They have agreed to it,\" he said. Under pressure from several quarters, including the seniors in the medical fraternity, the junior doctors in Kolkata held a four-hour general body meeting at NRS Hospital. The meeting appeared to split three ways. While a section of doctors agreed to have the meeting at Nabanna, another section stressed on Raj Bhavan as the venue, while the remaining stuck to their demand for NRS Hospital. Pressure further mounted on the striking doctors to find a solution to the standoff. At 3.30pm, a group of doctors announced their stand. \"We are hopeful that our CM will be considerate enough to solve the problems that the state is facing in the healthcare sector currently,\" they said in a statement while refusing to accept any question from the media. \"We leave the decision to choose the venue to the honourable CM, but it should accommodate representatives of all medical colleges of West Bengal in sufficient numbers,\" the statement read.

Nagaland recorded nine deaths, Sikkim (8), Meghalaya (7) and Arunchal Pradesh (3). In 2016, Assam recorded 200 deaths due to ARI, Mizoram (68), Sikkim (43), Manipur (21), Tripura (7) and Arunchal Pradesh (4). However, Nagaland didn't record any death due to ARI that year.

State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority ( SEIAA) chairman KG Bhattacharyya, who attended a World Environment Day programme organized by the Pollution Control Board, Assam, here on Wednesday, expressed concern over the increasing trend of particulate matter (PM10) (particles of size less than 10 micrometer) in five cities and towns of Assam. The places are Guwahati, Nalbari, Nagaon, Silchar & Sivasagar. Bhattacharyya said particulate matter (PM2.5) pollutants are more dangerous than PM10 level in the air. Former Meghalaya governor RS Mushahary said the government has to do a lot for fulfilling the 'Pollution Free Environment' agenda. He added that citizens have to be involved in achieving this goal. Biodiversity conservation organization Aaranyak said monitoring of air quality by the Assam Pollution Control Board at Bamunimaidan in Guwahati has revealed the presence of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) well above the prescribed limit since 2008. Aaranyak said Guwahati's air is found to have very high content of black carbon. \"There must be a paradigm change in our public transport system and related policy to bring down the rapid growth of vehicles out on the roads by introducing a mass transit system that will also help in climate change mitigation. Introduction of clean fuel and discouraging prevalence of dirty fuels as a policy strategy will go a long way in curbing vehicular air pollution,\" said an Aaranyak official.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

In its last weather bulletin, issued at 2.30am on Sunday, the India Meterological Department said the depression has weakened. Moving over western Meghalaya and adjoining Bangladesh, it moved northeastwards in the past six hours, lost steam and lay as a \u201cwellmarked low pressure area\u201d over central Assam and its neighbourhood at 11.30pm on Saturday night. \u201cThe well-marked low pressure area over central Assam and the neighbourhood, caused by Fani, moved northeastwards and weakened into a low pressure area over north Myanmar and adjoining east Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Manipur at 5.30am on Sunday,\u201d asenior official of the Guwahati-based Regional Meteorological Centre of the IMD told TOI. Soon after Fani fizzled out, weather conditions improved significantly in the region. Gusts of wind and heavy rainfall gave way to sunny conditions on Sunday; only some areas of upper Assam received some rainfall. In its final trail, Fani caused incessant rain, causing floods in northern Kamrup and Goalpara districts that caused flood in several areas, water logging at Dispur, Sonapur and Chandrapur revenue circles of Kamrup (Metropolitan) district and some low-lying areas of Guwahati on Saturday night. In some of the hilly areas under the Dispur revenue circle, landslides occurred over the last 24 hours but no casualty was reported. The intensity of Fani started declining as it turned into a deep depression after it entered Bangladesh on Saturday morning. Further, the weather system converted into a depression when it emerged in Meghalaya later in the day. Over 11 days, Fani intensified from a low pressure area over east Equatorial Indian Ocean, adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal, to an extremely severe cyclonic storm over west-central Bay of Bengal. IMD said a low pressure area had formed over east equatorial Indian Ocean and adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal early morning on April 25 and it became a \u201cwell marked low pressure area\u201d over the same region during in three hours on the same day.  It concentrated into a depression over the same region in the morning of April 26 and intensified further into a deep depression in the early morning of April 27.

Rio was speaking on the occasion of the completion of one year of his People's Democratic Alliance (PDA) government, of which the BJP is a part. A new government, which came to power in Nagaland under Rio early last year, had raised hopes of a solution to the Naga political problem. The Election Commission on Sunday announced that the Lok Sabha election will be held from April 11 to May 19. \"The government and the Naga people now do not know what the negotiating parties are thinking,\" Rio told the media, adding, \"If it (Naga political solution) does not come...it will be a problem for our Naga society to carry on.\" Even after the signing of the framework agreement with the NSCN(IM) in 2015 and six Naga nationalist political groups joining the peace talks separately, there has not been a breakthrough on the decades-old Naga problem. The PDA, comprising 17 Nationalist Democratic Progress Party (NDPP) MLAs, 12 BJP, 2 NPP and one JD(U) and an Independent, came to power after defeating the 15-year-old Naga People's Front government in the 2018 assembly election. Thanking the allies, Rio said, \"We could not have made it, unless we received firm support from our alliance partners.\" \"We promised to bring change (before the assembly poll), but the change has to start from the attitude and mindset of the people towards positivity,\" he said.  He said a move towards plastic-free state and initiatives of tobacco-free villages and green villages are positive changes and such initiatives will bring positivity. \"Real change will happen when we all come together in unison with the singular purpose of changing our society for the better,\" the chief minister said.

Sonnie Kath is considered to be the pioneer who breathed new life into loin loom weaving in Nagaland. Back in 2003, Sonnie, along with her two sisters, founded 'Echo Self Help Group' and reintroduced traditional weaving in Diezephe village, 15km from Dimapur, the commercial capital of Nagaland. \"What started as an experiment involving 11 weavers has now turned into an industry of 200 women,\" says Haiyale, one of the co-founders. \"Depending upon the design and how much they weave, some women earn up to Rs 6,000 a month,\" she says. The NGO of the Kath sisters has now evolved into 'Exotic Echo' with Haiyale as president. Exotic Echo not only produces and markets its products, it grows cotton, spins it into yarn, and dyes it too! Exotic Echo has been hosting the annual 'Loinloom Festival' in the first week of December, for the last 5 years, and has brought in weaving-centred tourism to the state. \"We have 11 bamboo and mud huts for homestay and additional camping infrastructure for 40 campers. Discerning travellers can now stay in Diezephe, enjoy the crafts village and the weaving process,\" says Haiyale, adding that it is helping generate additional employment. A recent initiative, Weaver's Place is attracting tourists even from abroad, she adds. Mekhala Mama One woman has taken the campaign for traditional weaves online. Theyiesinuo Keditsu, aka Mekhala Mama, is an Insta celeb with close to 10,000 followers. An assistant professor of literature at Kohima College, Keditsu posts photos on Instagram flaunting the traditional Naga sarong, which has inspired not just youths from Nagaland, but many more outside, to try the wraparound worn as a skirt in the northeast. She has a mekhala for every occasion and mood. But Keditsu's Insta page isn't about fulfilling a narcissistic desire. The mom from Nagaland is on a mission - to popularise Naga indigenous textiles and support women weavers and local businesses. And she's going about it with elan. Keditsu was jolted out of her reverie while on a window-shopping trip to a mekhala store in Kohima two years ago. \"The shopkeeper lamented that fewer young women come to buy mekhalas and that mekhalas don't sell as much as they used to. She told me many weavers aren't motivated to continue weaving and are opting to do other work. This was scary and set me thinking about doing something beyond increasing my personal collection,\" Keditsu tells TOI. Traditional weaving in most of the northeast has fallen victim to power looms. She started the Instagram page and began demonstrating that the mekhala is a \"viable fashion item\" for everyday wear. There has been a sea change ever since. \"My account has generated a lot of interest among young Naga women. Many of them regularly send me photos and have made commitments to incorporate mekhalas into their daily and occasion wear,\" Keditsu says, adding that she gets a huge number of queries from outside of Nagaland and the northeast. Warp and Weft Akhwele, 48, and her friend Avole, 38, live in Chizami village which is 88km from state capital Kohima. While Instagram and Mekhala Mama are unknown here, the lives of all three are connected by the threads of the loom. In the village, Akhwele is weaving on a loin loom and chatting nonchalantly with her friend Avole. The paddy that is spread out beside them glistens in the light of the early morning sun, now risen above the green Naga hills. Avole shoos away a couple of chicken, which are stealing a quick peck at the grain, while warping thread around sticks. She's planning to weave a stole - a miniature version of the traditional shawl that has become a style statement of Naga men these days. Chizami and 13 other villages around it are weaving a slow change. Traditional loin loom weaving, which was dying in the state, was revived in Chizami - a village of 600 households - by North East Network (NEN), an organization that champions women's rights and works to empower them through skill development and livelihood training. Women of Chizami and the other villages in Phek district are now associated with NEN. The supplementary income from weaving and the boost to self-esteem through it has changed the position of the women within the family, even yielding them political space in village councils. Other than the traditional mekhala and shawl, the women are now weaving items of home furnishing like table mats and runners, bags and pouches, which are sold by NEN under the brand name 'Chizami Weaves'. \"Women weaving for 15 days, for three to four hours a day, earn up to Rs2,000 a month. This hard cash is getting them newfound respect from their husbands and in-laws. The attitude of men has changed so much so that in some cases they are even babysitting and helping in household chores, unimaginable earlier in a highly patriarchal society,\" says Wekoweu Tsuhah, the programme director of NEN in Nagaland. The money may sound loose change to some, but in rural hinterlands here, it is a game-changer. Slowly, the weavers are becoming assertive and playing an active part in village council meetings. \"In what is quite an example, two weaver women made it to the village council of Enhulumi,\" Tsuhah says. Thread Counts In an agrarian society, weaving was mostly done between the primary field work and household chores, but now it is helping supplement income and giving women more say. \"I am paying the fees of my third son in a Kohima college, from my earnings from the loom,\" a proud Akhwele of Chizami village says. Now, not only do her husband and sons help her in cooking, even neighbours come to her for advice owing to the popularity and recognition she has gained as a master weaver. The fame of Chizami has spread far and wide. Akhwele and Avole are among the few master weavers who recently trained a batch of 30 students from New Delhi's Indian Institute of Art and Design. Nearly 600 women weavers are associated with NEN and are also helping in keeping alive traditional weaving, whose designs and motifs have been passed on from one generation to the next for hundreds of years. It is also taking the weavers places. \"I attended a national handloom convention in Hyderabad in November last year where I learnt Thai weaving techniques and shared my knowledge too,\" says Akhwele, who has travelled beyond Nagaland only twice in her life.  Feminist Designs Like in Homer's Iliad, where Helen weaves a great web with scenes from the battle between the Trojans and the Greek, Naga women, too, have over the ages embroidered the tapestry with their angst, and the occasional respites. History in themselves, the designs will now be kept alive by the few sentinels of time in the age of powerlooms. \"Many times the designs aren't planned. The freedom to express myself in the loom gives rise to many abstract designs and patterns,\" Akhwele says. Mekhala Mama Keditsu, too, sees tapestry as a canvas to preserve the highly undocumented oral folklore of the Nagas. \"Weaving is an exclusively female art among the Nagas, so our cloths are intimately tied with women's narratives - both of past and present,\" Keditsu says. She is very hopeful for the traditional Naga weaves because of the \"resurgence in indigenous pride over the last two decades\". \"Fashion, as we all know, plays a huge role in the articulation and enactment of identities, so it is important to have accounts like mine as archives for those looking for information and material on our textiles,\" Keditsu says. If you have the will, tradition can make a fashion statement any day. Ask the Naga ladies!

Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The arrival of the monsoon in the region is likely to cause heavy rain in isolated places in Assam and Meghalaya from Wednesday onwards, the forecast said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

At least 25 of its leaders have quit after being denied tickets while all its allies, barring two in Assam, the Asom Gana Parishad and the Bodoland Peoples' Front and the NDPP in Nagaland, are fighting alone. The biggest jolt came from Arunachal Pradesh-which is going for simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls on April 11-after 18 of its leaders, including two ministers and six MLAs, switched sides as candidates of the National People's Party (NPP) led by Conrad Sangma for the state election. On Tuesday, tremors were felt in Tripura when BJP vice-president Subal Bhowmik and its SC Morcha leader Prakash Chandra Das joined the Congress along with hundreds of followers. On the other hand in Assam, the party's sitting MP from Tezpur and Gorkha leader Ram Prasad Sarmah quit after his name was recommended by the state unit for re-nomination as a candidate for the seat. Sarmah is considered the most influential Gorkha leader in the region because of which the BJP national leadership requested him not to join any other party and promised him compensation. Not just its own men, the saffron party is also seeing its allies moving out as swiftly as they had come in less than three years since 2016 to NEDA, the northeast version of NDA. The signs were palpable in Guwahati in January when a convention chaired by NPP president Conrad Sangma of NEDA partners resolved to oppose the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. After bringing back the AGP into its fold a few days back, NEDA convenor Himanta Biswa Sarma said that BJP's alliance with the AGP and BPF has been sealed but '100 per cent' was not possible with the NPP. The NPP, besides fielding its own candidate in Meghalaya, is also contesting alone in Manipur. The United Democratic Party in Meghalaya has also severed its links with BJP and is putting up its own candidate. The saffron party also failed to strike a seat-sharing deal with its ally in Tripura, the IPFT, and subsequently the regional party for tribal separate state has fielded its candidates for the two Lok Sabha seats, who will be contesting against BJP's two. Similarly, the Mizo National Front has not waited for the BJP to declare its candidate for the lone seat in the state. The regional party on Wednesday took a step forward by adopting a resolution in the assembly to oppose the citizenship bill. Arunachal BJP president Tapir Gao said, \"There is no alliance now with these regional parties but we are still friends. They are not our rivals like the Congress. They need to contest elections on their own for their political survival. After the elections they will all be back with us.\" Gao said BJP leaders of Arunachal Pradesh joining the NPP will not make any dent. \"The basis of selection of candidates was their winning probability. Those who had low winning probability were not given tickets. They will not win even if they go to the NPP or any other party because they have lost their winning capacity,\" he added.

Asked about Congress' Delhi unit president Sheila Dikshit's remarks that Kejriwal never approached her for an alliance, the chief minister said, \u201cWe have met Rahul Gandhi. Dikshit is not that important leader.\u201d Kejriwal has been urging the Congress to stitch an alliance in Delhi for the Lok Sabha polls to keep the BJP away from power. Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.
