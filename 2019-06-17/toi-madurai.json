{"Girls as camp coolies a bigger discrimination than foeticide, says survey": {"datetime": "", "description": "MADURAI: Foeticide and infanticide are no more the worst forms of discrimination towards a girl child, according to an opinion survey conducted among women as well as men of 20 southern villages in the state. The rural lot, who took part in the sample survey on the challenges faced by girls and women, rated them as the least important of the issues in a list of 12. For them, the issue of top concern is the poor financial conditions forcing adolescent girls to work as camp coolies in spinning mills. This is followed by child marriage or early marriage. Women\u2019s opinion getting ignored at home as well as in the community in decision making was rated as the third most important issue. The survey was conducted by five NGOs \u2013 Navajeevan Trust (NJT) Tirunelveli, NEEDS in Virudhunagar, People\u2019s Action for Development (PAD) Ramanathapuram, Manushi in Pudukkottai \u2013 coordinated by Centre for Social Education and Development (CSED), Tirupur. Denial or lack of importance for higher education and lack of recognition for work done by women are among the more serious issues pointed out by the 3,368 people who took part in the survey in four southern districts. This is followed by physical, emotional, sexual and other forms of violence. While dowry-related issues such as postponement of marriages and broken marriages was voted 7th, disparity in wages, lack of recognition and exploitation of their labour were voted as the 6th issue of concern. Less attention to health care needs and suffering from anaemia and malnourishment is 8th. The NGOs conducted the opinion poll in Tirunelveli (774 people), Virudhunagar (980), Ramanathapuram (759) and Pudukottai (855) from May 10 to June 3. Listing out the various forms of discrimination and oppression faced by women and girls in a ballot paper, the villagers were asked to choose them based on a priority based on the seriousness in the order best known to them. To help them make their choice better, posters with pictorial representation of the 12 issues were displayed where the survey was conducted in those villages. They were asked to choose the top five serious issues from a list of 12. The folded sheets had to be deposited in a ballot box. Respondents were in the aged group of above 12 years and were divided into five age categories. As many as 2,196 (65.21%) people who took part in the opinion poll were girls and women, while the remaining 1,172 were men (34.79%). Most of the participants were in the age group of 25-40 years, followed by adults (24.64%) who were between 41 and 60 years of age. CSED executive director C Nambi said that the survey was aimed at bringing to light the partiality and violence faced by girls, adolescent women and women at home, education institutions, work place and in the society.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case.

About 29% of these caregivers \u2014 sons, daughters-in-law, daughters, sons-in-law \u2014 felt that they were burdened, while 15 % of them claimed that it was a severe burden, says a report by Helpage India published on World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. The report, \u201cRole of family in caregiving - challenges and responses 2019\u2019\u2019 was released here on Friday by the district collector in charge S Santhakumar. The study was conducted among a sample population in 20 cities across India, including Chennai. It said that 85% of the caregivers felt that the high fees collected by institutions that took care of the elderly made it difficult for them to avail of the facility. Fatigue and frustration were what 25.7% of the caregivers felt. Surprisingly, the study found that 41% of grandsons took care of their grandparents by participating in various activities, as against just 38% of granddaughters. As medical bills of elderly made a big dent in their monthly budget, the caregivers who took part in the study urged the government to take steps to subsidize rates of medicine and make them GST-free. They also sought government-supported oldage homes, health cards for elderly, free medicine and transport facilities for visiting hospitals. Geriatrician from Madurai, Dr N Raja, points out that caregivers play an important role in the welfare of elders. \u201cThey should be counselled regularly on the requirements of the elderly, else it will result in the elders being abused,\u2019\u2019 he said. There were two types of elder abuse, active and passive. Active abuse included physical and verbal abuse, while passive abuse was ignoring elders. Both types of abuses resulted in elders being affected and getting depressed. Including an elderly person in daily conversations and seeking their help in small chores like folding clothes could help to keep them happy. \u201cMany of them are used to having been the heads of the household and suddenly, when all responsibility and importance are taken away from them it affects them,\u201d he said.

The assurance came in a detailed press statement on Thursday amid rumours of possible devastation that the facility could cause. A public hearing to establish the storage facility is to be held on July 10.It stated that KKNPP in Tirunelveli\u2019s Radhapuram taluk was the seventh nuclear power generating site of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited in India, with a total capacity of 2000 megawatt. All the operating nuclear power stations in India and abroad had facilities to store new as well as spent (used) fuel. The scheme to store spent fuel in a nuclear power plant was two-fold. The first place of storing was within the reactor building and is known as spent fuel storage pool/bay with limited capacity. It was used for immediate storage of the spent fuel removed from the reactor during refuelling. It remained in the pool initially for a few years to cool it sufficiently before being shifted to the AFR later. But for a bigger capacity it was functionally similar to the spent fuel pool inside the reactor building.AFR Spent Fuel Storage facility was located within the plant premises and could be constructed as needed. Two AFRs \u2014 at Tarapur near Mumbai and Rawatbhata in Rajasthan \u2014 were in operation in India and one more was being constructed at Rawatbhata. AFR design was specific to fuel type. The proposed facility was designed for storing spent fuel discharged from reactors at Kudankulam 1 and 2 and not from any other reactor. The facility here was not to store nuclear waste as perceived by some, the statement said. It added that requirements for spent fuel storage and waste management were different. The AFR was designed with the highest safety standards in accordance with the highest quality standards, codes and guides of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) and was also designed to withstand extreme natural events. The design ensured that there would not be any adverse impact of the facility on personnel, public and the environment, the statement said. Radiation dose on account of AFR to the public would be negligible as has been established at the two existing AFRs sites in operation.

The NCSC team visited S Valayapatti village along with officials from revenue and police department including district collector (in-charge) S Shantha Kumar on Saturday. When asked whether the transfer of two anganwadi workers belonging to scheduled caste based on pressure from intermediate caste members did not amount to encouraging discrimination, the vice-chairman said that was why he had issued showcause notice to the officials concerned. He had asked them to explain why legal action should not be initiated under the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe (prevention of atrocities) act against those responsible for shunting the anganwadi workers out of the village, he said. Murugan visited the affected people and took stock of the property damaged in the attack that took place on Sunday night. He insisted that the officials carry out speedy investigation and disburse compensation. Four people from scheduled castes had sustained injuries in the attack, which was the culmination point of the caste tension that has been prevailing there for about two years. The issue started flaring up once again in March when the people from scheduled caste were not allowed to worship in the village temple. While the intermediate caste people did not get approval for conducting jallikattu due to the tension, they turned the heat on the scheduled caste people. When they stopped water supply to SC people, the latter approached the local police. The police complaint fuelled the issue leading to the attack. Murugan said \u201cI had sent a detailed circular to all district superintendents of police in the wake of Katchanathan attack case to identity vulnerable areas and provide counselling to people to pre-empt communal issues and asked them to take stringent action against those behind such attacks.\u201d With the students belonging to intermediate caste not turning up at the school after the incident, the vice-chairman asked the officials to bring all the students back to the classroom from Monday onwards. He said that 11 accused in connection with the attack have been arrested so far, but the villagers wanted 28 more to be arrested. He said the police will form more teams and arrest all the suspects. The temple will be opened and officials will ensure that both communities worship without any dispute. The first installment of payment under SC/ST act to the victims will be disbursed on Monday, he said.

They urged the authorities concerned to heighten safety measures by installing fence at vulnerable points. \u201cIf the safety measures are not improved, deaths are bound to take place at the bridge. Measures should be taken to control speeding vehicle,\u201d said J Vetriselvam, an autorickshaw driver from Jaihindpuram. V Kalamegan, a social activist from Palanganatham, said the idea behind road over bridge was originally to connect Madukulam road on one side and two arms on the other side connecting TVS Nagar and Jaihindpuram road. But the arm to connect Jaihindpuram never was constructed. \u201cAt present, the entire bridge is useless due to its poor designing. It is used only residents for morning walk and children for cycling. Anti-social activities take place at nights due to poor lighting,\u201d he said. The bridge would serve the purpose only if the arm was also constructed, he added. A traffic police officer said that the bridge continues to be snubbed by motorists despite efforts to sensitise them against it.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

The admission process for postgraduate courses was carried out in three phases this year: while in the first phase it was for courses which didn\u2019t require any entrance examination, the second was for courses for which admission was done based on the state-level entrance test and the third was for those for which national-level entrance was held. According to Vaiko, when it came to the entrance examinations, the results were never declared and even for the admission procedure, the ranking or merit list was not disclosed in proper manner. Further, he claimed that for counselling, which was held on May 13, the communication for the candidates was sent only by May 10 that too via post and as one of the two days in between was a holiday (Sunday), the information didn\u2019t reach the candidates on time. \u201cThe communication didn\u2019t even reach many and hence only a few students participated in the counselling on Monday,\u201d he added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

But it has not been easy for her to run the shop as those from intermediate caste who owned shops were creating trouble. \u201cThe distributor of a popular packaged milk sachet is not supplying me milk due to pressure from the owners of the other two shops.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Speaking to reporters after symbolically initiating the works with a pickaxe, he said that the foundation stone for the site museum would be laid soon. Keezhadi excavation was being conducted by the Tamil Nadu archaeological department. While the first three phases were conducted by Archaeological Survey of India, the fourth and now the fifth phases were being conducted by the state department. A total of 13,638 artefacts had been unearthed during the first four phases. The first three phases of excavations that took place between 2014 and 2017 had found 7,818 articles used by the people of the ancient era, while the fourth phase between 2017 and 2018 had unearthed 5,820 things. Site museums were to be established in Keezhadi, Korkai, Alagankulam and Athichanallur, he said. The state had 36 museums and six more were to be established this year. Next year, museums would be established in Tirupur and Namakkal. He said that the artefacts unearthed at Keezhadi would be sent to the US for carbon dating and the age of the ancient articles would be determined through fluorescence dating, a facility available in India. The fifth phase would be short and take about four to five months where fifteen trenches would be dug. This was the first time that underground structures had been identified using geomagnetism, which was more accurate and could define the structures sharply, he said. The expertise of Indian Institute of Geomagnetism is being used for this purpose, he added. The excavation in the fifth phase was to be carried out at a cost of Rs 47 lakh with deputy director of archaeology, Dr R Sivanantham, who led the fourth phase, conducting the fifth phase as well, he said. Pandiarajan said that they had found evidence from the four excavations that Keezhadi was as important as Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. It was believed that Keezhadi was a site, where a riverside civilization and urban civilization merged. The minister said that the 35 trenches that had been dug before had been covered with sand after marking them. However, in future they may open them and make it a visiting tourist spot, like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa after acquiring the land, but it was not an immediate plan. The minister said that they had received the reports of the Athichanallur excavation after a delay of 17 years and that it would be released by chief minister Edapaddi K Palaniswami soon along with the proposed perception plan for archaeology in the state. He added that they were yet to receive the reports of the first two phases of Keezhadi excavation from the ASI. The current period was the golden era for state archaeology with many excavation and restoration works being undertaken simultaneously. Twelve fortresses including the Thirumalai Naicker Mahal in Madurai were to be renovated at a cost of Rs 24 crore, he added.

This was revealed at a press meet organized to announce the textile expo to be held from June 18 to 21 at Madurai District Tiny and Small-Scale Industries Association (Maditssia). Project director of the textile processing park K R Gnanasambandan said that they were in the process of seeking permission for the foundation stone laying ceremony of the park which is to be spread over 100 acres. He said the park would be established in a year. As in other districts, textiles had been flourishing in Madurai and the southern districts too with about 75 units functioning well till recently in Madurai alone. However, about 35 of them had closed down thanks to the issue of pollution.  The remaining ones were suspended because power supply was stopped over the issue. Gnanasambandan said that the textile processing park project was signed by late chief minister J Jayalalithaa at the 2015 Global Investors Meet and Maditssia was the first to take up the offer. ``The central government will contribute Rs 100 crore and the state government and Maditssia Rs 50 crore each for this park,\u2019\u2019 he said. It had taken them five years to get clearances at different levels, including the most important one on pollution from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, and other environmental clearances. The park would house 40 textile units which would be relocated into the park from in and around Madurai. The units would bleach and dye textiles, but there would be zero discharge. He said that 96% of the water from the park would be recycled while the remaining 4 %, which was sludge, would be sent to the evaporator. The water in the sludge would evaporate and the remaining solid, which was predominantly lime, would be sent to the cement industry. He said that the park could help rejuvenate the textile industry throughout the state as it would help them with the crucial functions of bleaching and dyeing. All types of yarn could be processed here. Once functional, the park would provide direct employment to 2,000 people and indirect employment to over 5,000 people, he added.

In a pre-budget memorandum to the minister, the chamber\u2019s senior president S Rethinavelu and president N Jegatheesan stated that doing away with the 28 per cent tax slab and reducing the tax rates in the other categories would result in better compliance and reflect with increase in tax paid to the government. Lauding the government for reducing GST on various goods from 28% to 18 % at the 28th meeting of the GST Council on July 21, 2018, they pointed out that as many as 28 items including cement and automobile parts are still under the 28 per cent slab. They said that goods that have to be placed under the 12% slab are in the 18% category and this applies to the 12% and 5 % categories as well. The chamber pressed for 18 per cent as highest GST and that it should be applicable only to sin and luxury goods. Suggesting a new Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR) at 15%, they said that the tax slab of existing goods should be reduced to 15%, 12%, 5 % and zero per cent, respectively, from the existing slabs. According to the chamber, all homogenous products should have the same rate to avoid any confusion in the tax rate. \u201cWhat is wrong in fixing the same tax rate on fabric stitched or unstitched? Similarly, there are several items to be simplified. We sincerely hope the FM would rationalize the classification of products under different slab rates,\u201d Rethinavelu said. They sought inclusion of representatives of leading chambers of commerce from all States in the GST Council for enlisting their views and suggestions. They pointed out that businessmen and manufactures are among the main stakeholders in the GST system. They claimed that they are not given an opportunity to directly put forth their suggestions to the GST Council. The chamber stated that dealers are forced to spend much more on GST compliance compared to general sales tax and value added tax. \u201cThe existing system is so complicated that the MSME sector has to spend a monthly consulting fee of Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000 and up to Rs 30,000 annually for the annual return and certification.

In representations to SR general manager and top officials in the Madurai and Thiruvananthapuram railway divisions and MLAs, the association requested for diversion of the trains through Madurai, Dindigul, Karur, Namakkal and Salem, without touching Tiruchirappalli route. KKDRUA secretary P Edward Jeni said this was the only weekly train connecting Jolarpettai, Katpadi, Arakkonam and Tiruvallur to the southern districts of Tamil Nadu. \u201cA large number of students from southern districts are studying in VIT and institutions in the northern region.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The incident took place in a village near Periyakulam on Friday night. Baskaran suffered an injury below his eye when a stone hit him. He was initially treated at the Theni Medical College Hospital, before being shifted to a private hospital in Madurai. He was later shifted to a private eye hospital. A doctor treating him said that it was a minor injury and there was no threat to his eyesight. \u201cWe have advised hospitalization for one more day just to ensure that he takes rest. We are treating him to reduce pain and swollen muscles,\u201d said the doctor. Higher police officers including ADGP Jayanth Murali, Madurai city police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham and south zone IG K P Shanmuga Rajeswaran visited the injured SP in hospital. Meanwhile, the Thenkarai police have registered a case against a few people from Saruthupatti village, who took part in the protest. \u201cAn FIR has been registered. We have arrested five people so far and searching for a few more,\u201d said inspector Mathana Kala. Around 400 police personnel have been deployed in the village and the suspects are being combed. Police said that it all began when a police constable identified as Siranjeevi attached to Devadhanapatti police station, and hailing from Saruthupatti village, claimed that he was attacked by some members of an intermediate caste from Lakshmipuram at Pomminayakkanpatti. This created tension and as a result the villagers staged a blockade on the Theni-Periyakulam road seeking the arrest of the \u2018suspects\u2019. \u201cThe police constable made a false claim to give a communal twist. Inquiry is underway to find out the reason. While there has been mounting tension between the two castes in the last three days, the villagers began a protest,\u201d a police officer said. As traffic was affected on the road, SP Baskaran along with others arrived at the spot. After a while, when things went out of control and the protesters started pelting stones resulting in injuries to the police personnel. Police had to resort to a lathicharge after the stone pelting incident to disburse the crowd. Adequate strength has been deployed in all vulnerable areas and things are under control. There will not be any further escalation of tension, said deputy superintendent police, Periyakulam range, V Arumugam. Police sources said the tension between two castes in Periakulam region started on June 12, when a couple of youngsters from scheduled caste were questioned by members of the intermediate caste from Lakshmipuram for speeding through the street. While the duo left, they came back later and attacked those who questioned them. This led to people from Lakshmipuram stage a road blockade on June 13. They reportedly attacked a couple of students belonging to the scheduled caste from another village, when they were passing through the protest.

Adviser of Aishwarayam Trust, a hospice and palliative care centre, Manikandan arrives at the spot whenever his help is needed for a social cause like taking care of the injured, finding a home for abandoned people or at an accident spot. But the one job he does promptly is visit the dozens of free oldage homes in the city, where elderly persons yearn for the visit of a loved one. ``Many of them look up to me like a relative and it becomes our responsibility to take care of their last rites.

A simple funeral costs about Rs 5,000, including ambulance expenditure, cremation ground services and rituals. ``It is disheartening not just because the deceased was a known person, but due to the attitude of their relatives. They do not come forward to receive the body for fear of having to bear the expenses. I do it with the help of friends and kind-hearted people who contribute to the cause,\u2019\u2019 he said. What is really depressing is when the people in these homes ask him if he would perform the last rites for them too, like he did for another inmate. ``When I go to the home a day after the funeral this is a common question I face.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Chances are that your leg will get caught in a deep gaping hole on the one-kilometre stretch. The stretch of the 80 feet road on Anna Nagar main road, from Ambiga theatre to Golcha complex, has a pavement bordering the road continuously except at places where the streets intercept. The elevated pavement has been laid over a drainage. Morning walkers are seen walking along this stretch, but they prefer to walk on the road as the pavement is not safe. ``Most of the holes in the pavement are visible only during daytime, and anyone falling in could have a serious accident, as there is no foothold below the pavement,\u2019\u2019 said K Thiagarajan of Anna Nagar. This long running pavement is at the entrance of many shops that have started dotting the area, many of them large shops, banks, bank ATMs, eateries, fruits stalls, grocery shops and medical shops. Most of these shops have used boards to close the holes in front of their shops, which makes them more dangerous. ``We did make some representations about two years ago, but nothing was done,\u2019\u2019 said Kumar, a shopkeeper. In places like the bus stop at Suguna store, the holes are big and can result in a person falling into it if the stone kept temporarily gets damaged or breaks, say these shopkeepers.

Petitioner T Pitchaiah was holding the post of PIO under Right to Information (RTI) Act in the Tiruvarur collectorate and had furnished certain information to an information seeker. Not satisfied with it, the information seeker approached the information commission to punish the petitioner. The directions issued by the commission were also not adhered to and in this regard, the counsel who appeared for the petitioner pointed out that a notice was received by the petitioner on December 8, 2008 asking him to appear on December 3, 2008 ! The counsel submitted that the successor of the petitioner who was holding the post of PIO failed to appear before the commission to produce the records. Thus, the petitioner cannot be blamed for the omission committed by his successor. The counsel further submitted that no notice or opportunity was given to the petitioner to be heard before being slapped the penalty and hence the penalty order issued in 2010 must be quashed.

Hence, the order of imposing penalty is not only improper but in violation to clause of Section 20 of RTI Act. The counsel who appeared for the petitioner brought to the notice of the court that the petitioner had already retired from service and now was a pensioner and therefore remanding the matter would not serve any purpose. The court noted that the additional government pleader was unable to establish that such a notice had already been provided to the petitioner before issuing the order of penalty. The court observed that this being the legal principle to be followed and the fact that the petitioner had already attained the age of superannuation and allowed to retire, no purpose would be served in remanding the matter now after a lapse of many years.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood.

He hunted the schedule I species (under The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972) that are available in a sizeable number at Paluvur near Ilayangudi. The forest department personnel were engaged in vehicle checking near Kalayarkoil when they waved down a two-wheeler on which the rider had an unusually big bag.

The petitioner, K Rajan, moved the HC praying to quash the order of the assistant director of sericulture department, Trichy, to recover the financial loss during the course of the auction of silk materials from the petitioner. Rajan was employed as the junior inspector and was alleged of misappropriation of silk materials and was placed under suspension. A criminal case was registered against him during the year 1996 and the same was closed as barred by the law of limitation under section 468(2) CrPC during the year 2003. A revision petition filed by the police officials before the sessions judge at Trichy which was also dismissed during the year 2008. Due to which there is no criminal case pending against the petitioner. Departmental disciplinary proceedings was also initiated by an assistant director of sericulture against the petitioner. An enquiry was conducted and punishment of stoppage of increment for one year with cumulative effect was imposed on the petitioner and the alleged loss amount was also recovered from the petitioner. After a delay of 14 years from the date of the incident, an order dated 22nd March 2010 was passed stating that during the course of auction of the silk materials, the department sustained a financial loss and therefore the petitioner is liable to pay the loss amount occurred. Justice S M Subramaniam observed that the court is of the considered opinion that the departmental proceedings were already initiated against the petitioner and financial loss during the relevant point of time was assessed and the same was also recovered. The court further observed that now after a lapse of many years while auctioning the silk materials, the authorities cannot assess the financial loss as against the petitioner and recover the same. \u201cUnder these circumstances, any further recovery subsequently imposed in respect of the same silk materials cannot be sustained and the assistant director of sericulture, Trichy, is bound to initiate appropriate action against the officials who are all responsible for not assessing the financial loss against the petitioner during the relevant point of time and not auctioning the silk materials during relevant point of time to minimize the loss,\u201d observed the judge. The judge noted that thus those officials who caused loss, undoubtedly must be held responsible for such loss and suitable action should be initiated by the head of the department in this regard.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The Madurai district police had created the park inside the district police office in Surveyor Colony and are now planning to inaugurate a canteen on Friday. Around 110 trees belong to 24 varieties mentioned in one of the poems in the epic\u2019s Madurai Kandam section.

The park was the brain child of Madurai district superintendent of police N Manivannan, who closed down a defunct tank in front of the rural police office using 1,000 truckloads of soil and created the park in that space. The SP said that the canteen, for which they started construction soon after planting the trees last year, has also been completed. It will be thrown open on Friday. Snacks and food will be available at subsidized price. People, who come to petition him, can refresh themselves at the canteen and see the historical tree varieties, he said.

A plaque mentioning the name of each tree, its significance and the poem, where the species were featured in the epic will be erected. \u201cAround 10% of the saplings did not survive, while others have grown well. Soon new saplings will be planted to compensate the withered ones,\u201d Manivannan said.

On finding a place to stay in the outskirts of the city, Kovalan alone entered the city to sell one of Kannagi\u2019s anklets and start a business.
