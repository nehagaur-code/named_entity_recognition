The plant will produce 45,000 liters of ethanol per day, and the project is set up with an investment of Rs.60 crore. Addressing a gathering, Patel said: \u201cEarlier, molasses was produced from sugar cane, but it was not giving enough earnings to the sugar factories, and thus farmers could not be benefited. With the production of ethanol, there is an assured market, as the UPA government has made it mandatory to use at least 10% of biofuel into diesel and petrol.\u201d \u201cThe oil companies are the assured buyers of ethanol and other biofuels. Around eight sugar producing cooperatives are producing ethanol from molasses, whereas Narmada sugar has taken a lead to produce it directly from sugar cane which will reduce one step and increase productivity.

There are over 3,000 chartered accountants registered with ICAI and only 800 are the practising CAs.\u201d The ACB had arrested an assistant charity commissioner Ramesh Patel and his aide Manish Pachhigar red-handed while accepting bribe of Rs 75,000 for approving changes in the name of working committee members and trustees of a registered trust on Tuesday. ACB had identified Pachhigar as The CA through whom Patel had demanded bribe to approve changes in the name of trustees. ACB, meanwhile, produced Patel and Pachhigar in a local court, which remanded duo to ACB custody till June 14 for further questioning. The CAs affiliated with ICAI have asked the public, trade and industry, not to utilize services of persons impersonating as CA and are not members of the ICAI. According to Thakkar, the Surat branch of ICAI has demanded to increase penalty on non-members representing in any cases in the income tax department or any other central and state agencies from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5 lakh for first offence and Rs 5,000 to Rs 20 lakh for second offence along with imprisonment of one year. \u201cWe have also suggested to take strong action against non-members representing themselves as CAs and sought the amendment of Section 24 of the Chartered Accountant Act, 1949, by imposing exemplary penalty for falsely claiming to be a member and using the CA logo\u201d said Thakkar. PACHHIGAR ACTED AS TOUT FOR 300 TRUSTS Surat: Pachhigar, who impersonated himself as a CA, had developed a client\u00e8le of 300 trusts and dealt on their behalf with the charity commissioner office, said ACB sources. \u201cThe accused did not complete study and is a tout who dealt in with officials of charity commissioner officer.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

However, the officers who actually allowed construction of the illegal fourth floor, sometime between 2015 and 2017 as per the police investigation, are still scot-free. An entire floor was constructed inside the dome, which SMC officers reportedly chose to turn a blind eye to. After the owners paid the impact fees, civic body has been collecting annual property tax, which is calculated by measuring and checking the building\u2019s constructed area. Located on the the main Varachha Road and exactly at Sarthana Crossroads, it\u2019s a mystery how the Arcade\u2019s killer fourth floor escaped SMC officials\u2019 notice. The SMC officers, who have been arrested, have played a role at various levels when the impact fee proposal of the building was approved. The accused owners had owned some portion of a ground plus one storey building named as Bholenath Complex initially. They later added two storeys and a dome on the terrace which was regularized under impact fees in 2013, police informed. The dome, which was more than 15 foot high from the centre, acted as a shield for the unauthorized floor. The rear of the oval-shaped dome was covered with iron sheets, while the front had sliding windows. Inside the dome, the unauthorized floor was not as wide as the lower floors with the boundary around two and half feet inside compared to the rest of the building. The floor is believed to have been designed and developed in a manner that it is not very heavy. The owners had built highly inflammable wooden steps, wooden floors and light-weight furniture besides tyres for children to sit. \u201cThe investigation is on and we are probing the role of various persons.

They have also warned citizens that non-compliance with rules puts the onus on builders, contractors and them if anything untoward happens.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The production cut over since January is estimated to be worth Rs 30,000 crore. Most of the diamond units, especially the small units operating less than 20 emery wheels have cut production by shutting down 80% of their machines. Surat Diamond Association (SDA), president Babu Gujarati said, \u201cDemand of polished diamonds in the global market is very poor due to trade war between China and US. Further, the rough diamond prices are at all time high, which has reduced the profit margin of the polishers.\u201d \u201cThose operating 15 emery wheels have shut half of the wheels. However, the workers have not been affected as there is no information on them losing job. However, their wages have suffered a cut due to the ongoing crisis.\u201d Diamond industry analyst, Aniruddha Lidbide told TOI, \u201cThe crisis in the diamond industry is going to become worse in the coming months. The biggest challenge facing the industry is the popularity of lab-grown diamonds in the key markets like US.\u201d Jaysukh Gajera, president of Surat Ratnakalakar Sangh, an association of diamond polishers told TOI, \u201cThe issue of wages is going to be a big issue in the coming days as the diamond manufacturers have drastically reduced work. We have started getting complaints of the workers being paid less.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

The meeting appeared to split three ways. While a section of doctors agreed to have the meeting at Nabanna, another section stressed on Raj Bhavan as the venue, while the remaining stuck to their demand for NRS Hospital. Pressure further mounted on the striking doctors to find a solution to the standoff. At 3.30pm, a group of doctors announced their stand. \"We are hopeful that our CM will be considerate enough to solve the problems that the state is facing in the healthcare sector currently,\" they said in a statement while refusing to accept any question from the media. \"We leave the decision to choose the venue to the honourable CM, but it should accommodate representatives of all medical colleges of West Bengal in sufficient numbers,\" the statement read.

When Gamnabhai Solanki, a resident of Malgaon near Lambadiya in Poshina taluka of Sabarkantha, sought Banjari Devi\u2019s hand in marriage on May 30, he was accompanied by their sons, daughters, and grandchildren! Gamnabhai is 75 years old and Banjari Devi is 72 and they are marrying five decades after having children. Both were in a \u2018live-in\u2019 relationship in this tribal town. Live-in relationships may be common in cosmopolitan cities, but for the tribal community of Dungri Garasiya Bhil, it\u2019s a way of life. Weddings here are considered to be an important part of community life, but tribals do not consider it a taboo to cohabit and have children. Frequently, the wedding takes place decades after the couple is engaged with the blessings of both families. Ranjit Solanki, Gamnabhai\u2019s eldest son, who is the father of a son and three daughters, said that he has four brothers and two sisters. \u201cMy parents met in the community fair like many in their generation did, liked each other, and started living together,\u201d he said. \u201cA wedding entails an expense of Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh. Community members, primarily manual and farm labourers, may not have the adequate amount. Thus it takes years for the couple to save money to host a grand feast and perform rituals.\u201d At Kalsavad near Poshina, Vejlibhai Kher excitedly shows his groom\u2019s attire \u2014 complete with headgear, dhoti, starchedwhite shirt and trousers, jewellery, and sword.

Kher, 37, married Jenkiben, 36, on May 30 after living together since 2000. \u201cIt was a grand wedding! My children really enjoyed it and danced throughout the ceremony,\u201d said Kher. \u201cI am associated with farming and it was difficult to collect money for the wedding. We offer jaggery to the woman we like and if she agrees, it\u2019s elopement time!\u201d Knot seldom untied We offer jaggery to the woman we like and if she agrees, it\u2019s elopement time! The families agree to the match and the man and the woman start living as a couple. It\u2019s very common in these parts of Sabarkantha,\" says Vejlibhai Kher The tradition still prevails as even those who stay in other districts come back for the fair and choose their life partners. Elders joke that all weddings here are love marriages. Due to the strong sense of community, there are seldom any disputes leading to the cancellation of the union. On June 4, the wedding of Ishwar Taral, 23, was under way. The groom was accompanied by his three-year-old son Raju. \u201cThe wedding season for many families arrives in May-June when we sell our farm produce,\u201d said Taral. \u201cIf the earning is adequate for the ceremony, the wedding is decided on the spot.

Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said.

Police booked Mevani at Valsad town police station on Thursday for naming a school of Valsad in the video he shared on his Twitter handle on May 20, which shows a student being thrashed by a schoolteacher with a stick. Police suspect Mevani had shared the video along with the text, which was already viral on social media, without caring to check the facts with the people concerned. Mevani has been booked for defamation under Indian Penal Code sections that deal with publishing and circulating of defamatory statement, rumour or report about someone. Police have informed the speaker of state assembly about registration of the offence against Mevani on a complaint lodged by Bijal Patel, principal of RM and VM Desai Sarvajanik Vidyalaya of Valsad. Patel has alleged in her complaint that Mevani shared the video without verifying the facts with them, thus causing damage to the school\u2019s reputation and adversely impacting the confidence of schoolteachers. Police lodged the offence after conducting a preliminary inquiry on receiving the complaint from the school. Mevani along with the video had shared a text titled \u2018Barbarism of worst form\u2019. He named the school and asked his followers on social media to share the message \u201ctill the teacher is terminated and the school gets closed.\u201d \u201cIn that tweet, I had asked the Prime Minister\u2019s Office if the video was real? I had no intention to harm the school\u2019s reputation and ready to say sorry to those hurt thousand times. Police could have asked my explanation before registering the offence. There is more than meets the eye in registration of FIR in the matter. There won\u2019t be any FIR for kicking a woman in public but can be one for tweeting,\u201d said Mevani, claiming that he had shared the video to bring it to the notice of the authorities. Mevani deleted the post from his Twitter handle on May 21 and posted a clarification that he shared the video out of emotion. \u201cWe have booked the MLA and started investigation into the issue. We will register statements of all the concerned and collect evidences after which further action in the matter will be taken,\u201d Valsad district superintendent of police Sunil Joshi told TOI. The video along with text in Hindi is in circulation of social media for the past three years despite the school\u2019s clarifications and protests.

Chief minster Vijay Rupani has already said that guilty will not be spared. There will be no interference in the investigation. If my quitting will solve the problem, I am ready to resign.

There is no dearth of funds when it comes to development work in the country. \"In the last five years, the government has been able to build homes for eight lakh families, light up 3,000 houses and provide gas connections to 40 lakh homes,\" Modi stated. Referring to Mission Shakti, when India demonstrated anti-satellite (ASAT) missile capability by shooting down a live satellite, he said the government has taken measures to set up a 'chowkidar' (watchman) in space. He came down heavily on opposition parties who he said \"belittled\" the space achievement. \"Those that are criticising the anti-satellite technology will be given a befitting reply in the elections,\" he claimed, urging people to vote for a government that can take concrete decisions, not the one that only raises slogans.

Five more, including police inspector Mohanlala Bhagwanram Khileri, are still on the run.Meanwhile, 15 days into the murder case, police are yet to investigate a criminal conspiracy angle between the accused cops and the doctor of New Civil Hospital (NCH). The first doctor who attended victim Omprakash Pandey when he was brought to NCH did not mention injuries in the papers nor named the cops who brought him. While another doctor who came on duty later in the day noticed the injures on Pandey and mentioned it on the papers. This omission has raised doubts that a cover-up was attempted by the accused cops from the initial stage. Their dramatic escape from the police station on May 31 evening was a planned move since they knew that the victim is already dead or that he won\u2019t survive for long. The cops had also shifted Pandey in mysterious circumstances to a private hospital from NCH. Interestingly, both NCH and Unique Hospital where Pandey was later shifted are within Khatodara police station limits. \u201cPolice are yet to register statement of the doctor who noticed injuries on the victim\u2019s body.
