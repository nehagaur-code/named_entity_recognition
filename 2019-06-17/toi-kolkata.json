With the last few days\u2019 reports of patients having to return without treatment or seek admission elsewhere, most people have stopped visiting government hospitals, well aware that they won\u2019t get medical services during the cease-work. Though the emergency department at NRS Hospital started functioning since Friday morning, the infrastructure and manpower have remained inadequate to handle patients. On Saturday morning, family members of at least four patients, who came to the emergency, decided to take them to a private nursing home. The driveway in front of the emergency department at Medical College and Hospital, which is usually spilling with people visiting the hospital, looked abandoned. The fair price medicine shop at NRS Medical College and Hospital, where customers have to wait for at least one hour for their turn to buy their medicines, presented a completely different picture, with sales persons relaxing on the other side of the counter and only a handful of buyers approaching them. The night shelters at SSKM Hospital, where family members of patients admitted inside would have to take turns to sleep in the limited space, saw persons lying sprawled on the benches, a luxury unimaginable at other times. Veteran doctors could not recall when was the last time they witnessed so few footfalls at government hospitals. \u201cGovernment hospitals play a vital role in dispensing healthcare facilities to millions of people in the state. Every day, lakhs of people visit the five big hospitals in the city for treatment and check-ups. These facilities, which are stretched to the limits when it comes to infrastructure and manpower, function round the clock and it is not surprising to find four to five thousand people camping inside the hospital at any given point of time on any day. This is perhaps for the first time that government hospitals in the city are seeing so few patients,\u201d said a physician, who has worked in several of these hospitals over the past 20 years. On an average, close to 20,000 people visit the big government hospitals daily to avail of medical services at emergency, OPD, pathology departments and for consultations and surgeries. Most of these services have been hit hard due to the cease-work launched by junior doctors, who don\u2019t seem to be ready to lift their agitation till their demands are met with. A junior doctor at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital pointed out that patients who visited the hospitals on Wednesday and Thursday were caught unawares. But by Saturday, the news had spread that government hospitals were barely functioning. \u201cMost people are either not coming to Kolkata for treatment or going directly to private establishments as the crisis is yet to be resolved,\u201d the doctor said.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

He got into NRS right after his Class XII, without losing an academic year. A keen student in the surgical classes during his MBBS course, his colleagues said Mukhopadhyay wanted to study surgery after finishing his internship. \u201cRight now he has some issues with his vision and has a little trouble balancing himself.

Though the chief minister did not visit Prabaha and there was no official communication from the state secretariat or Trinamool leadership conforming the visit. The activities at the hospital did rekindle hopes of a solution to the stalemate between the state government and the junior doctors over resuming the health services that have been in suspension since Tuesday. Senior police officers reached the hospital around 1 pm and held a small meeting with the officials of INK about the visit. Guardrails were wheeled in to cordon off the area leading to the back gate. \u201cWhen the chief minister comes she will go up from the lift at the back so that the patients in the outdoor are not disturbed,\u201d said a senior police officer. Representatives of the hospital came down to the ground floor to guide the chief minister to Prabaha\u2019s room who is recuperating in room 619 on the sixth floor of the hospital.

Nasima Laskar, 34, was in dire need of blood on Saturday as she was bleeding severely from her uterus. Given the total collapse in the medical services across the state, her husband Amin Ali Laskar was at his wit\u2019s end and had almost given up when the doctors stepped in. \u201cOn Friday, my wife needed two units of blood and I could arrange for two donors.

We will continue to do so in future as well,\u201d said Sharma. While two units were transfused on Saturday itself, one unit has been kept in the blood bank for use by any other patient in the hospital. Nasima had given birth to a stillborn in a government hospital a few weeks ago and doctors found an infection in the uterus to be the cause of the bleeding. Since attempts to control the bleeding failed, they explored the site and determined that hysterectomy was the best treatment option. \u201cThe patient is a beta thalassemia carrier and her haemoglobin count was 7.5. The surgery was an emergency and it could not have been carried out without the blood units. I am proud of my students who have risen above the agitation to save a life.

In most government hospitals, it is always the junior doctors who take maximum work load. Tackling so many patients is not a joke. On top of that, they are asked several questions by the patient's family, who at times get restless and abusive. Personally, I haven't faced a situation like what happened at the NRS. Before beating up doctors, you should remember that they are the ones who save our lives. They sacrifice a lot to serve us. Juniors doctors are always on call at night, which is not an easy life to lead! They don't deserve such bashing. The incident that happened at NRS was inhuman. It's unfortunate that so much time has been wasted over venue selection instead of solving the problem of doctors' safety.

Ultadanga resident Madhu Bhattacharya (55), who was brought in an ambulance after he began frothing at the mouth, remained in the vehicle before being driven away after doctors said they could not provide the necessary care. Urmila Devi (45) of Dum Dum, who was wheeled into the emergency with chest pain and burning sensation all over, was also taken away after being attended to for five minutes. The scene was no different at SSKM Hospital. Joynagar resident Dhananjoy Purakayastha (10) got his fractured hand plastered a month ago. The fracture has healed but no doctor has removed his plaster. Emergency department doctors said it would be removed only at the OPD, which was now shut. Kidderpore resident Alija Khatoon (2) had burnt her hand in hot water on Monday. A doctor at the SSKM emergency department had applied first aid, prescribed antibiotics and an ointment and asked her parents to bring her for a check-up on Saturday. The family claimed the doctors took a cursory glance and asked them to continue the ointment. Phoolbagan resident Arian Ali Biswas was referred to SSKM Hospital from BC Roy Children\u2019s Hospital. The eight-month-old on drip and saline has been unable to eat for a week and has grown extremely weak. Doctors at BC Roy could not diagnose the problem and referred the child to SSKM, where doctors allegedly asked them to return to BC Roy.

Talking about the scrutiny of bills, he said: \u201cWe have told the government that in the last five years, 25% of bills were scrutinised by the Parliamentary Committees before these were passed.\u201d \u201cAs much as 75% of bills were scrutinised in the first 60 years. In the 16th LS, only 25% underwent parliamentary scrutiny. So, we suggested that at least 75% should be scrutinised by the Standing Committee,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cBetween 1977 and 2005, out of 10 bills two were ordinances. But, in the last one year, there were four ordinances out of 10 bills. So, I request the government to not use the ordinance route.

According to a traffic cop, who was on duty in the area, a large chunk of the road suddenly caved in around 7am near Daspara. The subsidence caused traffic congestion as it was the peak hour. Traffic slowed to a crawl and vehicles had to be diverted as the Kolkata Municipal Corporation cordoned off the area for restoration of the road. Times ViewTraffic is still a problem in the zone during peak hours, despite the best efforts of traffic cops and planners, following the collapse of the Majerhat bridge. Special care must be taken of all major roads leading to and out of Behala.Later officials from Kolkata Environment Improvement Project (KEIP) reached the spot to oversee the condition of the caved in road. According to a senior KEIP official, the subsidence occurred due to a void in the soil underground created after the laying of a sewer line under James Long Sarani. \"Preliminary investigations revealed that a portion of James Long Sarani caved-in near Daspara following the laying of a sewer line by KEIP to connect it to another sewerage under an adjacent lane, which experiences floods every year during monsoon. A void in the soil level created for want of proper compaction led to the subsidence,\" the official conceded. KEIP engaged engineers and skilled labourers to repair the road and finally managed to wrap up the work late in the night. \"We will examine the road again tomorrow,\" a KMC roads department official said. Sources in the department said the KEIP top brass were alerted over the recurrence of such incidents because of the approaching monsoon that may create troubles for residents of Behala. \"The KEIP has been engaged to lay sewer lines in areas of Behala where they don't exist. KEIP officials are overseeing the laying of a water supply pipeline that runs underground along James Long Sarani. These two are very vital projects for Behala residents,\" a KMC official said. \"At the same time, if these projects are not executed with precision and extra care, they may take a toll on the major thoroughfares like DH Road or James Long Sarani. We need to be extra careful about the maintenance of roads before monsoon as these may add to waterlogging woes,\" he added.

Each government hospital spawns an ecosystem that provides basic services, such as affordable food, charging of mobile phones and even shelters, where patients\u2019 family members stay temporarily or take rest. With the strike of junior doctors entering its fifth day paralysing all healthcare facilities in these hospitals, very few patients have been visiting the hospitals, which in turn, has dealt a blow to these businesses. Medical stores, including the fair price shops, opposite the government hospitals, which are forever brimming with customers, wore an abandoned look on Saturday. Gautam Patra run a unique business on the Medical College and Hospital premises. He allows patients and their families to charge their mobiles at his stall in exchange for certain amounts. But even he has had hardly any customer in the past three days. \u201cMy business has been hit badly. It is down by almost 95%,\u201d said Patra, who charges Rs 10 for each mobile. \u201cMy business depends on people who visit the hospital and stay here for a few days. They need to speak to their relatives back home for which they need to keep their phones charged. As most of them spend the nights either on the compound or somewhere makeshift, they don\u2019t have any place to charge their phones. They come to me.\u201d Ajay Jaiswal, who has a medical store opposite Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, has reported a daily sales slide of almost 80% since junior doctors went on strike on Tuesday. \u201cTill Monday, there would be close to 200 prescriptions a day. The number has come down to 10 to 15 now. Most of the times, we are sitting idle. I have eight people working in my shop. I hope the hospitals resume normal services soon,\u201d said Jaiswal. Gauri Shankar Pharmacy opposite RG Kar Hospital, which stocks crticial care medicines, was deserted. \u201cThe entire business has come to a standstill. We have never seen such a bad phase ever before. We are completely dependent on R G Kar Hospital for customers,\u201d said the owner. Ambulances, which ferry patients from one hospital to another or back home, have gone out of business. Close to 100 ambulances have been parked outside Medical College and Hospital since Tuesday but none has been requisitioned. \u201cSome of us have not got even a single trip since the strike started on Tuesday. On a normal day, each one of us get four to five trips from outside this busy hospital,\u201d said Sanu Manna, an ambulance driver. Pushpa Mitra runs a food kiosk just beside the emergency department at NRS Hospital. On any given day, medical representatives, patients\u2019 families and even doctors throng her shop for tea and sandwich. \u201cThere have hardly been any sales since Tuesday,\u201d said Mitra.

Sunday being a holiday, the out-patient departments remained closed and the number of patients waiting outside hospitals or visiting the emergency wards was also low. The emergency services, however, functioned normally. The striking doctors across hospitals were looking forward to a General Body meeting to be held at the NRS Medical College and Hospital, the epicentre of the protests. The meeting, which will decide the next course of action, will also be attended by representatives of other hospitals participating in the strike. According to informed sources, the protesting doctors are probably looking for a scope of discussion to end the stalemate. On Friday night, the striking doctors rejected Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's proposal for talks at the state Secretariat, instead asking her to come down to NRS Hospital. West Bengal Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi wrote to Banerjee advising her to take immediate steps to provide security to the doctors and asking her to take them into confidence. She responded saying that the government was taking required action. \"The protest is not just about CCTV, armed security and iron gates. As a doctor, I know the difficulties faced by doctors due to lack of infrastructure at these hospitals,\" said Sayantan Bandopadhyay. Bandopadhyay is relative of doctor Paribaha Mukherjee, who was attacked up by the kin of a 75-year-old patient who died, allegedly of medical negligence, at NRS Hospital late on Monday night. The attack triggered off the strike by the doctors that has since brought medical services in the state to a standstill. \"I appeal the doctors to resume their work as I don't want innocent patients to die,\" said Mohammed Shabir, a relative of the deceased patient.

Police said Basu used the alias \u2018Mita Chatterjee\u2019 to lodge complaints against local builders who undertook illegal constructions in the neighbourhood. Once these complaints got lodged at local courts, municipal and governing bodies, and even police, he would reportedly extort money to \u2018settle matters\u2019. \u201cWe have found he was named in complaints before. It was only about three years ago that he had reformed himself. Hence, there is a possibility that he had made several enemies,\u201d an investigating officer said. Cops said the victim was also receiving freedom-fighter\u2019s dependent\u2019s pension, which was his only source of income. Inside the house, there were just two rooms. One room was unfit for habitation, the other was where Basu lived. \u201cNo valuable could be found. So, we have ruled out a robbery angle. There were some other claimants to this pension and, therefore, a personal enmity seems the most plausible reason behind the murder. We still believe someone close to the family or within it is involved,\u201d he said. The interrogation of a shop owner, who would regularly scale the boundary wall to fetch the keys when Basu went to sleep locking the door from inside, provided some valuable leads. \u201cNo one took his help on that day to enter the house.

Bus operators suspected the miscreants were the ones who, backed by a political party, asked for extortion money in lieu of their parking spaces on government land.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

The North Port police was informed and a team of divers from the disaster management group joined the rescue operation. Till late evening, Lahiri\u2019s body was yet to be recovered,\u201d said DC (Port) Syed Waquar Raza. \u201cLahiri is a resident of the southern suburbs of Kolkata. He had sought permission from both Kolkata Police and the Kolkata Port Trust. He had clearly mentioned the act was to happen on a boat or vessel and there was no connection with water. Hence, we allowed him permission. However, he did vaguely mention an \u2018extra act\u2019, which he did not clarify. We are investigating,\u201d Raza added. In 2013, facing assault from the mob, he had said he was merely trying to popularise the art of magic. \u201cMandrake had been put into a sixfoot-tall cage with six locks. It was to go 30 feet under water. Even as a crane lowered the cage into the river, thousands watched from the Howrah bridge and the launch jetty in Howrah. About six seconds later, Mandrake emerged from the water and climbed on to a launch. Soon after he reached the Howrah ferry ghat, he was surrounded by people who claimed they were cheated. The cage, they claimed, was fitted with a false door that was easily visible,\u201d one of the cops from the river traffic department recalled. But that wasn\u2019t Mandrake\u2019s first magic misadventure. Almost a decade earlier, he had declared that he would walk on the Hooghly waters, but had to beat a hasty retreat when the performance went wrong.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

The temperature, however, climbed down a little after a thunderstorm struck the city in the evening, triggered by local clouds generated by the intense heat, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). But the heat will return and the maximum temperature could spiral again, remaining close to 40\u00b0C till Monday, it was predicted. The mercury jumped nearly three-and-half degrees on Friday even as warm northwesterly winds flowed into Gangetic Bengal. They wiped out the relatively cooler easterly winds that carry in moisture from the sea and help to keep the mercury in check. \u201cThere has been little rain over the last fortnight and the region has no rain-triggering system at the moment. A low-pressure trough that stretched from Rajasthan to northeast India had generated a squall on Wednesday. But it didn\u2019t have an impact on the day temperature since the trough has now disappeared. Heat-wave conditions now prevail across most of north India and the winds are carrying in the heat from there. There will be no respite for the next 72 hours,\u201d said RMC director GK Das. Friday\u2019s heat, however, generated local cloud cells in Jharkhand that sailed towards Kolkata. It led to a thunderstorm accompanied by winds that brought relief at the end of a searing day. The storm stuck Kolkata, Howrah and South 24 Parganas with a maximum wind speed of 45 km/hr and was followed by a steady drizzle lasted nearly an hour. \u201cLocal clouds triggered the moderate thunderstorm. It brought the mercury down and will keep the maximum temperature in check on Saturday. But the relief will be temporary,\u201d said Das. The highest temperature recorded so far this year was 37.9\u00b0C on May 6. Even though thunderstorms have been rare since May, the mercury never touched 38\u00b0C. Last year, though, the highest temperature recorded in Kolkata was 40.6\u00b0C on June 18, after monsoon had set in. There was, however, no indication of monsoon arriving in south Bengal. North Bengal, though, may receive monsoon in the next two-three days. \u201cThe monsoon arm has an impact on north Bengal could get active this week,\u201d said Das.

Two police vans were damaged, prompting a lathicharge. In another development in North 24 Parganas, four persons were arrested at Sa-ndeshkhali over a triple murder in the area on June 9. The arrests came a day after a National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) bench condemned \u2018police inaction\u2019 over the killings. Police said Akher Ali Gayen, a prime accused named in the FIR, was arrested with Javed Ali Mollah, Mainuddin Mollah and Maizuddinn Mollah. All four are Trinamool Congress supporters. However, TMC Sandeshkhali block I president Seikh Sahajahan, another prime accused, is on the run. On June 8, three persons were killed in a late-night cl-ash between TMC and BJP workers at Bhangipara near Nazat in Sandeshkhali. Two of them were BJP supporters (including SC Morcha district president Pradip Mondal) and one a TMC supporter. At least five BJP supporters went missing. On Friday, besides the victims\u2019 families, a five-member team led by NCSC chairman Ram Shankar Katheria and vice-chairman L Murugan visited the homes of the missing at Bhangipara and Hatgachi villages. It set a 7-day deadline for police to trace the missing since the day of the post-poll violence. Katheria also instructed ADG (law and order) Vishal Garg and Basirhat SP K Sabari Rajkumar, who accompanied the team, to arrange for permanent pickets.

The state fire services department on Friday refused clearances to two stations on the route because exits on the eastern side of EM Bypass haven\u2019t been built, thanks to resistance from slum-dwellers at Duttabad. Earlier, people from the same slum had blocked 365m of viaduct construction along EM Bypass for five years. And the original blueprint along the stretch was changed, reducing 13 piers to seven since the modification affected fewer settlers. This time, Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), the agency implementing the project, has submitted undertaking by the state urban development department to the fire department about the land issue coming in the way of building the third emergency exit at Bengal Chemical and Salt Lake Stadium stations. But the fire department, after a meeting of its decision-making committee on Friday, told KMRC that the third exit is a must for fire safety clearance.

Banerjee ruled out going to the NRS Medical College and Hospital campus as demanded by the striking junior doctors, but told them that the government was against taking any coercive action \u2014 like arrests or imposition of the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) \u2014 to get them to work. The appeal to striking doctors in the name of \u201chumanity\u201d pitted the strike against doctors\u2019 commitment to their patients and reminded the agitators how \u201cthousands of common citizens were suffering\u201d bec-ause of the strike. Banerjee\u2019s appeal to the striking doctors follows Friday\u2019s unsuccessful attempt by five senior doctors, held in high esteem in the medical fraternity but also \u201ctrusted\u201d by the establishment, to get the agitators to Nabanna. Saturday\u2019s appeal by the CM was again rebuffed by junior doctors at NRS, the starting point and the epicentre of the agitation, but it indicated a change in tack in the administration\u2019s efforts to end the strike that continued into the fifth day. Implicit in Banerjee\u2019s press conference on Saturday evening was an attempt to present the administration as reasonable and flexible and willing to negotiate, even with \u201cyoung students\u201d who might be intransigent and hot-headed at times. The attempt to portray striking junior doctors as a divided house \u2014 between those \u201cwilling to resume work\u201d and others \u2014 came through in a dramatic interlude in the press conference, which was suspended for a few minutes as the CM went to her cabin to meet \u201csome willing junior doctors from across medical colleges\u201d who had come to assure her that they would \u201cjoin work\u201d. \u201cA group of 10 junior doctors came to meet me and said they are willing to join duty. We will support and protect them. Once some junior doctors join work, others will follow and the strike will implode,\u201d the CM said after the dramatic interlude. One of the doctors whose name was doing the rounds as having met Banerjee at Nabanna posted a denial on social media. \u201cThere is a false rumour that I meet with CM want breakup this apolitical movement. It\u2019s completely false allegation (sic),\u201d the Facebook post read. The striking junior doctors were also quick to refute the CM\u2019s claim that some of them had gone to meet her. \u201cNo junior doctor went to meet her. She has not focused on our valid demands. We want her to come to NRS and listen to us to take certain steps. We are eagerly waiting to serve the ailing people,\u201d a junior doctor at NRS read out from a drafted statement soon after the CM\u2019s presser. In the press meet, Banerjee said all demands of the striking doctors had been accepted and termed the attack on them as unfortunate. \u201cI had sent my ministers, principal secretary to meet the doctors, waited for 5 hours to meet their delegation yesterday and today, but they did not come. You have to give respect to the constitutional body,\u201d she said, reiterating that the junior doctors were still welcome to come to Nabanna and meet her. She also reminded the striking doctors that despite the existence of ESMA that had been used in nine states \u2014 including Gujarat \u2014 to crack down on strikes that disrupted essential services, she had desisted from enforcing it. \u201cWe never arrested a single person, we didn\u2019t arrest a single doctor, we didn\u2019t clamp ESMA. This government has a human face. I have seen reports that patients in Midnapore and Murshidabad have died without treatment. I went to SSKM Hospital after I got an SOS from a patient urging me to start the Emergency ward. I was pushed. They abused me. I kept my cool and asked police against taking any action. This government has a human face,\u201d the chief minister said. The CM also outlined steps that had been taken to enhance the security of doctors. \u201cThere will be a security audit of all medical colleges. Each hospital will have an assistant commissioner level officer in charge of security there,\u201d she said, adding that she was ready to accommodate other demands as well and even suggested that the striking doctors could meet with the Governor or chief secretary if they wished to end the impasse. Brushing aside a question posed to her on mass resignation by doctors at medical colleges and hospitals across the state, she said it (mass resignation) was a tool to register protest in a democracy that didn\u2019t mean anything. Almost 1000 doctors have resigned in the state en mass since Thursday evening. The CM\u2019s press conference came after a dramatic day that began with hope when senior doctors at RG Kar Medical College made an impassioned appeal to agitating juniors to withdraw the stir that has paralyzed at least 13 big government hospitals across the state. This was further buttressed when word got around that the CM had decided to visit Dr Paribaha Mukhopadhyay, one of the two doctors injured in the NRS attack on Monday night that triggered the strike. But the opportunity quickly dissipated following a statement by an Indian Medical Association functionary that left junior doctors fuming and led to the cancellation of CM\u2019s hospital visit. IMA all-India president Shantanu Sen, who met administrators, senior doctors and police at NRS to discuss how the stir could be resolved and addressed protesting junior doctors at the general body meeting emerged to comment there were \u201coutsiders\u201d with vested interest who were inciting the junior doctors to keep the crisis alive. \u201cI saw outsiders, doctors who had already passed out, in the GB meeting,\u201d he said. The comments firmly shut the window to a resolution with junior doctors denouncing the statement and reiterating the decision to not meet the CM at Nabanna on Saturday evening. Later, the junior doctors issued a statement: \u201cYesterday, the DME had verbally informed us that CM has asked us to meet her in her office. Following the statements made by the CM in the past two days, we are upset and apprehensive regarding our representatives meeting with her behind closed doors. That is why, we are not sending any representatives to her office. Right from the beginning, we have said we are open to a healthy discussion to find a solution to meet our demands. We want to make this very clear that we are deeply concerned about the sufferings of common people. We want an urgent solution to this situation by ensuring proper security and safety at work place as per our demands. We shall resume our duties as soon as our demands are met. We humbly request the CM to meet all of us at NRS and discuss and implement all our demands at the earliest.\u201d With the deadlock persisting, Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi wrote to Banerjee duriung the day, urging her to meet the doctors and assure them on providing adequate security and to look into their grievances. The Governor had written to the CM on Friday as well outlining the demands and grievances of the doctors and their willingness to resume duty when these were redressed. Banerjee later said she had spoken to the Governor on the issue. During the day, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued another advisory to the Bengal government on the ongoing strike by doctors and sought a report on the matter urgently. The advisory followed a letter from IMA to Union home minister Amit Shah demanding enactment of a central law to check violence against healthcare workers in hospitals.

The autumn-winter collection that the designers showcased in Kolkata on Sunday, set new benchmarks in men\u2019s couture wear. An ode to the past: The collection, \u2018The Prince Unknown\u2019, took inspiration from the bygone era, but the balance of contemporary and traditional was well achieved in the designs that were all about structured silhouettes, drapes and layers. Says Shantanu, \u201cWe have always been inspired by the pre-Independence era. Through this collection, we revisited the palaces and had an insight into the lives of royalty. The princes and kings had a charming appeal and were known for their unique and classic style. They were fearless, indulgent and knew what luxury is. We wanted to show that prince and rulers in the past had a life which pretty much had the motto of work hard, party harder. So the fearless attitude is reflected in the structured silhouettes. There was also a bit of feminine touch through the drapes and layered effect. We used a lot of raw silk, jerseys to create that fall and effect in drapes and layers in kurtas.\u201d Of Nehru jackets and waistcoats: From rich tones like royal blue and maroon to subtle shades like beiges, brown and grey, the collection presented a mix of shades. Muted embroidery on jackets, texturing and fine detailing were noteworthy. Layered kurtas, bandhgalas, sherwanis with churidaars were part of the collection. The designers paid a lot of attention to jackets. \u201cThis time the emphasis is on our love for Nehru collars. Nehru collar was given different shapes, some rather high and some were kept in their natural form \u2013 something that we are used to seeing. Then there were variations in jacket lengths. There were cropped jackets, waist coats, bandhgalas and sherwanis with lengths kissing your knee and with high slits so that one can see the drama at the bottom. It was a jacket-focused collection and textures were very tone-on-tone. There was a hint of understated luxury throughout the collection,\u201d says Shantanu.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

With the government still grappling to solve the impasse, the number of resignations may shoot further up on Monday. In RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, the epicentre of mass resignation, the list grew longer with 18 more deciding to quit from their position. On Friday, 107 doctors from the hospital had signed the mass resignation letter. \u201cThe resignation letter, signed by 125 doctors, including many department heads and senior faculty members, was submitted to the college authority on Saturday. \u201d confirmed a RG Kar doctor. Of the 250 faculty members at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital (CNMCH), 125 have already tendered their resignation. It had started with doctors of the dermatology department calling it quits on Friday. On Saturday, doctors from other departments, including general surgery, medicine, chest and orthopaedics, joined their colleagues. \u201cAll 125 are senior faculty members. The number could go up if the impasse continues. We are looking forward to the government and senior health officials to take up some sincere initiative,\u201d said a senior faculty member at CNMCH. At Bankura Sammilani Medical College, 23 faculty members submitted their resignation to the principal on Saturday. An official of the college said these faculty members are having to put in extra hours, some of them staying back in the hospital to tend to in-house patients. \u201cWith the junior doctors shunning work, it has become impossible to run the services even for indoor patients. The faculty members were forced to submit their resignation because of infrastructure collapse,\u201d said a hospital official. When the news of the CM\u2019s possible visit to Paribaha Mukhopadhyay circulated on Saturday afternoon, there was hope among senior doctors. They were looking forward to the CM\u2019s visit acting as an ice-breaker. \u201cWhen the impasse ends is now in CM\u2019s hands. All that is required to end the logjam is a visit by the CM to the agitating doctors at NRS. How long will she take for that? These young doctors need kind words to heal their wounds,\u201d said a senior faculty of Bankura Sammilani Medical College. In Nadia\u2019s Kalyani, 40 doctors, including faculty and senior doctors of the College of Medicine and Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital, submitted a mass resignation letter to the principal on Saturday, confirmed the hospital\u2019s superintendent, Abhijit Mukherjee. Similarly, 26 senior doctors submitted resignation letters to principal Panchanan Kundu at Midnapore Medical College and Hospital. \u201cWe were hopeful when five highly respected doctors went to meet the CM on Friday. But nothing came of it. The CM will win hearts and respect if she meets junior doctors at NRS. I hope this happens soon,\u201d said a senior doctor of Medical College Hospital, Calcutta.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Though the weather update from Old Trafford \u2014 the match venue \u2014 is not very exciting (there is a possibility of rain), no one is allowing it to dampen the spirit of the build-up to a thrilling World Cup encounter.

The driveway in front of the emergency department in Medical College and Hospital, Calcutta which is normally encroached by people visiting the hospital wore an abandoned look. The fair price medicine shop at NRS Medical College and Hospital, where people must wait for atleast one hour for their turn, presented a completely different picture with sales persons relaxing on the other side of the counter and customers few and far between. The night shelters in SSKM Hospital where family members of patients admitted in the hospital would take turns to sleep due to the rush, now spot a vacant look with only a handful of people sprawling on the benches. Veteran doctors could not recall when was the last time the government hospitals wore such a deserted look. \u201cThe government hospitals play a very vital role in dispensing health care facilities to millions of people in the state. Every day lakhs of people visit the five big hospitals in the city for treatment and check-ups. These hospitals which are stretched to the limits when it comes to infrastructure and manpower function round the clock and it is not surprising to find four to five thousand people camping inside the hospital at any given point of time. This is perhaps for the first time that all government hospitals in the city are looking so devoid of people,\u201d said a senior physician who has worked in several of these hospitals over the last twenty years. On an average close to 20,000 people visit the big government hospitals daily to avail of several services like emergency, OPD, pathological services and surgeries. But most of these services have been hit hard due to cease work of junior doctors who are protesting the attack on their colleagues in NRS Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday night. The patients visiting the hospitals on Wednesday and Thursday were caught unawares. But by Saturday the news had spread that the government hospitals are shut which has reduced the flow of patients. \u201cMost people are either not coming to Kolkata or directly going to private nursing homes or hospitals for treatment as the crisis is yet to be resolved,\u201d said a junior doctor at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.

These measures are part of several long- and short-term measures being worked on by the Lalbazar brass. The state\u2019s repeated assurances to act tough against such offenders have, till now, failed to placate the protesters. The city cops are examining whether fresh penal charges can be slapped against repeat offenders involved in assault on doctors over the past two years. According to senior officers, Kolkata Police is examining all cases involving assault of doctors in the past two years in government and private hospitals. \u201cThe primary idea is to reach the trial stage quickly,\u201d said a senior officer. \u201cThe cops are also coordinating with the Directorate of Prosecutions (DoP) to expedite trial in cases where the chargesheet has already been filed.\u201d Sources said cases that are still under investigation will be monitored closely by the detective department for quick probes and follow-ups in a time-bound manner.

The cops have drawn up fresh charges and plan to record the statements of the injured doctors once they recover to explore whether harsher charges \u2014 including attempt to murder \u2014 can be drawn up. The case is likely to be handed over to the detective department once the preliminary probe is completed by the Entally police, said a senior officer. Police commissioner Anuj Sharma, who visited the NRS hospital on Tuesday immediately after the attack on the doctors and vandalism on Monday night, has held several discussions with senior officers and the health department to work on these legal and administrative measures. The cops, who are closely working with the state health department on the hospital security audit, are re-examining whether more closed-circuit cameras can be installed in and around emergency and outpatients\u2019 departments, subject to the hospitals\u2019 approval. \u201cThere is a proposal for joint inspection by hospital authorities and the police to come up with a concrete plan for access control in the hospitals to contain movement of public on the hospital premises,\u201d a senior officer said. Statistically, doctors have mostly been assaulted mostly in emergency departments. \u201cThere is also a proposal for police outposts at all hospitals to be upgraded and for those to be better coordinated with hospital security staff, which is under the administrative control of the hospital authorities,\u201d said another source.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

Even though their OPDs will remain open, most private hospitals expect few doctors to attend. Patient turnout, too, will be consequently low, they believe. Half the doctors at a private hospital off EM Bypass has already taken leave from their outdoor duties on Monday. Patient attendance across private hospital OPDs dropped since the doctors\u2019 stir began last Tuesday. At Ruby General Hospital, the authorities apprehend that less than 50% doctors would report to work on Monday. \u201cIt will affect the services and we expect a thin patient attendance, too. OPD services have remained affected for the last five days and Monday could be the worst,\u201d said GM, operations, Subhashish Dutta. Medica Superspecialty Hospital authorities, too, think that most doctors would stay away. \u201cThis strike call was given a couple of days ago, so the response will be good. Most doctors are likely to join the cease-work on Monday and we can\u2019t insist they report to work. But we will try and ensure that all patients get attended to,\u201d said CEO Alok Roy. Outdoor services at all the three units of AMRI Hospitals are likely to come to a halt. The hospital is, however, making arrangements to attend to critically ill patients at its outdoors. \u201cAll our emergency staff and staff doctors will be present. If necessary, we will take their help to attend to serious patients. But most OPD doctors are likely to be absent on Monday and it will affect services,\u201d said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. He added that around 70% doctors could join the cease-work. \u201cWe expect our doctors to inform us on Monday morning about their decision,\u201d he said. AMRI receives around 800 OPD patients across its three centres at Mukundapur, Salt Lake and Dhakuria. During last week\u2019s OPD strike call, patient attendance had dropped to 30%. It could slide further on Monday, felt Barua. An AMRI Hospitals consultant, who had joined the cease-work on Wednesday, said he feared OPDs would collapse on Monday. \u201cThe agitation has gained momentum over the last three days. The entire medical community is now rallying around junior doctors. While last Wednesday, the number of OPD patients was slightly fewer than normal, this time, the facilities could be deserted,\u201d he said. Apollo Gleneagles Hospital CEO Rana Dasgupta refused to speculate on doctor attendance and said the hospital authorities were keeping their fingers crossed. A consultant with the hospital, however, felt that none of the doctors might report for duty at the outdoor on Monday. \u201cThe situation has gone from bad to worse. This is a national strike and all Kolkata doctors will take part. Outdoor services are likely to come to a standstill at private hospitals,\u201d he said. Belle Vue Clinic received just 55 outdoor patients, instead of the normal 300, during the OPD strike last Thursday. But patient count improved on Friday and Saturday. It is set to slide again on Monday.  \u201cWe have not been informed of any cease-work by doctors but the patient and doctor attendance indeed dropped last Thursday,\u201d said CEO P Tondon. Paediatrician Shantanu Ray, who took part in the OPD cease-work last week, felt the strike could provide an impetus to the agitation. \u201cDoctors have lost focus after the NRS incident. We are working again for it is our duty to serve patients. But this is not a healthy situation. Doctors need to feel safe and secure to do their best. They now have their backs to the wall,\u201d said Ray.

Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The Italian firm has almost completed 800 trials now and the system is in place for CRS inspection. \u201cIt\u2019s a major milestone for us that Kolkata\u2019s second Metro line was given the ISA clearance from the \u2018third party\u2019 assessor,\u201d Anup K Kundu, director, rolling stock, KMRC, told TOI on Saturday. The ISA consultant was chosen through a global bid floated earlier by KMRC. The French team assessed mainly the signalling and integration of automatic train control with the Operation Control Centre \u2014 East-West\u2019s futuristic control room capable of running driverless trains. \u201cWe can now invite the CRS for inspection,\u201d Kundu said. Now that Certifier has given the ISA clearance, all safety the documents will be scrutinized by CRS at its Lucknow headquarters.

At SSKM hospital in Kolkata, Raiganj-resident Samuel Haque, who was admitted with a cardiac problem, said he was uncertain about his treatment. His brother said, \"We came to Kolkata last Sunday when everything was normal and the outpatient department was functioning. We admitted him on an emergency basis, with doctors giving date on Tuesday for check-up, following which the date of surgery was to be decided.\" But now no doctor is attending to Haque, he said. Senior doctors say they don't have enough hands to conduct tests, he said. \"His condition is deteriorating. We cannot take him home because it is very difficult for my brother to travel long distance in trains. We will wait till Monday.\" Services in emergency wards, outdoor facilities and pathological units of many hospitals have been hit. The doctor's strike began after two of their colleagues were assaulted at the NRS Medical College and Hospital by family members of a patient, who died on Monday night. They demand adequate security. Hundreds of doctors have resigned en masse in support of their colleagues. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has urged the junior doctors to return to work and said her government had accepted their demands. But the doctors have demanded a dialogue with the government before ending their stir. The strike has caused immense trouble for patients. Joydeb Roy, a resident of Barishat in North 24 Parganas district, was admitted to R G Kar hospital in Kolkata with an injured leg. A relative said he was referred to a government hospital, where he had to undergo surgery to place a metallic plate in his leg on an emergency-basis. He is waiting for the surgery. \"The senior doctors are saying they need help of junior doctors to conduct the surgery. My husband is lying in the department (ward) waiting for treatment,\" Roy's wife said. Junior doctors are the mainstay of any state-run college-hospital. Mokhtar Hussain's family members are planning to return home in Basirhat. They have been waiting for two days at the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital for treatment to resume for Hussain, a cancer patient. \"I am suffering from high fever for seven days. I cannot bear the pain. But there is no doctor to carry out check-up. The OPD has been shut for two days and I cannot go anywhere else as things are the same there as well. I don't know what to do. I cannot spend this much money to stay here in Kolkata. I will go back home,\" he said. Family members of the four-year-old Romita Dhar, a thalassaemia patient, too face a similar dilemma. When Dhar's family took her to Chittaranjan National Medical College and Hospital for check-up on Friday, they were told to come on Saturday. \"It is very difficult to travel with a child who is suffering from thalassaemia. I'll again come next week,\" her mother Arundhaty Roy said. The patients admitted in government hospitals are also facing problems with pathological units not functioning as usual. \"We don't have much money to afford treatment at private hospitals. I appeal to the chief minister to find a solution to this problem. \"Why cannot our chief minister come for a meeting with the doctors... They (junior doctors) have been saying they will end the stir if she comes to the NRS hospital for a meeting,\" mother of Bastab Dasgupta, who suffers from neurological problem and is admitted at NRS Medical College and Hospital, said.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

A little before midnight on Saturday, junior doctors came out with a statement claiming they were ready for the talk, but were indecisive about the venue. The doctors, who sympathized with the patients who weren\u2019t receiving treatment, said they were ready to start a dialogue with the state but refused to accept the \u201cclosed-door meeting\u201d suggested by the CM. Banerjee had appealed to agitating doctors to join the negotiating table at Nabanna. During that time, different views started coming up from several sections of the protesters inside the U N Brahmachari Building. The pressure to soften their stand and find a middle ground was already mounting and a section of the doctors suggested holding the talk in presence of Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi. A big section of the agitating doctors, however, decided to wait till Sunday morning to decide on the venue at a general body meeting. Meanwhile, fears of a fresh attack gripped a section of the students at NRS Hospital as rumours started spreading after photographs of a group of men jostling outside the hospital\u2019s main gate was shared across social networking platforms. \u201cSome of the students were scared, but nothing untoward happened on Saturday night,\u201d a junior doctor said.

The caller also suggested the chief minister\u2019s offer to initiate talks at Raj Bhavan can be helpful in breaking the impasse. Ghosh, however, said the voice in the clip was not hers and she later lodged a complaint with the Kolkata Police and the CID. The general body meeting started at 11am on Sunday in the Academic Building hall where students started placing their views. A section of them agreed to hold the dialogue at Nabanna to end the impasse. Another section insisted on holding the meeting at Raj Bhavan.

More than 200 members of the LGBTQIA+ community marched the streets waving rainbow-coloured flags, shouting slogans, flaunting their painted nails and demanding equal love. At least 100 amateur photographers captured the walk with cameras in hand. The first edition of The Rainbow Frame \u2014 a pride and photo walk \u2014 was a celebration of those who are out and proud. Organised by Fotograf\u00eda-En, a Facebook community for amateur photographers, the walk aimed at celebrating the Pride Month \u2014 June \u2014 and build a healthy relationship between the LGBTQIA+ community members and the other strata of society. Aparajita Majumdar, the founder of the group and the main organiser of the walk, wore a big smile as she said, \u201cEvery year, in December, Kolkata witnesses a pride walk. But no one ever did it in June, which is called the Pride Month. So, we thought why not organise a walk, where people from outside the LGBTQIA+ community can also join in. You never know, this might start a new beginning for all of us,\u201d she said. WALK WITH PRIDE The walk was flagged off from Park Street at 2 pm. As slogans like \u201cAmar shorir amar mon; dur hok shob rajshashon (My body my mind; stop this interference),\u201d filled the air, there were claps, songs and unlimited cheering from the crowd. The sense of unity and pride was palpable. Cars came to a halt and curious passers-by dropped in to see what was going on. And as they learnt about the pride walk, a few joined in, clapping to the rhythm of the slogans. \u201cPeople are becoming more receptive. The pace may be slow, but the society has started understanding that we are just like them. Our sexual orientation or choice of gender does not make us any different. So, we can proudly come out of the closet and talk about our life\u2019s choices,\u201d said Atashi Nath, a participant, who has been living with her girlfriend in Kolkata for the past two years. MY LOVE IS JUST LIKE YOURS As the march reached the Exide crossing, several participants were seen shouting slogans as they held each other\u2019s hands. Among them were Aparna Gharami and Rama Deb. Aparna said they met two years ago via social media. \u201cDuring that time, we had different partners. Rama was subjected to abuse and mental torture by her partner and eventually came out of the relationship. During that time, I also had a breakup. Slowly, we became friends and then took the relationship to the next level,\u201d said Aparna, adding that they are looking for an accommodation and will move in together soon. \u201cInitiatives like these reassure us that we are not alone and give us strength. On the other hand, it educates common people about our community. Probably, these walks are the reason that we are getting courage to come out,\u201d said Rama. EXTEND A HELPING HAND Among the participants, there were those who came from different parts of the country just to root for members of the community. Ritika Maity from Gwalior and Chetna Khullar from Delhi were two such individuals. Chetna, who is not a queer community member, travelled to The City of Joy with her friend. \u201cI was really excited to hear about this initiative and couldn\u2019t help but participate. These walks work as a support system to many people. I am glad to be such a support,\u201d she added. BONDING OVER PHOTOGRAPHY As the march ended at Maidan after three hours, the photographers, who gathered for the walk, took a break and indulged in some adda. Few were seen sharing a laugh over bhanrer cha, while others simply sat on the ground and sang We Shall Overcome. They held hands as they made their voices heard. Pritam Sen, who participated in a pride walk for the first time, told us, \u201cI always wanted to come to a pride walk not just because it is a great subject for photography, but also because I really wanted to experience it. So, I was thrilled when I learnt about this on Facebook. Today, I will be returning home not just with some great shots but also some really good friends,\u201d he added.  Alivia Basu, a photographer and a transman, said the walk was an exercise in bonhomie. \u201cI like street photography because I can shoot without any human interaction. Today, when I was sharing frame and composition ideas with other photographers, I didn\u2019t feel any kind of uneasiness. It didn\u2019t occur to me what they would think or if they were out to judge me. I think this is the biggest takeaway from the walk,\u201d he added.

A former director of IPGMER, Mitra enjoys the confidence of medical students and has been the face of the health establishment for more than a decade. It\u2019s his relentless effort from behind the curtains that contributed to doctors climbing down from their hard stance and laying down conditions to withdraw the ongoing agitation. Mitra was at NRS Hospital within hours of junior doctors launching their agitation last Tuesday. He pacified them, tried to reason with them and get them to agree to talk to the state administration. His efforts didn\u2019t yield any dramatic response from the agitating doctors, but he reportedly kept at it. He kept returning to NRS, the epicentre of the agitation, and was present to lend an ear to the young doctors whenever they aired their grievances. When the committee of five senior doctors comprising, Sukumar Mukherjee, Plaban Mukherjee, Alokendu Ghosh, Makhanlal Saha and Abhijit Chowdhury, went to Nabanna to meet chief minister Mamata Bnerjee last Friday, Mitra stayed back at NRS, sharing the junior doctors\u2019 concerns and listening to them patiently. Liked by students and young doctors alike, Mitra is a veteran in dealing with agitations. He has faced several as the IPGMER director till his seven-and-a-half year stint came to an abrupt end in 2015. Former students recall how he would never lose his cool even amid slogan-shouting. Mitra would, in fact, ask agitating students if they wished to gherao him. \u201cHe would manage to crack jokes with us even as we pressed him with our demands. With him around, you always had the confidence that the administration is sympathetic,\u201d a former student said.

They work under tremendous stress and trying conditions. In crisis, they need to be dealt with patiently and in a friendly manner. That\u2019s what I have always tried,\u201d he said. On Sunday morning, too, the veteran pathologist spent time with the doctors before they convened a governing body meeting at NRS. According to junior doctors present at the meeting, he asked for permission to speak for three-four minutes before the meeting began at 11.30am. Mitra, in his address, called upon doctors to take a step towards solving the impasse, telling them that he realized their demands were reasonable, but the strike was not benefiting anyone and should be ended. He suggested that irrespective of the steps that the government took to protect them, doctors should form their own committee to review the situation at state hospitals. \u201cThey should meet every fortnight and if they are not satisfied, they can go to the principals or the MSVP.

Though no report of death has reached the civic headquarters so far from the borough health offices, the civic top brass is worried over recurrence of the dreaded diseases in areas known as dengue-prone. Sources in the KMC health department said the situation could turn worse in absence of an anti-dengue drive by the KMC and state government at the earliest. A report has been sent to the state health department by the KMC health department signalling a dengue threat looming over large areas under five KMC boroughs and seeking help from the state for a combine drive to prevent a spurt in the cases during the approaching monsoon. TimesViewTaking guard in advance is important. Merely reacting after the problem is already at the doorstep may not help. There needs to be a proper plan of action to preempt an outbreak. And lessons need to be learnt from the past.Some of the areas, which have recorded dengue cases include, Taltata, Elliot Road, Park Circus, Tiljala, Ballygunge, Lake Gardens, Jodhpur Park Alipore, Behala, Tollygunge, Garia, Bijoygarh, Baghajatin, Jadavpur and some areas located off EM Bypass. According to a KMC health department official, many of these areas had seen a spurt in dengue cases last year and several dengue death cases were also reported from some of these areas. \u201cWe are extremely worried over reports of dengue from these areas this year too. What we need is a combined drive by different KMC essential departments and the state government health department must pitch in to help us. Once monsoon sets in, we will be on our toes to prevent spread of dengue from one area to the other,\u201d a senior official in the KMC health department said. The civic health department team combating dengue has expressed its helplessness over the lack of initiative on part of the state in solving issues that might mar dengue prevention drive if not tackled immediately. For example, a KMC health department official pointed out lack of initiative in cleaning garbage from several abandoned private buildings and government properties.

Debasish Mukherjee a RSP councillor who represents areas like Sree Colony, Pallisree, Bangajatin and Vidyasagar Colony close to Ramgarh rued that several government properties like abandoned primary schools had become real breeding grounds for dengue mosquitoes.

Two separate home ministry advisories came on the same day governor Keshari Nath Tripathi wrote to CM Mamata Banerjee a second time, urging her to talk to striking doctors and provide them adequate security. The Bengal CM reacted strongly to the central advisories. \u201cAsk those who sent the advisory to look after the country. Law and order is a state subject. How many people have been killed in Yogi\u2019s Uttar Pradesh or in Gujarat? Let them first send advisories to UP and Gujarat,\u201d she said. The advisory on the doctors\u2019 strike said the MHA had received representations from doctors, healthcare professionals and medical associations from different parts of the country on their \u201csafety and security in view of the ongoing strike by (Bengal\u2019s) doctors\u201d. It then \u201crequested\u201d for a detailed report to be sent \u201curgently on the representations and the ongoing strike by doctors\u201d.

Bengal governor Tripathi\u2019s missive to the CM added to the heat on the Bengal government. Tripathi had tried to get in touch with Banerjee on Friday to discuss how to break the stalemate but the meeting did not occur because the latter was in Bijpur on Friday afternoon. \u201cI have spoken to the governor over the steps the government has taken. He is convinced,\u201d the CM said on Saturday, indicating that the governor was on the same page with her on the issue. Saturday\u2019s is the second home ministry advisory to reach the state government in a week, making it obvious that the Trinamool government in the state is firmly under the BJP-led centre\u2019s scanner. The first advisory came on June 9 and the second repeated the ministry\u2019s \u201cserious concern\u201d over the situation in Bengal, making it clear that the centre was not satisfied with the state chief secretary\u2019s response (it claimed that the \u201csituation was under control\u201d). The home ministry has quoted figures based on reports it has received to substantiate how incidents of political violence have increased in the state over the years. \u201cIncidents of political violence in Bengal increased from 509 in 2016 to 1,035 in 2018. A total of 773 incidents have occurred till date in 2019. The death toll rose from 36 in 2016 to 96 in 2018; 26 deaths have already taken place in 2019,\u201d it stated, adding: \u201cThe continuing trend of political violence from 2016 through 2019, as evident from the above figures, is indicative of the failure on the part of the law enforcement machinery of the state to maintain the rule of law and inspire a sense of security among people. The government of India is seriously concerned about the prevalent situation in West Bengal.\u201d The ministry also sought a report from the state government on the specific steps it had taken to investigate the cases of violence and bring the culprits to book. The centre\u2019s vigilance on Bengal has increased since governor Tripathi called on PM Narendra Modi and union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on June 10 and held that the law-and-order situation in Bengal had room for improvement. Tripathi followed it up with a meeting of four major political parties in the state, including the Trinamool and the BJP, at Raj Bhavan on Thursday and worked out a five-point consensus to contain political violence in the state.

Earlier, the agitators had insisted that chief minister Mamata Banerjee visit the city's NRS Medical College and Hospital, the epicentre of the agitation. After an internal meeting late on Saturday, the doctors, who had turned down an invite for a closed-door meeting with Banerjee at the state secretariat, mellowed down and stated that they were ready to hold a dialogue in any form, but the venue of the meeting would be decided later. \"We will be deciding on our next step during a governing body meeting today. We are open to any dialogue as always. The venue for the meeting will be decided soon,\" a spokesperson of a joint forum of junior doctors told reporters here. During a press conference at the state secretariat on Saturday, Banerjee urged the agitators to resume work and said her government had accepted all of their demands. She also stressed that a group of doctors had met her and expressed their willingness to join duty, a claim vehemently refuted by the striking doctors. During the meet, the chief minister emphasised that her government had not invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) to get the doctors to resume work. \"We have laws, but we do not want to use them.... We are not going to take any stringent action against any of the agitating junior doctors and hamper their career,\" she said after the agitators did not turn up for a meeting at 5pm. The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued an advisory, seeking a report on the ongoing stir and stating that it had received a number of representations from the medical fraternity from different parts of the country for their safety and security in view of the strike in West Bengal. Bengal Governor K N Tripathi has written to Banerjee, advising her to take immediate steps to provide security to the medicos and find out a solution to the impasse. The chief minister said she had spoken to the governor and apprised him of the steps taken by her government to resolve the matter. Doctors across the state called for a strike after two of their colleagues were brutally assaulted at the NRS Medical College and Hospital by the family members of a patient, who died on Monday night. The services continue to remain affected in the emergency wards, outdoor facilities and pathological units of many state-run hospitals and private medical facilities in the state, leaving several patients in the lurch. The Calcutta high court had, on Friday, refused to pass any interim order on the strike by the junior doctors. It had also asked the state government to persuade the doctors to resume work.
