In March, deputy collector, Vivek H P, in his capacity as SDM had first issued a \u201cstop work\u201d order to the builder under section 133 of CrPC to discontinue with \u201cthe hazardous excavation and construction with immediate effect.\u201d A show cause notice pertaining to the restoration of the creek by the builder to its original condition had also been issued. When the matter came up for hearing recently, the SDM called for proper details of the matter, including the extent of the reclamation. He also sought a report from the mamlatdar. Taleigao comunidade had also demanded that the authorities clear the mud in the creek before the monsoon, as the heavily silted water way is prone to flooding during extreme weather events. The construction of a concrete wall on the edge of the reclamation, to fortify the embankment, was also in progress when the notice was issued. Haphazard development on either side of the creek without any setbacks and concretisation of its banks by builders along the water body has already shrunk the width of the creek.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

The town and country planning (TCP) department, which notified the Goa Land Development and Building Construction (Amendment) Regulations, 2019, will also allow third party technical clearance for low-risk buildings such as residential homes. The revised norms, which are effective immediately, are designed to reduce the interaction between the TCP department and applicants, while also helping the state to increase its ease of doing business rankings, said officials. \u201cWe have brought in an enabling provision for online approvals using Auto-DCR. The software itself is being prepared, and will be rolled out soon,\u201d said chief town planner James Mathew. Auto-DCR is a software that automatically studies building plans by reading CAD drawings and checks if they meet TCP\u2019s development rules. TCP minister Vijai Sardesai had announced that the state had floated the tender for the Auto-DCR in September 2017. These draft norms were published in December 2018 for objections and suggestions, which were looked into by a steering committee. After the scrutiny and incorporation of valid suggestions, the government has now moved to notify the regulations. However, what is expected to bring relief to applicants and reduce TCP\u2019s workload is the move to permit registered architects or engineers to issue third party certifications for low-risk buildings for facilitating issuance of technical clearance, development permission, and completion order. \u201cThird party certification by professionals for low-risk buildings such as residential homes with one story in up to 500 sq m area is being permitted for promoting ease of doing business,\u201d Mathew said. He said that the government also wanted to simplify the process to start solar farms in the state by waiving the need for permissions for setting them up. Along with the construction of solar farms, an individual or company will also be allowed to set up up office space of a maximum of 200 sq m, the notification says. TCP has also taken into consideration the impact that malls or commercial complexes have on traffic movement and parking. The new regulations stipulate that a traffic impact study and a traffic management plan have to be in place before clearance is given for malls. Malls or entertainment complexes will be permitted in commercial zones and only next to 15m-wide roads. The norms also state that adequate parking should be available in such malls.

To many, it may seem that the 19-year-old is exploring his culinary skills, but Ritesh (full name withheld) is trying to give the term higher education a new meaning. With his parents out and nearly a dozen friends in his house, the teenager is mixing bricks of hashish with brownies to bake hash-brownies or pot-brownies. From villages to urban areas, from corridors of schools to hostels of professional colleges, drugs are available easily in Goa and it is these schoolchildren and students who have become prey to substance abuse. Under pressure to look \u2018kewl\u2019, more and more Goan students, especially in hostels, are consuming drugs in their food. While there is no statistical evidence to this, anecdotal experience suggests that hash-laced brownies are being innocuously passed around in school corridors and outside the campus. With fewer glaze-eyed youths having needle marks, parents are none the wiser about the intoxicating substance lurking inside what looks like a harmless piece of cake. \u201cSmoking a joint relaxes me, I began to take it due to exam stress,\u201d said Ryan D (full name withheld). Ryan has since dropped out of medical school and is seeking assistance to kick the habit. If one knows the right people, hash, cocaine, heroin, LSD, ecstasy and meth is easily available for the right price. \u201cCannabis (smoking up) is the most common method, the gateway drug. It leads to consumption of other substances, as users pursue greater highs,\u201d said Ravindra Agrawal, a psychiatrist who runs counselling clinics in Panaji, Vasco and Margao. Most drugs make its way to Goa by train and through the state\u2019s porous borders and is sourced from Mumbai, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Gokarna in Karnataka, and the Andhra Pradesh-Odhisa border districts. The \u2018stuff\u2019 is then sold at internet cafes, money exchange shops, shacks or by friends. Marijuana comes a lot cheap as compared to other intoxicating substances and youth embrace it owing to its association with \u2018creativity\u2019 and \u2018off-beat\u2019 mood, said a law student from Goa. \u201cUnless there is complete breakdown of parental supervision, this usually happens from 9th class onwards, as the child starts becoming increasingly independent,\u201d said Agrawal. \u201cThe risk is highest in hostels of professional colleges, where parental supervision is the least. The most important risk factors irrespective of what the situation of the child is peer pressure. The need to \u2018fit-in\u2019 is a great motivator,\u201d he said. Hashish, also known as hash or charas, is sourced from the female cannabis plant, from where marijuana (ganja) also comes from. However, while dry flowering buds and even leaves of the cannabis plant are ground and used to \u201csmoke-up\u201d a joint of weed, to produce hashish one has to separate the resin from the flower and then crush the resin to release the oils. A recent global mental health study conducted by one of the experts in the field, Vikram Patel, found that schoolgoing children used drugs and other substances including tobacco, cannabis and alcohol to cope with stress. Agarwal said besides cannabis, he has come across cocaine and heroin addicts, too. Ecstasy, meth and LSD, while popular in the party going circuit, are not common among students and adolescents. A psychiatrist from North Goa, who specialises in addiction research, said students often tell him during awareness sessions in colleges and higher secondary schools that cannabis is easily available even in Goan villages. \u201cThis puts paid to the commonly held belief that access to drugs is restricted to the beach belt and only to western tourists,\u201d the psychiatrist said. ANC will take care of it: CMChief minister Pramod Sawant, who also holds the home portfolio, said the anti-narcotic cell (ANC) of Goa police was tackling the drug menace very effectively. \u201cAt present, ANC is doing very good work. I have taken a review and will be meeting them regularly to tighten it further. They will take care of the whole state\u2026 schools, educational institutions and others,\u201d Sawant told TOI.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

With Campal swimming pool shut for refurbishment for the Games, almost 50 swimmers from the state are left in the lurch as they don\u2019t have the required infrastructure to train.  Though they moved to the Peddem sports complex at Mapusa to train, a national-level swimmer said they dread at the thought of entering the murky waters of the pool.  \u201cThe quality of the water has deteriorated. When objections were made public, authorities attempted to clean, but unfortunately the pool has gone back to its old ways. There is hardly any visibility while swimming and I honestly fear that I may hurt myself,\u201d said a top swimmer.  Having spent crores of rupees in developing infrastructure, the state government has been unable to provide swimmers with basic training facility.  \u201cI will not want myself or any other of the young swimmers to get hurt (by training at Peddem).

How will we perform at the Nationals if we don\u2019t know our timings? My parents told me I was going wayward.\u201d  But Arolkar also agreed that there was an issue with visibility.  \u201cIt is because of backwash. Due to heavy usage, a lot of dirt and waste gets collected. The plant treats it and 90% is filtered out. What remains, takes eight days to clean up. This issue is prevalent during the summer,\u201d he said.  On swimmers getting rashes and infection, Arolkar said, \u201cNot a single swimmer has come to me and shown the medical report. I have 450 swimmers including Navy personnel who train here. It is just a (small) set of people who are complaining.\u201d  The swimming pool at the Peddem sports complex was constructed in the early nineties, while the complex was renovated in 2013 ahead of the Lusofonia Games.  \u201cThere is a need for a new swimming pool here.

But those in Safdarjung Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College, RML Hospital and others will skip work. In Kolkata on Sunday, the agitating doctors said they were ready to meet Mamata Banerjee \"anytime and anywhere\". The government proposed a 3pm meeting at the state secretariat on Monday. The doctors were reportedly ready to accept the proposal.

The state government, however, cited legalities and constitutional propriety, which prevent such meetings from being held under public glare. The doctors were ready to accept the government's request, sources indicated late Sunday, which would pave the way for \"across-the-table\" discussions between the protesters and the chief minister. \"We are very hopeful for the meeting in Nabanna (state secretariat) on Monday,\" a senior official, mediating for the state, said. \"We have explained to them that given the issues involved, mainly legal, administrative and security-related, it is impossible for the state government to agree to their demand for an open-door meeting in presence of the media. The CM is also sworn to an oath of secrecy in some such matters. We have explained they have every right to speak to media afterwards, much like the norm in all such cases. They have agreed to it,\" he said. Under pressure from several quarters, including the seniors in the medical fraternity, the junior doctors in Kolkata held a four-hour general body meeting at NRS Hospital. The meeting appeared to split three ways. While a section of doctors agreed to have the meeting at Nabanna, another section stressed on Raj Bhavan as the venue, while the remaining stuck to their demand for NRS Hospital. Pressure further mounted on the striking doctors to find a solution to the standoff. At 3.30pm, a group of doctors announced their stand. \"We are hopeful that our CM will be considerate enough to solve the problems that the state is facing in the healthcare sector currently,\" they said in a statement while refusing to accept any question from the media. \"We leave the decision to choose the venue to the honourable CM, but it should accommodate representatives of all medical colleges of West Bengal in sufficient numbers,\" the statement read.

The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\".

On swimmers getting rashes and infection, Arolkar said, \u201cNot a single swimmer has come to me and shown the medical report. I have 450 swimmers including Navy personnel who train here. It is just a (small) set of people who are complaining.\u201d The swimming pool at the Peddem sports complex was constructed in the early nineties, while the complex was renovated in 2013 ahead of the Lusofonia Games. \u201cThere is a need for a new swimming pool here. The diving structure is dangerous and we have put up a board not to use it. With latest digital filtration technology available, we must upgrade,\u201d said an official, who asked not to be named.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Two members of the family\u2014father and son\u2014were killed and four seriously injured. Outraged by the incident, a 250-strong mob set the outstation vehicle on fire, demanding justice for the victims and blocked the bridge for four hours. Police said the incident occurred at 6.45am when the family was travelling in a car driven by Judas Fernandes, 25, with his father Joao Fernandes, 62, mother Milagrin Fernandes, 53, sister Cynthia Fernandes, 29, and friends Sonia Lobo, 22, and Alton Simoes, 24, from Morjim to attend Mass at St Anthony Church in Siolim. The accident took place in the middle of the Siolim-Chopdem bridge, about a kilometre from the celebrations at the Siolim church. The Maharashtra registered sports utility vehicle (SUV) with five occupants travelling from Calangute to Ashwem collided head-on with the car. The impact was such that the son was killed on the spot while the father died on the way to the North Goa district hospital where he was declared brough dead by doctors. Locals alleged the group from Maharashtra was under the influence of alcohol and driving in the wrong lane when they hit the Fernandes family. Milagrin and Alton were shifted to the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC). Police said their condition was serious till Sunday evening. Cynthia and Sonia are being treated at the North Goa district hospital at Peddem, Mapusa. The incident outraged locals who rushed to the site and blocked the road demanding action against the SUV occupants who fled the scene after the accident. The bridge which connects Siolim to Pernem taluka remained closed for four hours, paralysing traffic. Judas\u2019 body was lying alongside the bridge for four hours as locals refused to allow authorities to move it. They demanded that the culprits be given stringent punishment for their rash driving. The ill-fated vehicle was towed away at 11.15am. An hour after the accident, the situation escalated as 250-300 locals gathered at the site. The mob set the SUV on fire, demanding the culprits be arrested and brought to the site. A fire brigade was pressed into service to douse the car in flames. A huge contingent of police force, including superintendent of police North Goa Chandan Chowdhury, dySP Gurudas Gawade, Anjuna PI Navlesh Dessai, Mapusa PI Kapil Naik, Pernem PI Harish Madkaikar and PSI\u2019s from various police stations, officials from the mamlatdar office and the traffic police were present at the site to pacify the locals.

We have booked an offence under Sections 337 (Causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 304 (Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 279 (Rash and negligent driving ) of the Indian Penal Code against SUV driver Shekhar Dubey. Preliminary investigations suggest the occupants of the SUV are staff of a hospital in Mumbai,\u201d Dessai told TOI. All the occupants statements were recorded.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19.
