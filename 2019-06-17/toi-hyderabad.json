The statement mentioned that National Green Tribunal, Delhi, in its judgment on February 19 empowered the Central Pollution Control Board to levy environmental compensation on polluting industries. It warned all concerned industries \u201cto take immediate remedial measures\u201d in this regard. As per Section 20 of the NGT Act, 2010, while passing any order, decision or award, the NGT has to apply three core principles, including the \u201cprinciples of sustainable development, precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle\u201d. The Polluter Pays Principle is important for determining cost of damage from violations, which have not been standardised. While placing liability on polluting units and individuals, it is also key to fostering sustainable practices.

The NGT\u2019s judgment provides for a delegation of power for implementation of such orders.\u201d Experts suggest that though determining exact penalty amount is not possible, some definitive quantitative determination must be made. Penalties should be sufficient to deter industries from causing pollution, which is not the case currently.

Thousands of families are deserting the villages. Hundreds of deep borewells have gone completely dry leaving no water to be tapped. According to unofficial reports, at least 24 villages in Yerragondapalem, Kanigiri, Giddalur and Markapuram constituencies have been deserted. This is the fourth consecutive year that Prakasam district is witnessing a severe drought. The rural water supply department (RWS), transporting water to the crisis-hit villages, has been struggling to meet the ever-increasing demand for water. Prakasam district singularly is taking up nearly 10,000 trips of water tanks each day of the 22,000 trips being supplied by the water supply department for the entire state. Sources said that RWS officials supplied over 7,500 trips per day to the area in April and upped the scale of supplies to 9,400 by May. They thought that the situation might ease down by June. However, it was not to be. The attempts of the RWS to revive the borewells have also gone in vain as water could not be tapped even at the depth of 1,000ft. Sources in the RWS say that they would not be able to continue the supply by tankers for long. \u201cIn fact, it has become very difficult to supply 1,000 trips per day to each assembly constituency,\u201d said a senior RWS official. \u201cLeaving the village is the only way to survive now,\u201d said Pedda Venkateswarlu of Karumanupalle village of Tarlubadu mandal.

K Sudharshan Reddy, the complainant, submitted that he had purchased Maruti Alto 800 in July 2014. He said within six months of purchase, he noticed several problems in the car, including noise from the engine, broken lock level on the right-hand side rear door, faulty horn and a crack on the front side windshield. He submitted that he immediately rushed to the showroom and then to authorised service center to get these problems rectified, but instead of replacing the old horn with a new one, they tried to repair the defective piece. Reddy claimed that next day, while going to work, he could still hear the noise from the engine and the horn was not functioning. He further claimed that due to the faulty horn, he was forced to drive slow and it resulted in an accident. He said that because of slow driving the vehicle was consuming more petrol and also he had to leave early for work and was reaching home late. Claiming that Maruti Suzuki and Varun Motors failed to rectify the problems despite multiple complaints, he filed this complaint in the consumer forum seeking compensation. The representatives of Maruti, in their written version, submitted that Sudharshan Reddy did not lodge any complaint with regard to non-working of the horn, but only stated that the horn was defective. They said that they had adjusted the horn and delivered it on the same day as the horn was working after adjustment. They claimed that the complainant\u2019s allegation that an accident took place due to non-working of the horn is false.

The amalgam that apposed diametrically divergent and distinguishing styles was enthralling, to say the least.  the group started with Vande Mataram fused with Sare Jahan Se Achha, keeping in mind the Independene Day fervour. Sahaj Ma\u2019s deep voice and Godkhindi\u2019s classical vistar resounded in the auditorium. A peek into each performer\u2019s individual streams left listeners spellbound.

The jugalbandi between Pt.Shubhankar Banerjee on tabla and Gino Banks on drums left the audience craving for more. Pravin Godkhindi, who is the only Indian to play the world\u2019s largest flute, the contrabass, captivated the audience with his euphonious flute renditions. Sahaj Ma and Utpal Faqir transported the audience to rural Bengal with the song, Chander gaye chaand legeche, amra jene korbo ki, by a Bengali Baul saint, Lalon Fakir.  The musicians followed each other on stage, improvising to suit each other\u2019s style, yet, not letting their individualistic style get lost in the blend. As the musicians traversed through intricate patterns to attain a crescendo, the auditorium thundered with undying applause.  Sahaj Ma and Utpal Faqir broke into a slow dance in the midst of their performances. Sagar Paul could not stop himself rocking to and fro with the rhythm throughout the concert. Even George Brooks swayed his hips from time to time enjoying the performance. They all looked like a bunch of buddies who sat together to jam, unmindful of the 500 awestruck eyes watching them.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Residents in areas such as Gachibowli and Financial District are grappling with meeting their basic water needs for months owing to dipping groundwater table and poor water supply. \u201cGroundwater situation in the area is critical,\u201d said Chandra Reddy, district water department in-charge for Ranga Reddy on Friday. The groundwater department measures water levels according to mandals. Both Gachibowli and Financial District are categorised under the Serlingampally mandal. The department\u2019s report for the 2018-2019 up to May shows that the current average in Serlingampally is 13.79 metres below ground level (mbgl) from 10.85mbgl last year. While groundwater level reduced by 2.94mbgl on paper, what is more frightening is that the department does not have historical records of specific areas such as Gachibowli or Nalagandla. Chandra Reddy said, \u201cThe actual levels could be as poor as 25mbgl to 30mbgl. This is because the rocky landscape does not allow water to permeate. Also poor rains and mindless concretization are to blame.\u201d \u201cFor measuring the groundwater, one needs to have separate borewells dug. These areas have rocky terrain and do not easily allow for such deep borewells,\u201d said Chandra Reddy, adding that required infrastructure will be created under the Phase 2 of World Bank project. Rainfall is the principal source of input for groundwater recharge. In Ranga Reddy district, under which Serlingampally falls, 487.9mm rainfall was recorded against the normal rainfall of 692.8mm during 2018-2019 (up to May). This is 29.6 per cent less than the normal. Sources in the Hyderabad Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) said that the problem is due to lack of rains and consequent drying up of Manjeera and Singur water sources.

The bond between MS Dhoni and Karachi-born Mohammad Bashir aka \u2018Chacha Chicago\u2019 blossomed during the 2011 World Cup semifinal between India and Pakistan and it has only grown stronger since. Such is the bond that Bashir has flown into Manchester from Chicago (approximately 6000 km) for today\u2019s high-octane Indo-Pak contest without a match ticket.  He knows that Dhoni will ensure that he is it at the Old Trafford when the first ball is bowled. \u201cI arrived here yesterday and saw that people are ready to pay as much as \u00a3800-900 (approximately Rs 70,000 to 80, 000) for a ticket. A return ticket from Chicago costs the same. Thanks to Dhoni, I don\u2019t have to struggle for a match ticket,\u201d said the 63-year-old, who owns a restaurant in Chicago and is an American passport holder. The connection between Chacha and MSD goes back to 2011. Bashir was bowled over by Dhoni\u2019s benevolence when the India\u2019s World Cup-winning captain went out of his way to arrange a ticket for him for the marquee clash in Mohali, a showdown for which most fans would pay an arm and a leg to watch in person. Eight years later, the heartwarming story of Bashir and Dhoni continues.  It is not a surprise anymore that Bashir supports Dhoni\u2019s team over the country of his birth whenever the two sides clash. Dhoni might not be easily accessible for even his teammates at times but has never disappointed Bashir. \u201cI don\u2019t call him as he is so busy. I keep in touch only through text messages. Long before I came here, Dhoni assured me of the ticket. He is a great human being. I can\u2019t think of anyone else doing what he has done for me since that 2011 game in Mohali. Imagine, I get the ticket for free when most would pay a fortune for it. I have got a surprise gift for him this time and I hope to give it to him later today,\u201d said Bashir. \u2018I am alive only for cricket\u2019 His love for his homeland is understandable but the reason for his affinity towards India is his Hyderabadi wife, besides Dhoni of course. His match-day uniform has both India and Pakistan colours and Bashir calls himself an \u2018ambassador of peace\u2019. While watching Indo-Pak games all-around the world, Bashir has made lifelong Indian friends and one them is the well-known superfan Sudhir Kumar Chaudhary. In fact, both are staying together in Manchester. \u201cSudhir abhi apni body pe Tricolour paint karwane gaya hain. I book the room and we stay together. Thanks to Allah, I am doing okay (financially) and that is the least I can do for a friend. I just gifted Sudhir a phone and it made him really happy. These are the little things in life that give you happiness,\u201d he said.

This is the first time that the health department has planned to control dengue by employing \u2018breeding checkers\u2019. A total of 325 specialized professionals will be deployed across 13 districts where the case load of dengue has been particularly high last year. Although, so far, anti-larvae and mosquito control activities were dealt with by municipal corporations, the new measure has been planned as both dengue and chikungunya saw an exponential rise in 2018. Dengue cases went up to 6,362 in 2018 as compared to 3,827 in 2017, while chuikungunya cases went up to 1,063 in 2018 from 58 in 2017.

The breeding checkers must have passed Class 10 and will be recruited at a salary of Rs 10,000 per month for a period of five months and will be given training before deployment. Payments will be made with National health Mission (NHM) funds. Their role in the vector borne disease control includes working in tandem with the primary health centres, conducting pyrethrum space spray and fogging operations, conducting focal spray, ensuring timely submission of daily reports on status of anti-larvae activities, submitting monthly reports and having a mandate to cover 100 houses per day (600 in a week) for anti-larval operations.

Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

Activists opposing translocation say that only 25% of trees survive the process. Captian J Rama Rao, an environmentalist, says, \u201cTranslocation is mostly done in an unscientific manner without proper follow-up. Trees with shallow roots can be moved, but those deep-rooted need adequate space and follow-up, which never happens.\u201d A campaign to \u2018Save the banyans of Chevella\u2019 has seen many resident groups oppose translocation.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination. His late grandfather, Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, was long associated with the Congress. | Full coverage of Lok Sabha elections in MaharashtraAmong other prominent leaders from Maharashtra in the first list of candidates are Union minister Nitin Gadkari from his hometown Nagpur, state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve from Jalna, Union MoS Hansraj Ahir from Chandrapur and Union MoS for defence Subash Bhamre from Dhule.

However, in a move that may bring some relief to patients in New Delhi, AIIMS resident doctors have decided not to join the strike. But those in Safdarjung Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College, RML Hospital and others will skip work. In Kolkata on Sunday, the agitating doctors said they were ready to meet Mamata Banerjee \"anytime and anywhere\". The government proposed a 3pm meeting at the state secretariat on Monday. The doctors were reportedly ready to accept the proposal. IMA strike to cripple OPDs todayEarlier, the junior doctors had insisted that the meeting cannot be held behind closed doors and the media should be allowed to telecast it live. The state government, however, cited legalities and constitutional propriety, which prevent such meetings from being held under public glare. The doctors were ready to accept the government's request, sources indicated late Sunday, which would pave the way for \"across-the-table\" discussions between the protesters and the chief minister. \"We are very hopeful for the meeting in Nabanna (state secretariat) on Monday,\" a senior official, mediating for the state, said. \"We have explained to them that given the issues involved, mainly legal, administrative and security-related, it is impossible for the state government to agree to their demand for an open-door meeting in presence of the media. The CM is also sworn to an oath of secrecy in some such matters. We have explained they have every right to speak to media afterwards, much like the norm in all such cases. They have agreed to it,\" he said. Under pressure from several quarters, including the seniors in the medical fraternity, the junior doctors in Kolkata held a four-hour general body meeting at NRS Hospital. The meeting appeared to split three ways. While a section of doctors agreed to have the meeting at Nabanna, another section stressed on Raj Bhavan as the venue, while the remaining stuck to their demand for NRS Hospital. Pressure further mounted on the striking doctors to find a solution to the standoff. At 3.30pm, a group of doctors announced their stand. \"We are hopeful that our CM will be considerate enough to solve the problems that the state is facing in the healthcare sector currently,\" they said in a statement while refusing to accept any question from the media. \"We leave the decision to choose the venue to the honourable CM, but it should accommodate representatives of all medical colleges of West Bengal in sufficient numbers,\" the statement read.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The decision comes at a time when the chief minister is under attack by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for not attending the Niti Aayog meeting held in Delhi. Ahead of the first Parliament session on Monday, the Union government has invited all presidents of political parties with representation in the Parliament, including the chief ministers of the two Telugu states KCR and YS Jaganmohan Reddy and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu with the aim of deliberating on five agendas of their choice, with PM Modi taking the lead. However, officials said that KCR, who has scheduled several meetings in the coming days, including a TRS executive party meeting on June 19, the day Modi is holding the meeting in Delhi, may miss the chance to meet him for the second time within a span of five days. While the letters have been received by KCR, Jaganmohan and Naidu, KCR is unlikely to attend the meeting. \u201cHe is busy with Kaleshwaram project, so he could not attend the Niti Aayog meeting,\u201d a party source said. However, an official from the chief minister\u2019s office added that he was not aware of the letter from Delhi. In the letter written by parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi, party presidents were chosen to address the meeting on any one of the five identified agendas of their choice. Ministers and party leaders will deliberate on ways to improve the productivity of the Parliament, \u2018One Nation, One Election\u2019 policy, developing new India after 75 years of Independence, programmes to be taken up to mark Gandhi Jayanti and development of emerging districts at the Parliamentary Library Building. Union ministers will also invite suggestions from party leaders on decisions to be taken by state governments to help in the country\u2019s development. Moreover, Naidu will most likely skip the meet in view of the tension between the TDP and Modi. \u201cWe have only six MPs in Parliament, given the scenario, our chief may not go,\u201d a TDP leader told TOI.

Reason: No clarity yet whether he is an Indian or a Pakistan national. India\u2019s efforts to deport Keshwani came to a nought after Pakistan refused to accept him as its citizen. In January 2004, Keshwani alias Saleem Keshwani alias Akbar Ali was arrested by the Sadar police in Agra along with one Sameer under Section 3 of the Passport Act and Section 14 of the Foreigners Act. When Keshwani was in judicial remand in Agra prison, Task Force police of Hyderabad had arrested one Mallik Arshad Mahemood alias Arshad Mahemood alias Arshad Mallik, a Pakistani national, from an Internet cafe at Agarwal Chambers, Koti, on March 8, 2004. Subsequently, police raided Mallik\u2019s rented accommodation at Mutyal Bagh, Abids, and recovered evidence suggesting that he was carrying out espionage activities by gathering information about defence establishments in Secunderabad. On interrogation, Mallik allegedly confessed that he got Rs 30,000 from Mumbai-based hawala operator Keshwani in August 2003. Based on his confession, police named Keshwani as accused number 2 in the case and charged him under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act, Sections 3 and 9 of the Official Secrets Act and IPC Sections 120-B, 419, 420, 468, 471. When Keshwani\u2019s term at the Agra prison was nearing completion in 2013, SIT sleuths had brought him to Hyderabad on transit warrant and lodged him at the Cherlapally prison. Keshwani plealded not guilty to all the charges levelled against him and, after the trial, on March 9, 2015, a local court had acquitted him. While acquitting him, the court had observed that \u201cthe prosecution has not produced any evidence to show that Keshwani is a Pakistani national. At the same time, Keshwani has not produced any evidence to show that he is an Indian and not a foreign national\u201d. The court had observed that prosecution also failed to provide any evidence to show that Keshwani has provided money to convicted accused Mallik and his confession alone was not sufficient to prove Keshwani\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy. After the acquittal, Telangana prison authorities, through the state government, had made several attempts to initiate proceedings to deport Keshwani to Pakistan. \u201cBut, Pakistan authorities refused to accept Keshwani as their citizen. Keshwani claims to be from Mumbai, but he does not have any family member or any document to support his claims. As a result, he continues to remain in detention at Cherlapally prison through a state government order,\u201d a Cherlapally prison official said. The 70-year-old is lodged in a separate cell. Director-general, Prisons, V K Singh said cases like Keshwani\u2019s take some time to reach a logical conclusion. \u201cIt takes some time to deport foreign prisoners as the procedure involves communication between multiple agencies.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli. In Video:No Murli Manohar Joshi in BJP list of 43Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}}
