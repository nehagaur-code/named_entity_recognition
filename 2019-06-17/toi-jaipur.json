You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The Pratap Nagar police investigating the attack on RTO flying squad by mafia men in Jagatpura on Saturday have revealed that the main accused Giriraj Yadav ensured that his barji-laden trucks arrive in the city from Sawai Madhopur and Tonk without any hassle from cops or the mining department. \u201cIt is shocking that Yadav\u2019s truck travelled from Sawai Madhopur to Jaipur, stopped to pay toll and yet nobody checked what was being supplied in his heavy dumper vehicles,\u201d said an official The police said that Yadav is a former truck driver who delivered goods across the state and earned a meagre amount Rs 5,000. His luck changed overnight after he began smuggling sand from Tonk and Sawai Madhopur to Jaipur. \u201cUnlike in his previous stint as a truck driver, the accused claimed he could now earn a direct profit of Rs 35,000 in supplying illegally mined bajri across posh areas of the city like Vaishali Nagar, Malviya Nagar, Mansarover etc,\u201d said an official. Arrested on Saturday late night, the accused said he had struck a rapport with villagers in Datwas in Tonk and Bonli in Sawai Madhopur district. \u201cHe used to buy bajri for Rs 15,000 per dumper from villagers. He sold it in the city for a double amount thereby multiplying profits,\u201d said the official. Yadav became so rich in mere six months that he purchased four more dumper trucks to smuggle bajri. \u201cHe set up a warehouse in his Kanota located house where bajri was kept for delivery. He also asked his brother-in-law Kalu to join the illegal trade,\u201d the official told TOI.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

But those in Safdarjung Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College, RML Hospital and others will skip work.

The state government, however, cited legalities and constitutional propriety, which prevent such meetings from being held under public glare.

The CM is also sworn to an oath of secrecy in some such matters. We have explained they have every right to speak to media afterwards, much like the norm in all such cases. They have agreed to it,\" he said. Under pressure from several quarters, including the seniors in the medical fraternity, the junior doctors in Kolkata held a four-hour general body meeting at NRS Hospital. The meeting appeared to split three ways. While a section of doctors agreed to have the meeting at Nabanna, another section stressed on Raj Bhavan as the venue, while the remaining stuck to their demand for NRS Hospital. Pressure further mounted on the striking doctors to find a solution to the standoff. At 3.30pm, a group of doctors announced their stand. \"We are hopeful that our CM will be considerate enough to solve the problems that the state is facing in the healthcare sector currently,\" they said in a statement while refusing to accept any question from the media. \"We leave the decision to choose the venue to the honourable CM, but it should accommodate representatives of all medical colleges of West Bengal in sufficient numbers,\" the statement read.

With the continuous decrease in the number of judges, the pending cases have increased up to 4 lakh till April 2019. Former judges of the HC termed it an \u201calarming situation\u201d and urged on the need of filling the vacant posts for the early disposal of cases. Presently, the HC has 24 judges, including the chief justice, which is below 50% of the total sanctioned posts. Former judges said that this is the reason why the petitioners get justice very late in cases related to education, services, recruitment etc. Four years ago, the HC had 40 judges when the sanctioned posts were increased to 50. Since then, there has been retirements and also elevation of some of the judges from Rajasthan as chief justice in other states. \u201cIt is an alarming situation that number of judges is less than 50% of the total sanctioned posts. Thus, the pendency of cases is increasing with each passing day. I believe it is must to fill up these vacancies as early as possible. If the HC collegium had sent some names out of which not everyone was selected by the collegium of the Supreme Court, action should be taken towards resending the names,\u201d said Justice V S Dave while talking to TOI on Saturday. The situation is that even after the retirement of two HC judges, including Justice K S Ahluwalia and Justice Banwar Lal Sharma in May, the number of judges has remained only 24. Besides, there are few more judges who are on the verge of retirement in the next couple of months. \u201cThere is of course a need to fill up posts in next couple of months.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The chief minister's request to the Centre comes against the backdrop of Rajasthan MP Gajendra Singh Shekhawat being made a cabinet minister in the newly-formed jal shakti ministry. Gehlot had gone to Delhi to attend the fifth governing council meeting of the Niti Aayog. Gehlot asked the minister to support the state's loan-waiver scheme to help farmers of Rajasthan recover from the indebtedness. He said, the state further planned to waive off crop loans pertaining to nationalised, commercial and rural regional banks up to Rs 2 lakh per farmer. \u201cAs these financial institutions are under the control of the finance ministry, the centre should help the state in having a one-time settlement with the banks for the loan-waiver,\u201d said Gehlot. He also urged the minister to give nod to the proposal to extend external financial aid to Phase III of Rajiv Gandhi Lift Canal Project costing Rs 1,450 crore. This project would provide drinking water to 2014 villages and five towns of Jodhpur, Barmer and Pali districts till 2051. Gehlot further requested the finance minister to ensure timely release of funds of the centrally-sponsored schemes and emphasized the need for reverting to the past practice, when the state's share in the central taxes were released on the first day of the month. \"This practice had been changed in the past few years leading to the states facing financial issues. The states have to make payments towards salaries and pension on the first day of the month, which becomes very difficult,\" said Gehlot. The CM also told Sitharaman that Rajasthan had several drinking water projects proposed with the help of Japanese aid agency JICA. \"These proposals are pending with union ministries of drinking water and sanitation and urban development,\" he said. Gehlot said that to ensure no dearth of funds for various development projects, states should be allowed to take loans up to 4% instead of 3% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing an all-party meeting on the eve of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, invited heads of all parties to a meeting on June 19 to discuss the \"one nation, one election\" issue and other important matters. Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

The climate change alone is not responsible for desertification Pushkar which is located in the midst of serene Aravalli hills. Human intervention is also to be largely blamed for it.

Reepunjaya Singh, professor of urban planning, Rajasthan Institute of Public Administration (RIPA) said, \u201cIt is unfortunate that the holy city has been treated like an upcoming urban city.

A young debater, Saumya Singh, marked his name on the top spot in CLAT 2019. Unlike the recent trends in opting for environment, cyber, corporate or intellectual property rights, Singh\u2019s area of interest lies in the Constitution and spreading legal awareness. \u201cThe Constitution is sacrosanct. Every Indian should be taught the basics of the Constitution and the laws for creating a healthy and growing democracy,\u201d Singh, a native of Udaipur, said. A student of DPS in Udaipur, he feels that an independent judiciary is essential for the fair functioning of all constitutional bodies or democracy would cease to exist. He recently cleared his Class XII (humanities) by scoring 95.2 per cent. \u201cI chose humanities to sharpen my knowledge and understanding of social sciences which is required not only to crack the CLAT exam but also to understand the complex concepts of law,\u201d he said. He prepared for the exam from a local coaching institute in Jaipur. \u201cI have been attending coaching on weekends and on vacations for the last two years,\u201d he said. His obvious choice is to pursue law at NLU, Bangalore. He plans to sharpen his judicial activism and feels there is need for reforms in the judiciary, especially in the appointment of judges. \u201cLike the media, legal eagles are also a strong pillar of democracy. I am of the view that law practitioners should make the best use of tools like public interest litigation (PIL) and work with the public to create legal awareness,\u201d Singh said. He loves to follow media reports covering high profile cases related to scams, crimes and corruption, etc. \u201cI make sure I read case studies listed under the Constitution bench in the Supreme Court,\u201d he said. Rajasthan has had unprecedented success in the CLAT exam. Rajat Maloo and Aman Garg secured first ranks in CLAT in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

The decision comes after the issuance of show-cause notices to two BDOs (block development officers) and JTAs (junior technical assistants) at Dausa block (panchayat samiti), for manipulation in the entries of deployment of labourers in the groups. \"We have issued a directive to all 33 districts to improve their wage rates, quality of work-site management and quality of engineering work. We have also asked them to engage more female mates. We have observed that they do better work. They are more sincere and honest. The standing instruction is already there to engage at least 50% female mates (mates are those who manage work at the sites/take roll calls in prescribed muster rolls). We have also instructed them to train the mates in groups,\" Kishan told TOI. \"While this order has been there for years, it has been not been executed properly.

Not only are wildlife conservationists concerned about the issue but the state forest and wildlife officials have written to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) requesting the agency to review the relocation programme. ST-16 was the fourth male tiger, brought to the reserve to repopulate it, to die in STR in less than two years. Arindam Tomar, chief wildlife warden, Rajasthan, told TOI, \u201cI have written to NTCA to review the tiger relocation programme and to identify the problem areas as well as find viable solutions since the plan has not been as successful as in Panna National Park in Madhya Pradesh. In 10 years, we were supposed to relocate 20 tigers, but only nine have been relocated till now.\u201d The request was written as part of the standard report which is sent to NTCA following the death of the tiger by the concerned department. The Panna National Park was the second reserve in the country after STR which had lost all tigers to poaching. Now, it has almost three times the number of tigers in comparison to Sariska, which has 16 of the big cats. 5 tigers could survive at STR The death of ST-16, which according to post-mortem report was due to severe heatstroke and a tumour on its leg, has sent major shock waves as the tiger was transferred from Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR) only in April. The seven-year-old tiger was the son of tigress Sundari (T-17), which disappeared in 2013. He was essentially shifted from RTR to STR to balance the male-female tiger ratio in the latter which has more female population. After the death of three male tigers previously, ST-16 was relocated to STR but did not survive even for two months. In the last 11 years, a total of nine tigers, including ST-16 or T-75 as it was previously known, have been relocated from RTR to STR, but only five have managed to survive. ST-1 (male), which was relocated in 2008, died due to poisoning in 2010, while another male tiger, ST-4, which was relocated in 2010, died in a territorial fight in 2018. In the same year, a female tiger, ST-5, who was relocated in 2010, was killed by poachers. Male tiger ST-11 was a cub born in STR but its death last year had increased the urgency of relocating ST-16.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The decision came during a state level working committee meet held in Jaipur on Sunday. \u201cCongress government has taken a decision of delimiting panchayats which will be opposed tooth and nail. They have taken the decision on their own without following the rules,\u201d said Madan Lal Saini, state president of BJP. Sharpening his attack, Saini said that government\u2019s priorities are not in sync with people and they have lost confidence of the people. \u201cGovernment has no control over crime in the state. The number of rape cases are on an all-time high, the sand mafia has no fear of the law.

Taking a dig at the changes made in the revised textbooks, Saini said that Congress party has axed the role models of BJP which is condemnable. \u201cIt is very unfortunate that government is acting with vengeance. They are not adopting the polices and schemes made by the central government. They have closed down Bhamashah Yojana, not implementing Ayushman Bharat Yojana, contractors are not getting their dues, employees their salaries and people are waiting for electricity. They have failed to show any governance in the state,\u201d said Saini.

Congress has not taken a lead even in the assembly segments won by CM Ashok Gehlot and deputy CM Sachin Pilot. It shows that they have lost their mandate,\u201d said Raje.

For the remaining facilities like office, garage, a fund of Rs27 lakh has been sanctioned. Abha Beniwal, deputy commissioner fire at JMC said, \u201cAround eight fire-fighting bikes and two tenders will be available here. The bikes will be more, as due to the congested lanes, heavy vehicles will not be useful. We are expecting that within three months the station will start functioning.\u201d The congested lanes of Walled City have always been a headache for the administration during the time of any fire incident. The fire tenders are not able to get into the narrow lanes and there have been incidents when the fire brigade has to break walls to make space for the water pipe to reach at the spot. Around five new fire tenders have been bought by the DLB to be included in the fire brigade of the city. Fire department already has 50 fire tenders at present and more are included to improve the fire security of the city. For the first time in the state, a 70-metre fire tender will be included and will cost Rs14 crore to the JMC.

We have done a number of private events in Jaipur earlier. The weather is simply amazing during this time of the year. We performed to a lovely crowd of music aficionados (old and young). Our challenge was to make sure that we keep people of all ages entertained and hooked. Thus, we made our set list accordingly. Overall, it was a great experience being in Jaipur,\" he shares. With a chock-a-block schedule, the members of the band did not get enough time to explore Jaipur. Sanam says, \"We reached in the daytime and straightaway headed for the sound check. Then, we got back, worked on our set list, got ready and left for the show. After the show, we did manage to eat some delicious Rajasthani food. The food was little on the spicy side but that did not stop us from gorging on the delectable food served to us. I love Jaipur ka khana.\" Venkat S, the bass guitarist, quips, \"I love laal maans. I think it is something to die for; it\u2019s heaven on the plate.\" Keshav Dhanraj, the drummer says, \"I think we come to Jaipur mostly just to eat. Every time we come here, we are occupied with sound check and our show. So the only thing that we do is to gorge on Jaipur\u2019s food and enjoy the weather.\"  To which Sanam jokingly adds, \"This is so true. We are big-time foodies. Agar humein khaane ke liye paise milte to hum sab kitne rich hote.\" Venkat says that the next time when they come to the city, they would love to move around like any other tourist and see the rich heritage that the city boasts of.  On Friday, the band came up with their new song, Sanam Mennu. Sharing the idea behind the song, Venky S, says that the song has been composed keeping Valentine's Day in mind. He adds, \"It's our first release this year and is our original composition. It's a light-hearted song about something most people go through while in a relationship. Since, we are four boys, the song is obviously from a boy's perspective. This is our Valentine's Day special song and we hope that everyone will relate to the lyrics and tune of this song.\"  (L-R) Venky S, Samar Puri, Sanam Puri and Keshav Dhanraj , members of Sanam bandThe band, Sanam, is known for its renditions of retro classics apart from their original compositions. We ask them if there are any factors that they take into consideration when they choose a retro song. To which Keshav replies that there are no factors as such. However, whichever old classic they decide to revamp, they make sure to not change the soul and melody of the song. \"We grew up listening to some beautifully composed and well-written songs, an art that seems to have lost its way these days. Most of the newer music we hear today lacks the soul and complex compositions that we enjoyed listening to. As a band, we decided to make our own renditions of these amazing songs so that the newer generations can get a chance to listen to some well written and composed creations. Our renditions also connect with the older audiences because they get to hear their favourite songs presented to them in a new light. We give it our own sound and flavour, but the soul of the song remains intact.\"  Opening up on creative differences within the members of the band, vocalist Sanam says, \"Each of us has different musical background and enjoys listening to different styles of music. The fact that we have different ideas and creative processes, helps keep our sound unique. We respect each other\u2019s ideas and make sure that we only release a song once all of us are completely satisfied with it. Also, we work on things together so we are always open to trying different options before settling on anything.\"  Sanam band during their performance Talking about Rajasthani folk music, Keshav shares, \"We find Rajasthani folk music interesting. There are so many unique instruments like the khartal, ravanahatha, alghoza, sarangi etc. that are used. We have a playlist on our Youtube channel only for regional music. So far, we have not attempted a Rajasthani song. But we hope to collaborate with some musicians and singers from Rajasthan to make some interesting renditions of the state's folk music.

Monsoon is expected to cover the entire state by July 1. Authorities said that increase in humidity, which has gone up to 75% from 18%, is also a good sign that makes things conducive for the onset of south west monsoon. Rajasthan in the past had witnessed monsoon rainfall on June 17 and June 20 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and IMD said that the state can expect onset of monsoon by last week of June. By July first week, south west monsoon is likely to be widespread when state capital Jaipur can also expect the monsoon showers.

A report by Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI) reveals that the spurt in economic activities in the desert districts has shattered the fragile landscape, impacting its residents directly. CAZRI shared the report to mark the World Day to Combat Desertification on June 17. This was compiled using multiple independent studies including the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite data 2015-16. The report made the astonishing claim that 14.88-million-hectare land in 12 western Rajasthan districts suffered from different kinds of land degradation contributing to desertification. The report has studied the features of desertification: wind erosion / deposition, water erosion, salinity/ alkalinity, waterlogging and vegetation degradation to conclude that the situation may take decades to reverse the damage. The report studied districts of Barmer, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Churu, Ganganagar, Hanumangarh, Jodhpur, Jalore, Jhunjhunu, Nagaur, Pali and Sikar. \u201cThe biggest reason contributing to desertification turned out to be water erosion. Our report suggested that 64.69% mapped area is facing wind erosion. For instance, 10% of land degradation in districts like Barmer, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur is due to water erosion,\u201d said O P Yadav, director, CAZRI. Explaining the reason why the sandy landscape existing from millions of years is facing the change only in the last few decades, the report explained that such landscapes are highly vulnerable to wind erosion and it is a universal phenomenon. \u201cWhat made the situation worse is human-induced activities like fast urbanization, deforestation, mining, indiscriminate use of groundwater, rise in livestock population and the hot summers leading to evaporation. This has accelerated desertification,\u201d said Yadav. Supporting their claim, the scientist says that western Rajasthan harbours a total domestic livestock population of nearly 30.18 million heads \u2013 an increase of 14.63 million heads (94.72%) over the 1956 Census figures. \u201cThe destruction of vegetative cover due to overgrazing, felling of trees, etc. have accelerated the removal of sediments from the catchment areas of waterbodies as well as loosening of farm soil,\u201d said Yadav. Large-scale mining has been mapped in Jhunjhunu, Jalore, Jodhpur, Barmer for the minerals and building materials, which has impacted the equilibrium. The vegetation cover has gone forever, making the land vulnerable. The report added that the overall scenario has affected the agricultural productivity to a great extent. The introduction of water intensive and multiple crops have their adverse effects in the region. \u201cThe empirical data is still being collected to give exact mass land converted into desert,\u201d said Yadav. The team of scientists are also accessing the damage being caused due to increasing vehicular traffic, construction of roads and canal and exploration of oil and gas.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.

TimesViewAfter a brief lull, Rajasthan is once again slipping into the grip of \u2018mafia raj\u2019, the likes of which are usually seen in Bollywood movies. The state\u2019s mining mafia, especially the one ruling the illegal \u2018bajri\u2019 trade, has become so brazen that even top police officials are publicly expressing their helplessness in checking it. After mowing down a senior citizen recently who opposed the mafia\u2019s activities, they have now attacked government officers in Jaipur. What\u2019s more worrying is the utter lack of commitment shown by the state\u2019s top leadership in curbing the menace and establishing the rule of law.Sources in Rajasthan police told TOI that over 1,000 criminals, mostly in their early 20s \u2014 which include history-sheeters, village strongmen or local louts \u2014 have joined the bajri smuggling syndicate for quick money. On Saturday morning, when a RTO team in Jagatpura was attacked by about eight to ten m afia men, the unidentified accused were found to be mostly between the age group of 20 to 25 years. According to sources, criminals have found a new recourse in bajri smuggling after running out of luck and profits, in a cut-throat trade of illegal liquor smuggling. \u201cMany of these criminals were earlier involved in illegal liquor smuggling cases, transporting consignments from Haryana where liquor is cheap, to Gujarat where it is prohibited. They already knew the tricks of the smuggling trade and therefore, when demand for bajri shot up in the state, they immediately jumped ships,\u201d an official told TOI. Both liquor and bajri smuggling share same modus operandi that include private cars escorting dumper trucks, informers at highway eateries and tea shacks relaying information on the movements of flying squads and highway patrols. \u201cThe police special branches (SBs) and Criminal Intelligence Units (CIUs) posted in multiples cities over the past few years, had managed to penetrate deep into the liquor dens operating across the state. Therefore, the risk of defectors and gang rivalry posed a big worry for syndicate\u2019s underlings. The minions then decided to turn to bajri mafia where gang rivalry is minimum, the trade is decentralised and moreover, the risk of arrest in stringent sections is low, while profits are quick,\u201d the official added. A highly placed source involved in probing the death of Kishore Singh (60) who was mowed down by mining mafia in Kardhani on Wednesday for opposing illegal transportation, such is the lure of easy money that people from varied backgrounds including milkmen and truck drivers have joined the illegal trade. \u201cThe main accused currently on the run in Singh\u2019s death case is a former milkman who used to supply sand, but decided to transport bajri to reap windfalls,\u201d said the official, adding that many former genuine bajri truck drivers have more or less lost their livelihoods and replaced by goons. Additional DGP (Crime) BL Soni said that mafia is not a right term to assign to bajri mining. \u201cThere are many villages located alongside rivers where people are extricating bajri. Anyone with means in these belts is involved in the trade,\u201d he said.

The protesters smashed earthen pots in front of the PHED offices to register their anger for the failure of the department to manage water supply. Addressing a protest organized by the party at the Jal Bhawan in the Civil Lines area, former minister Arun Chaturvedi alleged that even in the distribution of water, the ruling party is differentiating on political grounds. He said, statement of some of the ministers claiming that there is no water crisis as people have not come to the streets is an insult to the people reeling under severe water shortage. In a memorandum to the chief minister, Chaturvedi demanded strict action against the black marketing of water tankers, installing new tube wells, immediate launch of the Rs 11.5 crore drinking water project sanctioned by the previous BJP government at Gujjar ki Thadi among others Another protest was held at Sanganer led by party MLA Ashok Lahoty. Lahoty in his memorandum to the chief minister said the major residential areas of Mansarowar, Pratap Nagar and Prithviraj Nagar falls under the assembly segment of Sanganer. Besides Sanganer is also world famous for its dyeing and printing works which is also a major source of livelihood. He pointed out that Bisalpur water is supplied to major part of Jaipur city from Balawala water distribution centre near Sanganer, but major part of Sanganer assembly constituency is left out of Bisalpur water. He demanded connecting areas under Sanganer with Bisalpur water supply scheme. He also alleged large scale corruption in the distribution of water by water tankers aggravating water crisis. The Kishanpole unit of the party proposed to organize protest over erratic and irregular water supply in the area on Saturday. Meanwhile Rajasthan PCC spokesperson and transport minister Pratap Singh Kachariyawas alleged that the BJP is shedding crocodile tears on water as it had done nothing in the last five years to improve water supply. He said the state government had dug 532 boring wells in Jaipur in the last four months and 200 more are in the pipeline to improve water supply.
