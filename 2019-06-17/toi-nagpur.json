This is almost at par with what a graduate from the premier Indian Institute of Management (IIM)-Nagpur gets. With 100% placement, the average salary package for all 43 NFSC students was around Rs10 lakh, said college officials. The BE (Fire) course was restarted at the college in 2015 after decade\u2019s gap with the new four-year pattern that adhered to AICTE guidelines and had JEE marks as the admission criteria with Std XII as minimum education. The earlier course, started in 1978, was of 3.5 years and had BSc as the minimum eligibility criteria. GS Saini, director of NFSC, said, \u201cMajor oil companies are the employers and it\u2019s a great start for these fresh graduates. It\u2019s a matter of pride that all students from our first batch have got excellent job offers.\u201d He added that their campus boasts of state-of-the-art labs, training equipment, faculty and hands-on experience. \u201cIn the world there are just two colleges where you can do this BE (Fire) course, which is recognized by all authorities. One is in London and the other is in Nagpur,\u201d said Saini. The director said that admissions for the 2019-20 academic session closes on June 20.Senior city academician Sanjay Charalwar says that it is good to see such graduates getting good job offers. \u201cWhen these children joined about four years ago, even they would not have known that such high pay package will be offered to them. In the more common courses like MBA etc, the principle of demand-supply kicks in.

Hotels in Nagpur recently conducted fire safety awareness among its members. The hoteliers say there is a big demand for trained professionals in this sector. Tejinder Singh Renu, president of Nagpur Residential Hotels Association (NRHA), said, \u201cAcross cities there is growing awareness about fire safety and in turn demand for trained professionals. As of now there is a huge gap between the two, so companies will have to pay a premium for human resources.\u201d Renu added that this sector will always be \u201chuman intensive\u201d. \u201cMachines can raise an alarm but can\u2019t decide how to fight which kind of fire.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh.

As cremation falls under essential and sensitive services, the NMC should ensure sufficient quantity of briquette round-the-clock. In case of no stock of briquette, the civic body is supposed to provide firewood free of cost. Firewood is provided free of cost at other crematoria in the city. As per information available from activists and corporators, employees of NMC Laxmi Nagar Zone and activists had three months ago informed the NMC health department about no supply of briquette from the contractor. The crematorium then had stock for only one-and-a-half months but the department did nothing. Chairman of NMC projects consultative committee Sanjay Bangale told TOI this is sheer negligence on part of NMC officials. \u201cWhatever may be the technical problems, there should be no excuses for non-supply of briquette.

Ganesh Tandulkar, an autorickshaw stand coordinator at Jhansi Rani Chowk, was allegedly hacked to death by a gang of fellow drivers on Saturday. The assailants were apparently enraged that he shielded a man they wanted to eliminate. The incident took place at Udibaba Chowk in MIDC. The MIDC police acted quickly in the Tandulkar murder case, arresting three assailants, Abhijeet Singh, Rakesh Kuryavanshi and Vicky Dabekar. Within hours, 22-year-old Gaurav Nagpure was stabbed to death by his rivals near a community toilet at Gangabai Ghat within the jurisdiction of Kotwali police station. Nagpure was attacked by his neighbours-turned-foe Tejas Bagde, Shoaeb Malik, Bobby Malik and others with sharp weapons over old rivalry. The injured Nagpure was rushed to hospital, where he was declared dead. Later in the evening, city and rural police set off on another chase when news of a murderous assault on gangster Viju Mohod started doing the rounds. Sources in the police said Mohod, who had kidnapped gangster Maroti Nuwa around two months ago, was apparently kidnapped from an eatery by close aides of another gangster, and thrashed up very badly. Staffers from Beltarodi, Nandanvan, and Sakkardara police stations of city, and Kuhi in rural, started a frenetic search to track down more information. Mohod had a dispute with another goon, identified as Amit Bilge, some days back, which was settled at marriage of one Bobby. Despite this, Mohod had been attacked by his rivals, and was in critical condition at hospital when reports last came in. The mastermind of the gang that attacked Mohod had been arrested by Pachpaoli police in an offence registered in 2017. In the same offence, the gangster had been freed even after being nabbed by crime branch, due to alleged political influence and support of a builder. In the Tandulkar murder, police said the assailants wanted to eliminate one Dinesh Pandey, also an autorickshaw driver, to teach him a lesson for confronting them earlier in the day. The three assailants are trying to establish their dominance at the autorickshaw stand, and Pandey had abused Singh in a lighter vein earlier in the day. It\u2019s learnt that Tandulkar, whose cousin is posted at crime branch, too had a wordy duel with Vicky earlier in the day. Later, Pandey and Singh, who were once classmates, exchanged abuse at the autorickshaw stand at Rani Jhansi Chowk. They were separated by Tandulkar before he left to attend a family programme at Timki. In Tandulkar\u2019s absence, Dabekar assaulted Pandey with a sword on his right shoulder. Pandey went to a hospital at Hingna and informed Tandulkar and another autorickshaw driver Chandrakant Bhagwat. Tandulkar and Bhagwat rushed to the hospital, picked up Pandey and dropped him home safely. Some time later, Tandulkar got a call on his cell phone from Kuryavanshi, who summoned him to Udibaba Chowk. Kuryavanshi and Dabekar wanted Tandulkar to call Pandey too at the spot. Tandulkar reached the spot but kept pleading with the assailants to forgive Pandey and forget the incident. As Kuryavanshi and Dabekar started getting aggressive, Tandulkar tried to sneak away in Bhagwat\u2019s autorickshaw. But Kuryavanshi and Dabekar attacked Tandulkar, and while Singh thrashed Tandulkar, Dabekar assaulted him with a sword. MIDC police have registered an offence of murder against four persons, including the three already in custody.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The state government, however, cited legalities and constitutional propriety, which prevent such meetings from being held under public glare.

Pressure further mounted on the striking doctors to find a solution to the standoff. At 3.30pm, a group of doctors announced their stand. \"We are hopeful that our CM will be considerate enough to solve the problems that the state is facing in the healthcare sector currently,\" they said in a statement while refusing to accept any question from the media. \"We leave the decision to choose the venue to the honourable CM, but it should accommodate representatives of all medical colleges of West Bengal in sufficient numbers,\" the statement read.

The play dates back to 1947 when people began to see the sun of freedom approaching, but the cost and consequences of it were still unknown. The decision of the British Raj to divide India shattered the lives of many, causing the biggest migration ever happened in history. The drama revolves around Baandish, the central character of the play, who is a Sikh living in undivided India (which is now in Pakistan) and his struggle while migrating from his land, leaving behind his memories, childhood, dreams, and his mother. The actors effectively portrayed the pain and sufferings of the people with throbbing performances and top notch acting. The play offered a glimpse into undivided India by showcasing brotherhood among Hindu-Muslims, love for each other\u2019s traditions, lifestyle and religious beliefs. The decision to divide the country pitted these two communities against each other. The Punjabi attire of characters, old household set-up, precision of dialogues and quality of expression made the play a treat to the eyes of spectators. The concluding part of the play which showcased the dark side of partition, resulting into mass deaths, poverty, unhygienic conditions and emotional baggage of leaving behind their homes, touched the audience.

The king had a weird habit of punishing criminals. If someone is caught in the crime, he would ask the accused to recreate the scene in a period of seven days. If the accused repeats it, then he/she would be handed out punishment depending on the nature of crime that was perpetrated. Legend has it that after the king\u2019s death, his painting started giving punishment. Interestingly, this would happen to those who buys it. The drama starts with highly egoistic Shyam, proud of his intelligence, dominates his wife Meera as she is not able to match him. As Shyam owns the painting, the rule applies to him, of facing punishment for a crime. With Shyam going hammer and tongs, a person named Manasvi comes in the picture who tells him about the legend and that today is the seventh day since he bought the painting. However, Shyam refuses to believe Manasvi and asks him to leave. He keeps arguing with his wife over trivial issues. This, according to legend, is also a crime in the eyes of the painting. Manasvi tells him that this is the last chance to mend ways it being the seventh day. But Shyam gives two hoots to his advise that the painting would punish him for the crime and beats up Meera. Not able to differentiate between the legend and the present in which he is living, Shyam becomes a lunatic and runs away from the house. The moral of the story, according to Manasvi, is that \u2018What we sow is what we reap.\u201d Actors Nachiket Mhaisalkar (Shyam), Himani Ballal (Meera) and Gaurav Khone (Manasvi) gave stellar performances. The drama was directed well by Nachiket. The second drama, \u2018Rang Bhulaiyya\u2019, is about three college friends Abhi, Ashwini and Sameer. Sameer\u2019s mother is suffering from cancer when Ashwini is about to be promoted as a senior software in-charge for a new project. When Sameer comes to know about it, he approaches Ashwini and tells her that he can\u2019t afford his mother\u2019s treatment. Sameer says he would get promotion if she turns it down so that he could get extra money and be able to give his mother good medical treatment.

She contributed Rs51,000 from the benefits she got from the department to ensure a room was erected for women colleagues. A rest room for women cops at the police station struck Hemlata as one of the biggest requirements, to ensure they have a place for a breather in between strenuous working schedule at odd hours. Hemlata had worked the night shift continuously for five years, to ensure her only son Dhruv\u2019s upbringing was not affected, as her husband Deepak worked at a central government office in regular office hours. In fact, it was Deepak\u2019s transfer to Gujarat that prompted Hemlata to quit and follow him there. \u201cI worked in the night and looked after my son in the day time when my husband was at office. One of us had to sacrifice for our son\u2019s sake. We could compromise on everything but not on the son\u2019s upbringing,\u201d she said. \u201cAt times, I used to look around the police station in the wee hours of the day, trying to find a corner to just lay down for a while out of exhaustion,\u201d she said, \u201cSometimes even a woman complainant would land up at odd hours with children in tow, and have nowhere to go.\u201d \u201cI hope my contribution will help my women colleagues rest and also change in case they get drenched in rain or something,\u201d she said. Hemlata\u2019s send-off also had a different hue as it was held, upon her insistence, at the Government Observation Home for children at Patankar Chowk on June 14, and not at the police station as usual. Hemlata\u2019s gifted clothes to the underprivileged inmates, and complete sets of books and stationary to two students of standards X and IX. Hemlata\u2019s decision lit up the lives of the inmates of the government home for one day, as Jaripatka police too turned it into an \u2018Eid milan\u2019, distributing \u2018Sheer kurma\u2019 to all. Hemlata, who joined the police department 21 years and six months ago, has always celebrated special moments at places like old age homes and orphanages, whether birthdays or anniversaries. \u201cIt brings special happiness if shared with people who need love and care more than others,\u201d said Hemlata. Helping children too is nothing new too for Hemlata, something she had been doing as a cop too. \u201cI had taken several abandoned and unattended children to safe shelters. Once I rushed a newly-born baby to orphanage after spotting him at a dumping site at Mominpura. The baby survived, and I still have his picture in my mobile phone, and keep seeing it from time to time,\u201d said the woman cop, who now intends to be a housewife at least for the foreseeable future.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Noting that there are many new faces in this Lok Sabha, PM Modi said the first session of the lower house of Parliament should begin with \"fresh zeal and new thinking\". At the all-party meeting, the Congress raised with the government issues of unemployment, farmers distress, drought, and press freedom, while also calling for early conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition parties demanded discussion on all such issues in Parliament, with the Congress asserting that it is still a \"fight of ideologies\". Prime Minister Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress lawmakers Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, K Suresh, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O'Brien were present at the meeting. The BJP also held its parliamentary party meet on Sunday with Prime Minister Modi assuring Indians that his government will be at the forefront of facilitating legislation that manifests the spirit of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas\". A day before the first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha, a meeting of the NDA was also held here. The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. The first two days of the session will be used for administering oath of office to all Lok Sabha MPs. The oath will be administered by protem Speaker Virender Kumar. The Speaker will be elected on June 19 and the next day the President will address a joint sitting of both Houses. The budget will be introduced on July 5. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could be a contentious one between the government and the opposition. Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the Prime Minister urged leaders of all parties to \"introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted\". An all-party meeting is a customary procedure before the beginning of every session of Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning. Joshi said the government has requested all parties, especially the opposition, for their cooperation for the smooth functioning of both Houses of Parliament. In order to build esprit de corps, PM Modi has invited presidents of all those parties who have an MP either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for a meeting on June 19. The meeting has been called to discuss \"one nation, one election\" issue, celebrations of 75 years of India's Independence in 2022 and 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary this year, he said. It will be followed by a dinner meeting with all MPs of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 20 to freely interact and exchange views with the government, Joshi said, adding that these two novel initiatives would go a long way in building team spirit among all parliamentarians.

To ensure absolute health and hygiene, dental care is utterly necessary. Dentistry is one of the most desirable professions today. This profession deals with inspection and treatment of teeth, gums and other parts of the oral cavity. In carrying out treatment and surgeries, dentists get assistance from a number of people like dental hygienists, dental assistants, dental therapists and dental technicians. All of them collectively offer oral healthcare facilities and services. Dental health is an essential part of the overall health system. With modern lifestyle, dental problems are becoming common among all sections of society. This career profile is changing rapidly, creating many opportunities and challenges for job seekers. With increasing awareness about oral health and introduction of new fields like oral pathology, periodontics and orthodontics have enhanced the scope in this field. This career offers high wages and flexible work schedule. You also get the opportunity to be your own boss if you choose to start your own practice. Furthermore, this profession also to carry out computer and magnetic resonance imaging, implants, tissue grafts, trauma and laser surgery. Gagandeep Lamba, associate professor in the department of pediatric dentistry, said there are quite a few options for students after they complete their degree in Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS). She said, \u201cDentistry professionals can join any private hospital or clinic to work as a general dentist. Research in a pharmaceutical firm and working with armed forces are other great options. Dentists can go for post-graduation after their BDS by pursuing Masters in Dental Surgery (MDS).\u201d Dentists in India have great job opportunities in nursing homes, hospitals, clinics and healthcare divisions of the government. They can be professors, lecturers, and associate professors in dental colleges. In addition, they can work as researchers in the pharmaceutical industry and other sectors manufacturing oral hygiene products and drugs such as mouthwash, toothpaste, and gum care products. BDS student Harshita Kumar said, \u201cEvery field is competitive and saturated. It depends on how well you educate yourself and practice in the years you undergo training. Gaining experience by joining dentistry internships and education programmes based on your specialization helps one go a long way.\u201d Patience, concentration, accuracy and ability to stand for long hours are the basic qualities required for this career. If you have an eye for detail, manual dexterity, strong interpersonal and communication skills, then this is an ideal career option for you. The shifting paradigm of dentistry is evidently showing the predominance of women. Dentistry allows women flexibility with hours, office setup and administrative involvement. Many women tend to juggle more workload between their careers, families, homes, and communities. This field does not have emergencies except for accident cases. The duty hours are fixed so that women can work at different hours suitable for them. Also, even if you decide not to go for specialization after the BDS degree, you can establish yourself as a general dentist. It is better to join the course with a clear-cut idea about what your career options are after BDS. The multiple job options include those of a researcher, lecturer, Short Service Commissioned Officer in defense services etc. There are a few emerging specializations in the fields like forensic odontology, cosmetic surgery, laser and aesthetic dentistry. Building a successful dental practice takes hard work and dedication. Be it dentistry or any other profession, the field is bound to be competitive. You have to be on your toes always and ready to face challenges thrown your way. Hundreds and thousands of students pass every year. Government and private jobs cannot accommodate this ever-increasing number of graduates. The one who stands tall is ought to come out with flying colours.

They said government or commissioner\u2019s approval was not required since these posts were not regular. \u201cThe requirement keeps changing every year. Hence government approval is exempted as per a GR,\u201d they said. This is the second year when the NU would be hiring teachers on contractual basis. Last year too, the NU\u2019s move had attracted allegations of malpractices and violation of UGC norms. Though several objections were raised, the top brass went ahead with the appointments. On May 20, in its Board of Deans (BoD) meeting, presided over by pro-VC Pramod Yeole, the university decided to hire 107 teachers on 11-month contract where they would be paid remuneration of Rs24,000/month. The number has gone up by 15 compared to 92 last year. The teachers would work at 40 NU departments and conducted colleges, including Laxminarayan Institute of Technology (LIT), Sheshrao Wankhede BEd College and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Law College.

Despite this, the appointment of 92 teachers last year was delayed by about six months. The actual teaching started from November end and the tenure concluded on April 30. NU officials said that the university was paying the teachers\u2019 salaries from its general funds. Last year, management council members RG Bhoyar and Nitin Kongre had strongly opposed the move citing several shortcomings. They had said they were not against the filling up of 92 posts but only wanted the NU to reconsider its own norms which were in violation of UGC guidelines.

At Buldhana, the westernmost district of Vidarbha region, dry spells are now not new, and have only worsened by the year. As the drought is at its peak in 2019, a trip across 300km, covering scores of villages, revealed a district gradually heading towards a socio-economic crisis of a new type. Seven years of deficient rains have quietly aggravated migration in the district as profits from farms have shrunk, and also reduced jobs for farm hands. This has gone unnoticed among the powers that be. Officials brush off the migration as normal seasonal movement towards the cities. A cross section of locals TOI contacted in three talukas of the district say recurring droughts are forcing many to even quit farming and work as cheap labour, living in sub-human conditions in cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, and even Surat and Vadodara in Gujarat. Even earlier, people had been moving to the cities from Buldhana to return during sowing seasons. But the numbers have gone up substantially in last 2-3 years only because the series of droughts have made life tough back in the district, say locals. The Indian meteorological department (IMD) website marks Buldhana and other parts of Vidarbha as large deficient area for the year. What began with the landless workers leaving has now ended with even small and marginal farmers leaving their homes and hearth, abandoning their fields. At Isoli village, over 45km from Khamgaon tehsil, its dark and a group of villagers are waiting to a catch a transport till the bus stop 15km away. They are all heading for Pune, some had already settled there and were going back after a short visit. Sanjay Warkad finally decided to leave the village three months ago, and wants to work as a security guard in a housing colony. Warkad, who had come to take his family, including aged parents along, leaves behind a four acre farm. \u201cWith barely any rains and wild animals damaging the crop, its meaningless to stay here anymore. What I earn by farming in a year may be I\u2019ll get in a few months as a guard. With so much construction activity there are many jobs in Pune,\u201d he said. Warkad is not alone. According to Panchayat Samiti members almost 500 acre have been abandoned in Isoli and around as people have left the village. Close by, the Dhavale family is in mourning. A week ago, 23-year-old Maruti Dhavale was murdered in Pune, where he had been working for the last two years. \u201cWe keep getting news of people getting killed in accidents in Pune or Mumbai,\u201d said Amol Pakhare, a local leader. \u201cIt\u2019s not that there was no migration in Buldhana when times were good, but certainly the trend has gone up substantially and repeated droughts are the factor,\u201d added Pakhare, a BJP worker. There is a mini-Buldhana in localities like Balewadi at Pune. There are similar localities in Surat, and Vadodara. \u201cMuslims prefer going to Surat or Vadodara, and the Hindus head towards Mumbai or Pune. This is purely because they join their friends already settled there. Many butchers who have shifted to Mumbai are doing the same work there,\u201d said Mobin Shaikh, deputy sarpanch at Isoli. \u201cLife is bad as they live in cramped rooms in the slums, sharing space with anti-social elements. Dhavale\u2019s murder following a brawl depicts the conditions,\u201d said Samadhan Supekar. \u201cThe migrations are a direct impact of agriculture taking a hit. The big farmers have scaled down their operations due to lack of water. This has cut the demand for farm hands too. Now, even small and marginal farmer, who would supplement their income by working as farm labourers have preferred to leave,\u201d said Vallabh Deshmukh, a director of Maharashtra Seeds Corporation at Amdapur, 15km from Isoli. The Brahmanwada reservoir near the village last filled up in 2006. Since then, the water has only depleted to finally dry up now, and the village is depending on tankers, he said. At Ganeshpur, further towards Khamgaon, Devidas Thatekwar says usually workers who used to leave to harvest sugar cane in West Maharashtra have not returned. In last three years, there has been a major outflow, said Devidas Thatewar. Each village TOI went to had seen at least 20-30 people leaving this year. The story is no different even more than 70km away at Chicholi village in Shegaon taluka. \u201cFarm wages have shrunk to Rs60 a day, so workers can get slightly better wages in a big city, which is prompting many to go,\u201d said Gopal Dhage in Chicholi village. Earlier, when there was no drought, members of the Matang community, who make a living by picking scrap, used to go to Mumbai. As life became tough for farmers in last four years, others also sought references from the Matangs to work in Mumbai, said Dhage. NO OFFICIAL RECORD OF MIGRATIONS A senior official in the district collector\u2019s office said no agency has reported drought related migrations, and said even locals have not pointed out such development. The district administration is already employing over 10,600 persons in more than 1,200 works. It\u2019s ready to employ another 2.5 lakh workers on the basis of requisitions from gram panchayats, said a source. Works under the chief minister\u2019s Jalyukta Shivar scheme were also taken up during the last few years; at 330 villages in 2015-16, 194 villages in 2016-17, and 205 in 2018-19. However, due to lack of rains, there was little scope for water harvesting, said a source. Collector Dr Nirupama Dange could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. RAIN FIGURES TELL THEIR OWN TALE According to data recorded in state government\u2019s maharain.gov.in portal, since 2000, Buldhana has received rainfall below the normal mark in 11 years. The worse has been 2018, when the rainfall was 44% below the normal 668mm. Even after considering five years of excess rainfall, when it poured in the range of 845 to 946mm, the average since 2000 comes below the normal level by 3%. The average of the 11 years when it rained less is 19% below the normal level. This just a per cent less than the large deficit definition of IMD.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Questions have been raised over NU\u2019s move since none of the stakeholders was informed about it even as the new academic year is set to start in a couple of weeks. While concerns have been raised over damage a hurriedly prepared syllabus may leave on NU\u2019s engineering education, this year\u2019s aspirants would be at a loss of not knowing the entire four-year syllabus. Last week, the proposal was tabled before the Board of Studies (BoS) to clear the move when one of the members reflagged it and demanded an elaborate deliberation. So far, only the first-year syllabus has been formulated. Mahendra Chaudhary, who is a BoS Applied Science and Humanities as well as Senate member, was shocked to know about the proposal. He refused to sign the proposal until the BoS allowed discussion on the new syllabus. \u201cI wrote to the vice chancellor expressing my concerns. We need to think about students from the region. The AICTE curriculum is meant for IIT-level students while our colleges have 45 percenters enrolled with them. Ideally, there should be been discussion spread over months. But, now at least faculty members need to be informed through some initiative,\u201d Chaudhary said. On his demand, the NU has agreed to organize workshops, which too has been alleged as a futile exercise. \u201cThe discussion is on the proposed syllabus which means the already decided one would be implemented. Only a handful of engineering faculty members were invited to formulate this new syllabus which is not in accordance with AICTE norms,\u201d some teachers told TOI. The discussions to be held at different colleges from Monday have been dubbed as eyewash since it would deliberate on the syllabus for just over two hours. As per the workshop schedule, the discussion would taken up after lunch between 2.30pm and 4.30pm. Those opposed to NU\u2019s abrupt move wanted involvement of all stakeholders since the start. Stakeholders involve parents, students\u2019 representatives, industry professionals, academicians apart from university officials and members. Surprisingly, the NU has kept the entire affair under wraps as it never bothered to invite suggestions and objections from stakeholders in the last one and half years. The AICTE had introduced the model curriculum in January 2018. The NU also never uploaded a single document or meeting notice on its website about the move. University\u2019s Vice chancellor SP Kane didn\u2019t respond to TOI\u2019s calls and SMS. The new curriculum envisages more weightage to region specific and skill-based learning. Over 60 credits too have been cut to encourage industry internships.

This too is subject to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) clearing the Kamptee Road stretch within a few days. MahaMetro has to construct a double decker flyover from Gaddigodam to Automotive Square. The starting point of the flyover is a bone of contention with the locals opposing the initial location. MahaMetro decided to shift it to LIC Square but NHAI has put a rider that it needs 5.5 metre wide service road. The Metro agency will have to demolish four multi-storied buildings for this. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari has been approached to sort out the issue. The agency does not agree that it is a delay. \u201cAs per the detailed project report (DPR), the project is to be completed in five years from the date of beginning of construction. Work on the project began on May 31, 2015. So we have time till June, 2020,\u201d said a spokesperson. As on date, only one out of the four reaches is operational, that too not fully. Only five out of 11 stations are operating on Sitabuldi-Khapri stretch (Reach I). Only six trains each are plying in both directions on this route. According to MahaMetro spokesperson, frequency of trains on Reach I will increase this month. \u201cWe successfully tested the down line of Reach I on June 4. Now, trains will run on both up and down lines. Moreover, 15 more coaches are slated to reach Nagpur this month. We will be able to run more trains gradually,\u201d he said. As for remaining six stations of Reach I \u2014 Congress Nagar, Rahate Colony, Ajni Square, Jaiprakash Nagar, Chhatrapati Nagar and Ujjwal Nagar \u2014 all of them will be operational by the year end. This will be a gradual process, he added. MahaMetro is supposed to launch a common mobility card for Metro, city buses, feeder vehicles, autorickshaws etc. However, so far the card \u2014 Mahacard \u2014 has been launched with limited features, for travelling in Nagpur Metro only. It has been distributed among commuters. As the Mahacard is EMV (Europay, Mastercard and Visa) based bank card it has to pass through extensive internal testing, third party audit and security review. \u201cMahaMetro is in touch with State Bank of India (SBI) and as per the current planning and discussions, the card is expected to be launched within a month or so,\u201d said the spokesperson. The feeder services are yet to start fully. The operator for the service of bicycles, e-bicycles and e-scooters is Wicked Ride Adventure Services (Bounce). The service has been started on monthly subscription basis. The e-scooter service will start after getting permission from the state transport department. Feeder buses have been started by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) for some stations. According to the spokesperson, hundreds of people working in Mihan live in Besa-Beltarodi. \u201cNMC runs buses from Besa to Airport South and then from Khapri to Mihan. City bus and Metro timetables have been displayed on company notice boards,\u201d he said. There are very few amenities at the Metro stations. The spokesperson said that tenders for small business spaces at Airport, Khapri and Jaiprakash Nagar stations have been floated and necessary services would be available after the process was completed. Khapri and New Airport stations lack approach roads. According to the spokesperson approach road to them is available at Mihan end but these are not tarred roads and in very bad shape. \u201cApproach road to New Airport station from Wardha Road side will be ready in a couple of months,\u201d he added. Next in the pipeline is commercial operation of Reach III. Work on the entire stretch will be over by July end and trains will start plying in August. Here too only five stations will operate initially \u2014 Lokmanya Nagar, Subhash Nagar, Institution of Engineers, Rani Jhansi Square and Sitabuldi Interchange. The remaining stations will be opened up one after another in six to seven months. Reach II (Sitabuldi to Automotive Square) and Reach IV (Sitabuldi to Prajapati Nagar) will be completed in the first quarter of 2020. Work on Reach II is 50% complete, piling work 96%, pile cap 85%, pier 76%, segment casting 33% and Metro station work 54%. Girder launching is progressing. Work on Reach IV is also 50% complete. According to MahaMetro the viaduct is 67% complete, pilling 97%, pile cap 95%, pier 76%, segment casting 78% and segment erection 63% has been completed. Contractors were supposed to finish the work by December 2019. However, this is not happening. On whether they will be penalized, the spokesperson said, \u201cEntire Reach II is stuck up due to NHAI.

He is the third minister from the district after the CM and energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule. He has been allocated the public works, tribal development and forest portfolios. Although Fuke will be a minister only till October, when assembly elections are scheduled, this appointment brightens his chance of becoming a minister in the new government should BJP-Shiv Sena retain power. Fuke started his political journey in 2007 when he was elected as an independent corporator. Between 2007 and 2012, he was in the opposition benches. However, he continued his close relationship with Fadnavis, who was then just a BJP MLA. After winning the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) election second time in 2012 he moved closer to BJP by joining the saffron party led Nagpur Vikas Aghadi. In 2016 he formally joined BJP and contested the legislative council elections from Bhandara-Gondia local body seat. He soundly defeated Rajendra Jain, a close aide of NCP stalwart Praful Patel. He managed to get a BJP ticket for NMC elections in 2017 and ensured his victory. Even though Fuke joined BJP in 2016 he was closely associated with Fadnavis since years. He help the CM during Vidhan Sabha elections in 2009 and 2014. Even while in the opposition in NMC, he rarely took an antigovernment stand and was considered to be a neutral. Fuke\u2019s career in BJP received a boost when the then MP Nana Patole from Bhandara-Gondia quit the party in 2017 and joined Congress. The MLC emerged from Patole\u2019s shadow to become a prominent leader in the two districts. The MLC had to bite dust when BJP lost the Lok Sabha assembly election from the constituency in May 2018. Patole and Patel had joined hands in the bypoll to ensure victory of their candidate Madhukar Kukde. Fuke however, did not lose heart and along with Bawankule he charged up the party workers for the general elections. Most political pundits felt that NCP would win from Bhandara-Gondia as BJP had lost the bypoll. However, the saffron candidate Sunil Mendhe won by 1.97 lakh votes giving a big boost to Fuke\u2019s career. In fact Fuke had been offered the ticket but he refused. Fuke\u2019s close association with TOI-MT Parinay Fuke was closely associated with TOI-MT during the Nag River campaign. He tabled a proposal in NMC House to name the square near TOI-MT office as \u2018Times Square\u2019. He then followed up with the administration to ensure that the proposal was implemented.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Some of the promises they had made were kept and some remained to be fulfilled,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems that some have not been able to digest their defeat. Look at what is taking place in Bengal. It is the responsibility of those at the helm to prevent such happenings. Those who have lost should take the defeat sportingly and the winners should also not be taken over by pride,\u201d said Bhagwat. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps the fear of losing the next elections that has led to violence against political workers. After all these are just elections in which parties only compete to win people\u2019s mandate and this is no war where any bloodshed takes place,\u201d he said. Saying that certain elements are trying to divide the nation for their vested interests, Bhagwat said if they succeed, what was achieved after 70 years of Independence would be wiped out soon. He warned the ruling party of the Trojan horse in the hiding. Bhagwat also evoked Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar citing that he had stressed brotherhood was the need of hour to keep the freedom intact. \u201cBoth freedom and equality cannot come in equal measure. To maintain a balance between the two what the country needed was brotherhood,\u201d he said citing Ambedkar.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

Ironically, he had earlier been allegedly allowed to walk away from custody in the same case, on the intervention of an IPS officer in January 2018. He was sent to magisterial custody on June 15 by the court. Salunkhe, earlier an accused in a murder where Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA) was invoked, is learnt to be a close associate of dreaded Ippa gang. He had been booked in a case of assault on cops in an incident of December 26 in 2017. The offence against Salunkhe and 10 others, including gangster Ippa\u2019s brothers Naushad and Irshad, was registered at Pachpaoli police station. On December 26, 2017, cops had gone to arrest members of the Ippa gang near the railway tracks adjoining Nova Company at Motibagh in connection with a case of attempt to murder registered at Tehsil police station for attacking a rival the previous day. The gangsters had managed to flee after showering bricks on crime branch cops and also damaging their vehicle. MCOCA was invoked against the Ippa gang in the offence registered at Tehsil police station but questionable intervention of senior officers led to removal of a goon\u2019s name from the charge sheet. The goon\u2019s kin is allegedly close to a senior politician from city. Salunkhe was rounded up by crime branch\u2019s unit number three and taken to their Lakdapool police chowky in January last year. Unconfirmed sources claimed that while recording his statement crime branch officials received a call from a top police officer. After this Salunkhe was been let off. A senior IPS officer had told TOI that Salunkhe was not present at the site as per his cell phone location and other evidence, which prompted the decision to let him go from custody. After that, police have till date been unable to trace the Ippa brothers Naushad and Irshad. Salunkhe too had been let off. With crucial arrests pending, the charge sheet could not be sent in the case. Sub-inspector Anant Wadatkar of Pachpaoli police station said the charge sheet would be sent soon now. \u201cThere was adequate evidence against Salunkhe for police to arrest him. There were statements of witnesses and other details which justified his arrest,\u201d said Wadatkar. \u201cSalunkhe also had cases of murder and three to four other offences against him,\u201d he said. Wadatkar, skirting controversies, said Salunkhe had managed to flee from Lakdapool and no one had let him go.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The e-buses, which will be pink in colour, will ferry women passengers only. The buses will be added to NMC\u2019s Aapli Bus fleet by July end, said transport committee chairman Bunty Kukde. The 32-seater midi bus will cost around Rs 1.29 crore each. The civic body had received Rs9.60 crore grant from the state government to ply women-only buses under Tejaswani Scheme. Kukde said earlier the civic body had decided to purchase diesel buses, but later decided to purchase electric buses as it will reduce the expenditure substantially and will cause no pollution. Currently, the NMC is plying 328 buses and has no women-only buses. It was a long-pending demand from women commuters to operate special buses for them. Sources said the NMC had received funds from the state government in early 2017. But the civic administration had exhausted the funds. Following directives from Kukde, the administration has made financial provision for electric buses. Kukde said the NMC has started the process to set up a charging station at NMC\u2019s land on old Bhandara Road in Lakadganj area. The charging station can accommodate three buses at a time. Each bus needs three hours for charging and can run for almost 200km. According to Kukde, a bus will consume a unit to run a kilometre.

Expecting that the current output may fall short of demand, farmers are holding on to their crop, which has led to a jump of nearly Rs300 a quintal in last 10 days. However, the bigger gain has been for those dealing in white onions, a rare variety but grown in large quantities in Amravati district. Prices of white onions have gone up by Rs500 a quintal in the last month. Low output of both red and white onions have spurred the prices. Traders say output of the red variety, which accounts for almost 70% of the country\u2019s total produce, is down by 20% while that of white onion has been halved. The latter is largely used in processing industries which dehydrate onion for long-term use. The preserved onion also has major demand in the overseas market. The white onion mainly comes from Bhavnagar district in Gujarat. A fall in produce at Bhavnagar has led to Amravati\u2019s gain. The processing units that mainly depend on Bhavnagar have increased purchases from Vidarbha, said traders in the region. A company has purchased as much as a lakh quintal from Amravati, said trade sources. Last year, the white onion did not fetch more than Rs400 a quintal. This year the rates opened at Rs900 to 1,000 and now have even touched Rs1,600 for the best quality, said Avinash Jastare of M/s LB Company at Amravati. \u201cWhite onions would not be more than 30% of the total onion crop in the country. The white variety is also grown in Dhule and Nashik but in small quantities,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the red onions are being sold at Rs800 to 1,300 a quintal in bulk markets. This is an increase in the range of Rs100 to 300 a quintal. Farmers clear the fields of the onion crop during this part of the year, and prepare for the next harvest. \u201cThe dry spell coupled with excess heat this summer has damaged the crop of red variety too. Farmers are holding on to the produce at their warehouses, and that has led to a jump in prices. The demand from Gulf countries, Sri Lanka and Singapore too has gone up, and the area under cultivation has reduced,\u201d said Manish Bora of M/s Paras Overseas at Nashik. However, a section of traders say despite the bullish trend the farmer may still not stand to gain much. Rather, the fall in output will level the gains made out of a higher price. A source at Afzal Trading Company at Kalamna said the production cost comes to Rs7 a kg for the red variety. So with an average rate of Rs8 to 9 per kg, the farmer may not gain much. For the white variety, the cost goes up to Rs10 a kg, he said.

Let us celebrate this unique moment. I had a few opportunities to have a formal and informal interactions with one of them \u2014 recently appointed Bhushan Gavai \u2014 in personal, professional and institutional capacities from the days he was a practising advocate, then a government pleader and subsequently the judge of the Mumbai High Court (Sharad Bobde is the other judge from Vidarbha in SC). At a personal level, I had an association to gauge an important aspect of his personality deeply nurtured by the philosophy and teachings of the Buddha and rationally shaped by the thinking, thought processes and learning of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. His socio-spiritual orientation indicated to me that he is also having a firm faith in the contributions made by the triad of social saints from Vidarbha \u2014 Sant Gajanan Maharaj, Sant Gadge Baba and Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj manifesting Bhaktiyog, Karmayog and Dhyanyog, respectively, in their community-led actions to arouse the conscious of the masses. This common thread of personal trait had brought us in contact through a common acquaintance around 25 years ago. Gavai is a very spiritually-oriented and rationally thinking person with a pious heart as I could judge him from my association with him. My professional association with him goes to the time when he was the government pleader of the state in the high court and I was a state bureaucrat. I could foresee the in-depth judicial and analytical sharp bent of mind he possessed in the course of those interactions. It helped me throughout my career not only in my role as a bureaucrat but also for educating and advising my colleague and other government officers /advocates as how to strongly put forth/defend the state side in court matters. My institutional association with him was when he had been nominated to be the representative judge of the high court on the selection panel of judicial magistrates. I was the chairman of Maharashtra State Public Service Commission then and shared the panel with him. His vision as to the required capabilities and capacities of the occupants of the lower judiciary and strong sense to aptly assess requisite potential among the candidates was evident looking at the appropriate, pointed and probing questions he posed to them. I must not forget to mention a unique quality found in his personality. He would be absolutely blunt and severely punishing if anyone even made an iota of attempt to breach the protocol, however closely related or associated the one may be claiming to be with him. I may state with conviction that all the qualities envisaged to be rooted in high echelon of any judicial office are inherently ingrained in his person as also revealed by his first name itself as analysed here: B \u2014 Bold yet Balanced, H \u2014 Humane yet Hardcore; U \u2014 Understanding yet Uncompromising; S \u2014 Simple yet Savvy; H \u2014 Head with Heart; A \u2014 Articulate yet Absorbing; N \u2014 Neutral yet Natural.

He brightened the lives of 400-450 villagers by bringing water to their doorstep at a time when the nearest \u2018nullah\u2019 outside the hamlet and a rickety hand pump both had gone dry in the harsh summer this year. Within a fortnight of Balkawade\u2019s visit to Katejhari on May 29, two bore wells were dug at the village and a storage tank constructed. Around 20-22 taps, installed at intermittent distances, would now get water. Though his original mission was to visit the highly sensitive Katejhari village to meet family members of a Maoist and also the villagers, the district police chief won the hearts of the villagers with his water diplomacy. The village is known for its outright support for Maoists. But Balkawade proved that anti-Maoist operations need not always be with guns and grenades. The project, funded under the civic action programme of cops, turned out to be such a big occasion that the villagers wanted it to be inaugurated quickly. Instead of any officer or politician, it was one of the villagers, Bhimaji Kolhe, who inaugurated the water project on Friday. While Kolhe did the honours, the officers of Katejhari armed out post (AOP) sub-inspectors Akshaykumar Gorad, Sagar Warute and Jagannath Menkudle were cheering the event. Balkawade said he had gone to Katejhari to convince the family of a Maoist to surrender under the \u2018Navjeevan' programme and also meet the villagers under \u2018grambhet\u2019 (village meet) to ask them about their grievances. \u201cIt was when I had just started to come back that some women and children approached me with two things. One, they had mentioned about drinking water problem and the other one was the deplorable condition of the Katejhari-Murumgaon road which is riddled with trenches and big pot holes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem of drinking water was solved within a short period and now we are also pushing for the repair of the connecting road through our special funds.

They say so far they had been earning around Rs25,000-30,000 per month by working 16 hours a day. According to them, the company has increased the daily targets to 18 orders (Mon to Thursday) and 22 on weekends which is impossible to achieve and ultimately result in loss of incentives. \u201cWithout incentives, there is no earning for us,\u201d says a delivery boy from Zomato\u2019s Dharampeth zone. These boys have gone offline since last three days demanding rollback of the new policy and employment safeguards. On Sunday, they gathered at Traffic Park where they planned a massive rally to be taken out at Samvidhan Square on Monday. The company has denied any knowledge of the ongoing protest supported by Shiv Sena\u2019s city unit. Zomato city manager Vipul Sinha said he wasn\u2019t aware of the issue before disconnecting TOI\u2019s call.

Shiv Sena city coordinator Nitin Tiwari said the youths are ready to work even 16 hours a day but for earlier pay package. \u201cThey work for per order commission plus weekly incentives. Since Zomato\u2019s entry in Nagpur, they have been delivery food from 7am to 11pm. Some even worked till 4am to meet the demanding targets. All they want is continuation of the same policy,\u201d Tiwari said. Tiwari said the new policy makes completion of 18 orders per day from Monday to Thursday and 22 on weekends a must for incentive payouts between Rs575 to 700. Though the payout is marginally increased, it is impossible to cater the orders within 24 hours, Tiwari said. \u201cNo incentive is paid if you fall short of even one order,\u201d he added. Another delivery agent said each order takes about one to one-and-half hours to complete before they are available for the next order. \u201cWe would need 28 hours to meet the new target. This is impossible. We have been somehow managing 16 orders by working over 16 hours in last one and half years. The distance between restaurant and client has increased now.

NMC sources told TOI Wi-Fi service could not be made completely operational just for want of payment gateway. \u201cNSSCDCL and L&T were supposed to enter into an agreement with a bank for payment gateway. This simple process could not be completed in over 18 months,\u201d sources said. Municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar confirmed that Wi-Fi service was not available after 30 minutes or 200 MB. \u201cI came to know about it recently. I have directed NSSCDCL officials to ensure payment gateway is operational as soon as possible. We will make it operational soon,\u201d he said. Wi-Fi service under Smart and Safe City Project can be beneficial for individuals, institutions and commercial units across the city due to its high speed. An optical fibre cable of 600km has been laid under Smart and Safe City Project. Wi-Fi access points are connected with this network. Therefore, the speed of internet service is 10 MBPS. Also, Wi-Fi access points are established at major squares of the city in busy market places, commercial, administrative zones etc As reported by TOI on April 10, NMC head office and zone offices too were supposed to get free internet service at the speed of 10 MBPS under Smart and Safe City Project, but this has not been possible till date. The civic body is paying high charges to various operators to get internet in its offices. Bangar said this problem will also be solved soon. \u201cI have directed NMC officials to coordinate with NSSCDCL officials and ensure internet services from Smart and Safe City Project,\u201d he said. There are a few more components of Smart and Safe City Project which are yet to be made operational. One of these services is Smart Parking developed along Central Bazaar Road at Ramdaspeth. It is pending just for want of appointment of an agency for operation and maintenance.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli. In Video:No Murli Manohar Joshi in BJP list of 43Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}}
