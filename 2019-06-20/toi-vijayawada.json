You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

From stupas to forts, AP\u2019s culture showcases are diverse and give ample tourism opportunities. APTA is taking steps to promote adventure bike rides in possible tourism locations like Araku Valley, Maredumilli, Konaseema, Gandikota and Horsley Hills. These locations have great possibilities to promote motorbike tours and the best possible months for bike tourism is from September to March. Speaking to TOI, chief marketing officer (CMO) of APTA M Srinivas Rao acknowledges that infrastructure still needs to be developed to aid bike tourists. \u201cHowever, we have sufficient accomodations in destinations like Araku, Dindi in Konaseema and Maredumilli. The best route in AP for a bike tour would be from Maredumilli till Araku, if one wants to experience both scenic beauty as well as adventure,\u201d Rao said. Officials go on to say that many make a trip from Chennai to Tada falls, Pulicat Lake and Sriharikota region.

He also urged the parliamentary affairs minister to chalk out ways to improve the business of parliament. \u201cStrengthening the committee system could go a long way in improving the quality of laws drafted and minimize potential implementation charges,\u201d Naidu said in the letter.

The opposition party alleged that the governor\u2019s speech did not include key topics such as Amaravati development, Polavaram Project and industrial policy. Both Houses of the legislature have begun the debate on the motion thanking governor ESL Narasimhan for his address on June 14. In the assembly, government whip Budi Mutyala Naidu moved the motion, seconded by Kakani Govardhan Reddy. They said the government headed by Y S Jaganmohan Reddy is giving priority to neglected sections and farmers. They accused the TDP government of indulging in heavy corruption in Polavaram Project and Pattiseema lift irrigation scheme. TDP leader K Atchannaidu found fault with the governor not acknowledging development in the last five years. He questioned the government for not making any mention of Amaravati and Polavaram Project. He welcomed the ruling party\u2019s decision to order probe into irrigation projects and asked them to prove the charges. He dared them to stop Pattiseema scheme, if YSRC found it useless as some members claimed. \u201cIf you think Pattiseema is a wasteful project, I would advise you to stop pumping water from the scheme for this season and see what the farmers would say,\u201d Atchannaidu said. He found fault with the government handing over some buildings of AP to Telangana, without settling the institutions listed in Schedule IX and X of the AP Reorganisation Act. He also wanted the government to check with the energy department and ensure there are no power cuts in the state. Finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy blamed the TDP government for not getting funds from the central government or get Schedule IX and X institutions bifurcated in the last four years when the TDP was in alliance with BJP. On developmental issues, the minister said the TDP government had utilised the spillover funds from the 13th finance commission, full funds from the 14th finance commission and funds from MNREGS. \u201cWhatever was spent from these funds had gone mostly to Janma Bhoomi committees ignoring the elected gram panchayat sarpanches and ward members,\u201d the minister said.

The family was originally from Tsundur town in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s Guntur district and were living in the US for at least the past two decades. On Saturday at around 10 am, a local resident contacted the emergency number 911 after being informed about gun shots being heard in Chandrasekhar\u2019s house. Police officials, who rushed to the spot, found the four lying dead with gunshot wounds. Sources close to the family said that they had moved into the house only in March. Speaking to TOI, a family friend who is also a member of Telugu Association of North America (TANA) said on condition of anonymity that Chandrasekhar has been suffering from depression for a while and that there might have been a dispute in the family. In an Instagram post, local police explained that at the time of the shooting, other family members, including two adults and two children, were living in the house as guests. After discovering the bodies, one of them rushed out looking for help. He found someone who then called up 911. The police have not revealed the identity of the guests. Although the police have not given any details about the motive behind the shooting, they have stated that there is no immediate threat to the community and that the deaths directly affect their family friends and co-workers. They have also said that investigations had revealed that at the time of the gun being fired, no outsider had entered the house. This is being interpreted by many that a family dispute may be behind the deaths. Chandrasekhar worked for the Iowa department of public safety\u2019s technology services bureau. Sources added that Lavanya too was a software developer. Friends and acquaintances cited his work excellence certificates claiming that he was hard working employee.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

From Wednesday itself, all personnel from constable to inspector ranks will start getting offs. Director general of police (DGP) Gautam Sawang ordered this after a meeting with the committee constituted to formulate guidelines on weekly offs. This comes in spite of the fact that the police department is facing a severe staff crunch. There is about 20% staff shortage in the department. The committee, headed by additional director general of police Ravishankar Ayyannar, gave its report with 19 alternative plans that will fit various units like intelligence, CID, SPF and greyhounds. The unit heads can choose any plan depending upon their convenience, said Ayyannar. While some states have earlier tried to implement weekly offs, they have been limited to pilot projects only. With implementation of weekly offs, cumulative staff crunch in the department will be 30 per cent as one-seventh of the staff will be off duties. Ayyannar went on to say that an IT dashboard will be created to monitor the weekly offs in all districts and special units from the DGP\u2019s office. The system will be reviewed after a month to deal with the problems that arise in implementation. Police officers\u2019 associations across the state welcomed the decision.

A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years.

Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing.

Many major retailers continue to violate the law as they would rather be fined once than lose a major source of income from customers. In their defence, retailers say that manufacturing these bags cost much more than disposable bags and they have already laid out a suggestive notice to bring their own bags. The public can keep the bill where they have been charged for branded carry bags and lodge a complaint through the Meekosam mobile application.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

In last five years, Vijayawada\u2019s pollution score has worsened from 63 to 72 in the global pollution index. While the city does not outrank metros like Chennai, Bengaluru, Mumbai or Delhi, it stands at the sixth place among two-tier cities in the country. In 2014, Vijayawada stood at 111th place in the pollution index. While the city is certainly not as polluted as Delhi, its pollution level is ranked \u2018extremely high\u2019. However, Vijayawada has a lesser greenery in comparison with Delhi. The global pollution index publishes its findings on a real-time basis based upon scores given by residents of a particular city. Apart from air quality, residents of Vijayawada gave the city the lowest scores in garbage disposal systems and general comfort. Vijayawada is worse off than Visakhapatnam which achieved a score of 68.01 and was ranked 106th globally. Other two-tier cities which have ranked better than Vijayawada include Pune, Ahmedabad, Dehradun, Madurai, Thane, Nagpur, Vadodara, Coimbatore and Indore. The least polluted two-tier city in India is Mangalore which secured the 263rd place in the global pollution index.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal.

The NIA argued that the special court, while granting bail to Srinivasa Rao, did not give any reasons. The Suppression of Unlawful Acts against Safety of Civil Aviation Act mandates to give reasons while granting bail to the accused, according to section 6A of the Act.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

On Wednesday, YSRCP workers in a village in Guntur constructed a wall across a road to prevent TDP workers from using it. In another incident, YSRCP workers in Prakasam district dug up a cement road laid by the previous TDP government about 10 months ago alleging that the people using the road had not voted for YSRCP in the assembly polls. The police had to intervene in both villages to maintain law and order. A picket was posted at Ponugupadu village of Phirangipuram mandal in Guntur district where a three-feet wall was raised blocking the village thoroughfare. Since incident has a caste angle, the police held a peace meeting between the rival TDP and YSRCP groups. A majority of TDP supporters are from an upper caste, while YSRC supporters belong to Scheduled Castes. YSRC supporters have claimed the wall was built to prevent encroachment by TDP men as the land used for the road was on private property, but TDP supporters maintained the road belonged to revenue department and was been used for the last 80 years. Phirangipuram SI D Srihari said the claims have been referred to the revenue department and in the meantime the area has been kept out of bounds for public. Political workers dig up cement roadEarlier, there have been incidents of demolition of flag posts and party arches and attacks on political opponents in Narasaraopet, Sattenapalli, Macherla and Gurazala assembly constituencies in Guntur. These constituencies fall under Palnadu region, once known for its faction feuds. In the other incident at Uppalapadu village in Kanigiri assembly constituency in Prakasam district, a cement road was dug up with an excavator. The road was laid at Muslim Colony around 10 months ago. The road was dug up as the residents allegedly supported the TDP candidate in the just-concluded assembly elections. A complaint has been lodged with the police. Meanwhile, the situation at Manchikallu, Pinnelli, Machavaram Mutyalampadu and Tangeda villages turned serious as local TDP leaders fled fearing attacks. About 70 families in Pinnelli supported the TDP in the recent elections. They are taking shelter at Gamalapadu near Dachepalli. They met Guntur rural SP seeking protection.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

He said the building where Naidu has been staying is illegal as it was constructed on a riverbed. Only a few days ago, Naidu wrote to the state government seeking permission to use Praja Vedika, an extension to his residential building, for official purpose to meet party workers. Naidu, as leader of the opposition, enjoys the status of a Cabinet minister. He had sought utilisation of the building complex as part of his official entitlement. While the state government is yet to respond to Naidu\u2019s request, Ramakrishna Reddy, who defeated Naidu\u2019s son and political heir Nara Lokesh in recent assembly elections, told media that Naidu would be evicted from his residence. The government will use all legal process to evict him as the building is an illegal construction in violation of environment norms. The building is owned by an industrialist and the previous state government had hired it for Naidu as official residence. Ramakrishna Reddy had earlier moved high court over the constructions made on the right bank of Krishna River in Guntur district. Reddy alleged that all houses constructed on the river bank including that of Chandrababu Naidu are illegal. He argued in his petition that all these constructions are made in violation of River Conservation Act. Ramakrishna Reddy on Tuesday said the house where Naidu is residing is \u201cdefinitely an illegal construction and our legal fight against all illegal constructions will continue till they are vacated and demolished. We will make Naidu to vacate the illegal construction through legal process,\u201d he said. He also criticised Naidu for staying in illegal construction. Naidu made tall claims over construction of capital Amaravati but he did not even have his own house in Amaravati whereas chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy build his house at Tadepalli, he said. Naidu has been staying in the riverside bungalow for the last four years after the state administration moved to Vijayawada from Hyderabad. The house belonged to a private person but the previous government took it on lease basis for the official residence of chief minister. Later the government constructed \u2018Praja Vedika\u2019, a meeting hall to conduct meetings. TDP MLA Payyavula Keshav said YSRC is resorting to vindictive politics. On one hand, the chief minister says they will not do any vindictive politics but their MLAs come up with statements like this.

While directing the officers to take strict action, school education commissioner Sandhya Rani said on Wednesday: \u201cThe Government is yet to finalise the guidelines for implementation of Amma Vodi. Trying to take advantage of the scheme without proper guidelines is violation of rules.\u201d On the other hand, enrolments in government schools have witnessed a steep jump since the chief minister\u2019s announcement of the Amma Vodi scheme. Government schools reported to have enrolled nearly 85,000 students in a week. The scheme, which offers cash incentive to mothers for sending their wards to schools, has attracted a lot of clamour already and the two main sparring parties have been private and government schools. While government school teachers demand that the Amma Vodi benefits should be confined exclusively to the public education system, many private schools have already started publicising on the lines of Amma Vodi. What\u2019s odd is that the education department hasn\u2019t yet been able to decide upon the guidelines for implementation of the scheme. Sources say that the government might extend the benefit to all schools public and private since chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy thinks that infrastructure in the public schools is not developed enough to absorb the additional flow. The government might, in fact, limit the scheme after two years when infrastructure is developed and public schools are ready to take in a bigger population of students. It is estimated that about 55 per cent of students (till high school) go to government schools while 45 per cent go to private schools. \u201cThe buildings are not suited to accommodate more students and the teacher strength is poor. We might require at least 20,000 additional teachers to make Amma Vodi work,\u201d said a government school teacher. However, experts are of the view that the government should extend the coverage of Amma Vodi to only those private schools which have infrastructure as per the recognition rules. They contend that this would either make private schools upgrade their facilities or opt out of the scheme. \u201cWhile it is true that government school infrastructure is not up to the mark, the situation in most private schools is horrible,\u201d said an educationist Dr DAR Subramanyam.

Another man Khaleel, an autorickshaw driver by profession too suffered severe burn injuries in the process. The deceased was identified as Hajinissa (50). According to Penamaluru inspector V Peddiraju, the 50-year-old accused Nafeesa (name changed) was in an alleged extra-marital affair with her brother-in-law Khaleel for the past five years. Over the years, Nafeesa grew jealous of Khaleel\u2019s wife and decided to kill her in her sleep. The incident happened at around 9am in the morning after Nafeesa\u2019s husband Karim who is a daily wage labourer at Auto Nagar left for work. Nafeesa then walked into Khaleel\u2019s room and found him sleeping next to another woman whom she assumed to be his wife. However, it was Hajnissa (Khaleel\u2019s sister) who was actually sleeping next to him under the blanket. Investigation revealed that Nafeesa was angry that Khaleel has been avoiding her in the recent past and decided to take the extreme measure. \u201cIn order to avoid any family disputes, Khaleel has been distancing himself from her and was focusing on his own family,\u201d Peddiraju told TOI. She mistakenly poured petrol on her and set her ablaze. As she was burning in agony, Nafeesa realized her mistake and in the process Khaleel too suffered severe burn injuries. Neighbours rushed to the room and put out the fire and dialed 100 where within moments, cops reached the spot and found out about the whole story. Khaleel was rushed to Vijayawada Government General Hospital (GGH) where his condition is said to be critical. A case under section 302 of IPC (murder) was registered against Nafeesa.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

Unofficial sources say, Chandrasekhar had killed his wife and sons before shooting himself. West Des Moines police released an update on their Facebook page confirming the suicide and said that they are treating the other deaths as homicides without pressing any charges as of now. Dallas county sheriff Chad Leonard issued a statement to a local website saying that Chandrasekhar was issued a permit to carry weapons in April. Leonard also stated that at least one weapon was purchased after the permit was issued but they are yet to ascertain when the weapon was purchased and where. It has been revealed that the two guests who were staying at Sunkara\u2019s residence were Chandrasekhar\u2019s in-laws.   On Saturday morning, Chandrasekhar\u2019s wife Lavanya (41) and the couple's sons Prabhas (14) and Suhas (10) were all killed in their sleep. Cops said that the in-laws had first tried to call 911 but could not communicate and then ran outside and requested the neighbours to make the call in their stead. \u201cUnofficially, it has been found that Chandrasekhar killed his wife and two children. The in-laws heard the first gunshot but Chandrasekhar said that it was some cracker in the neighbourhood. Later, three more gunshots were heard by the elderly couple,\u201d president of Telugu Association of North America (TANA) Satish Vemana said. Cops, however, have declined to comment about what could have motivated the killings or suicide. Meanwhile, the last rites of the Sunkara family took place at Caldwell parish funeral home at Urbandale in Iowa on Tuesday morning. Satish explained that the cremation took place in US as the in-laws did not want the bodies to be taken to India.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "BJP List 2019 Maharashtra": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/two-sitting-mps-from-state-denied-tickets-in-bjps-list/articleshow/68514735.cms", "description": "AURANGABAD/KOLHAPUR: Sitting MPs Sunil Gaikwad (Latur) and Dilip Gandhi (Ahmednagar) were denied tickets for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in the BJP\u2019s first national list of candidates announced on Thursday. The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination. His late grandfather, Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, was long associated with the Congress. | Full coverage of Lok Sabha elections in MaharashtraAmong other prominent leaders from Maharashtra in the first list of candidates are Union minister Nitin Gadkari from his hometown Nagpur, state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve from Jalna, Union MoS Hansraj Ahir from Chandrapur and Union MoS for defence Subash Bhamre from Dhule.

Sitting MP from Sangli Sanjay Patil has also been renominated, putting an end to speculation over any change in constituency. Patil\u2019s candidature was opposed by a section of BJP leaders in Sangli. However, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is understood to have called a meeting of local party leaders and resolved the differences. The party has also given tickets to Heena Gavit from Nandurbar, Raksha Khadse from Raver, Poonam Mahajan from Mumbai North Central, Kapil Patil from Bhiwandi, Sanjay Dhotre from Akola, Ramdas Tadas from Wardha, Ashok Nete from Gadchiroli and Gopal Shetty from Mumbai North.
