A surprise pick by the ruling BJP-led NDA   , Birla's name was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself for the post, sources said. The 56-year-old leader is considered to be close to both Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah. Birla's nomination for the Lok Sabha Speaker's post also has the   backing of non-NDA parties   such as the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). Starting his political journey as a student leader, Birla was also elected to the Rajasthan Assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. He won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was again elected this year from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. Birla defeated Congress's Ramnarayan Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently-concluded general election. A conscientious parliamentarian, Birla has registered an 86-per cent average attendance in the House, asked 671 questions, participated in 163 debates and introduced six private members' bills in the 16th Lok Sabha. From 1991 to 2003, he was a key leader in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) as a state-level president first and then, as a vice-president at the national level. Birla, who holds a Masters degree in commerce, is a member of the Standing Committee on Energy in Parliament, the Committee on Petitions and the Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. He succeeds eight-time MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Lok Sabha Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this is not the first time that a relative newcomer has occupied the position. In 1996, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader G M C Balayogi, also a two-time MP then, was elected as the Speaker in the Lower House of Parliament. After his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

He cited the example of Metro-III project which was delayed by nearly nine months due to litigations and as a result, its cost escalated by nearly Rs 1,000 crore. Fadnavis made the statement while replying to NCP\u2019s Rahul Narwekar who pointed out that several government projects, especially those related to city\u2019s infrastructure development, were being delayed. Narwekar demanded that the government pass a legislation that puts a time cap on disposal of projects that are of of public importance and cost above Rs 100 crore. \u201cIn case of the coastal road project, a group of residents from south Mumbai approached the court recently to get stay on the work. Litigations have also hampered work of other big-ticket projects in the recent past like the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link, Shivaji Smarak and the RoRo project,\u201d Narwekar said. Responding to Narvekar\u2019s demand, the CM said he will refer it to the law and judiciary department to see if the government can come up with a solution without interfering with the powers of the court. \u201cApart from litigations, clearances too take a lot of time. It took close to two years and six sittings to get the central environment ministry\u2019s nod for the coastal road project notification. We now have all the necessary permissions. The Centre has put a condition that there should be a dedicated corridor for public transport on the coastal road, and we have agreed to it,\u201d the CM informed the council. Transport experts have suggested that BEST buses get a dedicated lane on the coastal road and be exempted of toll. \u201cThis will encourage people to shift to public transport to travel along the south-north corridor and keep cars away,\u201d said an expert.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

The district administration has ordered inquiry into the matter. Rudraprayag district magistrate Mangesh Ghildiyal told TOI that the deceased, Vinod Vyas, 52, was a resident of Goregaon in Mumbai West. \u201cHe complained of breathlessness in the temple after which he was taken to a health camp. The doctors at the health camp referred him to a bigger health centre in Guptakashi.

A division bench of Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice Nitin Jamdar are hearing PILs against the South Coastal Road (SCR)-a 10km stretch of the entire coastal road. As per the 1991 CRZ notification, reclamation was prohibited in coastal areas. However, in 2015, changes were made to the rules to permit reclamation in CRZ areas for the purpose of constructing a coastal road. \"Was any scientific study undertaken? What was the material that was considered (before the change in rules)?\" the judges asked the counsel representing the Union. The PILs claimed that work, including reclamation activities, started last year on the proposed 10km-long SCR stretch from Marine Lines to Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Worli without obtaining environmental clearance. The BMC and the state have claimed no environmental clearance was required for SCR as it was a linear road and not a area development project. The project has obtained CRZ nods, the authorities said. Senior advocate Janak Dwarakadas, counsel for the petitioners, claimed no public hearings were required for the CRZ approvals, but were necessary for the environmental clearances. The advocate pointed out that the recommendations by the environmental assessment committee were cleared in a day and \"there was no application of mind\". The advocate added that the authorities had initially applied for approvals for the entire 35km project. But when they were refused approval, they split the project into two and sought permissions for the SCR and north coastal road saying that they were standalone projects, independent of each other as they were divided by the sea link. Dwarakadas said the same set of documents were submitted for the second application. \"A project costing over Rs 12,000 crore, providing a complex transportation passageway consisting of a network of roads, roads on stilts and reclaimed surfaces, tunnels and undersea tunnels on at least 160 hectares of reclaimed land with substations, police chowkies, parking, bus bays, cycle tracks, approaches and recreational areas ought to undergo an environmental clearance as an area development activity as envisaged in the 2006 Environmental Impact Assessment Notification,\" the petitioners said.

Justice S J Kathawalla recently dismissed an arbitration petition filed by Provident Multi-Trading Pvt Ltd, which was declared a successful bidder by Maharastra Maritime Board (MMB) in 2017, observing that such a public project can't be delayed any further. Justice Kathawalla's May 30 order, made available this week, vacated the stay on MMB's new tender for providing the Ro-Ro service, for which infrastructure has been ready since over a year. \"...A public contract, such as the present one, ought to commence at the earliest and operate at its maximum capacity at all times irrespective of any disputes and claims that may have arisen between the contracting parties,\" the judge said. As if thinking in tandem, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday said he was keen to expedite the Ro-Ro project and if need be, state departments could purchase its own vessel. Replying to a question on infrastructure projects, he said: \"The Ro-Ro service is embroiled in legal wra- ngles...infrastructure is ready and the services will benefit scores of citizens. So it will be wise to procure our own vessel and run the service...\" Provident Multi-Trading , along with a consortium, submitted its bid in November 2017, providing a description of two vessels, but not their names. It approached the HC aft- er the MMB terminated the contract citing non-compliance of conditions. The HC had then observed that only one vessel had reached the city. Sharan Jagtiani and Karl Tamboly, counsels for the firm, argued that as a successful bidder, it should be allowed to 'go ahead' and MMB can't be allowed to terminate the contract and issue new bids. But former additional solicitor general Darius Khambata, with counsels Shiraz Rustomjee and Ishwar Nankani, argued against any relief being granted. Khambata relied on a newly introduced Section 20-A which is intended to cut delay in public project, to justify MMB's action. Justice Kathawalla said he was not inclined to grant any interim relief even based on the facts.

Navi Mumbai builders who are members of CREDAI-MCHI (Raigad) had filed a complaint with MahaRera, seeking that the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) be made a co-promoter of their projects. They contended that Cidco delays its obligations after selling the plots and, as a result, their projects get held up and they are held liable for the delay. They said Cidco must be made a promoter under Rera because it is a public authority and MCHI members are allottees of plots owned by Cidco. MahaRera chairperson Gautam Chatterjee ruled that the sale transactions effected by Cidco are sale of immovable property where permissions for development is yet to be given by the competent authority. \"Such transaction does not fall under the definition of a real estate project,\" he said. The order said Cidco can be made a promoter along with the builder in cases where Cidco is mandated to develop \"off-site infrastructure\" around the plot. In its complaint, MCHI said that Cidco does not register tenders inviting bids with Rera even though it was mandated to do so. \"Cidco has not followed the provisions of Rera in its agreements and dealings with the highest bidder and is contravening the provisions of Rera,\" it said . The complainant said that Cidco is required to register the scheme as a project with Rera prior to advertising, marketing and inviting bids for the plots. Besides, Cidco is liable for various obligations to be performed pre- and post-tender like removal of encroachments and encumbrances, final demarcation of plot, providing water and drainage connections. The builders, who plan to file an appeal against Chatterjee's order, said Cidco frequently delays carrying out these tasks. As a result, they face flak from flat buyers, who drag them before the housing authority for project delays. \"Cidco falls under the ambit of 'promoter' under Rera and its activities of inviting bids for plots and allotment of the same for lease of 60 years fall under the provisions of Rera,\" said the builders. Counsel for Cidco said the corporation sold plots after a public tender to prospective developers to develop and construct flats to be sold to third parties. \"There we are not liable to register the sale of such plots with MahaRera,\" he said. In his order, Chatterjee said if the developer's plot acquired from Cidco is dependent on certain off-site infrastructure that has to be provided by Cidco, then \"while registering their projects with MahaRera, the builders can include Cidco as a promoter (land-owner)\".

The order was on an application by special public prosecutor Raja Thakare for time to make arrangements to video record the bail proceedings as directed earlier. The court observed that the SC/ST (prevention of atrocities) Act was amended a couple of years ago to require video recording of all proceedings in offences under the Act, but infrastructure is yet to be put in place. The state has to provide the infrastructure and in Maharashtra it hasn\u2019t. Aabad Ponda, counsel for the accused doctor trio argued at length that video recording of bail proceeding is not necessary at all. The court said that this issue was already decided earlier by it. Thakare said the reason for seeking time is that the police is unable to provide for the video recording soon. Advocate Gunratan Sadavarte appearing for the first informant in the case also argued at length said the court order. His main contention was that the state and police machinery \u201care not serious about atrocities on SC/ST and failed to protect the community\u2019s interest.\u2019\u2019 The sessions court tried to \u201cfind a solution\u201d at least for the Tadvi case but the Judge observed that police has \u201cgenuine\u2019 difficulties. Police is not a private party which can spend funds at will, it receives funds which has to be spent for tasks allotted by the government said the court adding that the state, not police, provides court with infrastructure. But acknowledging bonafides of the investigating officer who has sought the infrastructure, the Judge said it would take even up to two years. The court said there was substance in Sadavarte\u2019s submission of necessity of video recording to ensure rights of victims and the lack of any such recording in \u201cthousands of cases\u2019\u2019 in the last couple of years. His submission has highlighted the issue and will help government to think about it \u201cseriously\u2019\u2019 and \u201cexpeditiously\u2019\u2019 take steps to provide necessary infrastructure for video recording, said the Judge. The order said that hearing of the bail plea sans videorecording \u201cwould not cause any prejudice to the interest of the informant\u2019\u2019 and places the bail hearing for June 21. Three senior doctors of a civic-run hospital, were arrested for allegedly abetting the suicide of a junior colleague by harassing and making casteist remarks against her. The three doctors were-- Hema Ahuja, Bhakti Mehere and Ankita Khandelwal -- all are attached to the B Y L Nair Hospital in South Mumbai. After Tadvi ended her life on May 22, her family alleged that the doctors taunted and hurled casteist abuses at her as she belonged to a scheduled tribe. The accused were subsequently booked under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Anti-Ragging Act, Information Technology Act and section 306 ,IPC for abetment to suicide.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing. Living with the dead: A grave in the backyard\"All we are asking for is some land for our ancestors. There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar. Their burial grounds are filled to capacity,\" said Nizam Khan, a mechanic. Village pradhan Sundar Kumar said that he had asked officials several times for a burial ground for Muslim families, but no action was taken. Ravi Kumar NG, the district magistrate, said that he was not aware of the issue. \"I will send an official team to the village and get details of the burial land required.\" Picture Credit: Hemant Kumar In Video:Houses turn into graveyards as Muslims in this UP village bury the dead at homeDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Satta Market": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-assembly-polls-satta-market-bets-shift-from-winner-loser-to-seat-tally/articleshow/66726353.cms", "description": "BHOPAL: This assembly  is turning out to be a nail-biter. The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

The reason given is that these structures have become old and dilapidated. But the question on everyone' Why has the BMC woken up all of a sudden? \"This appears to be a knee-jerk reaction following the fatal Himalaya FOB crash at CSMT in March,\" says G R Vora, a member of the F-North ward Citizens' Federation and resident of Sion where two FOBs at King Circle were recently shut for inspection. \"Civic officials first neglected bridge maintenance and have now realized that many are beyond repair and have to be pulled down.\" Of the 29 bridges classified as 'dangerous', eight have been razed and over a dozen shut for vehicular and pedestrian movement. The two FOBs at King Circle are not part of the 'dangerous' bridges list, but have been shut after the re-audit dound some damages in the structures. Additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal, in charge of civic bridges department, says: \"We did not want to close all these bridges, but were left with no choice. We cannot play with people's lives. We are looking at alternative traffic arrangements and solutions.\" Short-staffed departmentA study of the reasons for the sudden closures exposes serious gaps in the functioning of the country's richest municipal body-to start with, a severely short-staffed bridges department that is barely six years old. Of the sanctioned 104 posts, 47 are vacant. This means there are only 57 staffers overseeing 300-plus bridges, FOBs, vehicular and pedestrian subways and skywalks, including the 29 'dangerous' bridges aged between two and six decades. The numerous vacancies in existing posts seems ironic considering the department has asked for an extra 116 new posts to be created. Prior to 2013, city bridges were maintained by the roads and traffic department and an assistant engineer (bridges) would report to the road department head. But with more bridges coming up across the city, the need was felt for a dedicated bridges department. The first chief engineer of the new department was S O Kori, who is currently behind bars in the Himalaya FOB crash incident for 'lack of supervision'. Nitai Mehta, founder and managing trustee of NGO Praja Foundation whose recent report analysed the staff crunch in BMC, says: \"The fundamental problem is the corporation today is only fire-fighting instead of looking at long-term solutions...Many of these bridges are a part of the old infrastructure and need to undergo periodic inspections and maintenance. Instead, the administration is focused on constructing new infrastructure to create ribbon-cutting moments.\" Also, the number of vehicles on roads is rapidly increasing, putting pressure on infrastructure. As on March 2019, there were over 36.4 lakh vehicles on city roads (up from 33.5 lakh in 2018), of which 58.6% were two-wheelers, 29.3% cars, jeeps, station wagons, 3.7% taxis/cabs, 5.8% autos, 0.4% buses and 2.2% goods vehicles. 'Few checks, bad upkeep'BMC's bridges manual, that was brought out in 2011, says assistant engineers must inspect bridges twice a year-in April and in October. Accordingly, major/minor repairs, if required, need to be taken up. The inquiry conducted by the civic vigilance department in the Himalaya FOB crash incident blamed the department for not following the manual. The first-ever audit done by the department was only after the tragic 2016 Mahad bridge collapse on Savitri river in Raigad. The audit covered 253 brid- ges-150 in western suburbs, 64 in eastern suburbs and 39 in the island city. The report was delayed and it was only after the pedestrian section of Andheri's Gokhale bridge collapsed on July 3, 2018, that corporators demanded its immediate release. The report had recommended demolition of 14 'dangerous' bridges-six in western suburbs, five in eastern suburbs and three in the island city-major repairs for 61 structures and minor repairs for 107. But six months later, in March 2019, when the Himalaya FOB, which was found to be in a 'good condition' in the audit, crashed, a re-audit was sought. This re-audit added 15 more bridges to the 'dangerous' list taking the total number to 29. The BMC has spent nearly Rs 2.5 crore on the structural audits of the bridges. A senior, independent expert underscored the significance of such checks. \"Usually after a bridge is constructed, there is need for periodic maintenance and repairs after 30 years. But it is often seen that during repairs, new layers are added without removing the earlier layers, which adds to the dead load,\" says Shirish Sukhtame, former president of Practicing Engineers Architects and Town Planners Association. Most bridges have a deck type construction with two girders as side support, but the deck in between, on which people walk, is much thinner. \"During structural audits, owing to this layer over layer, the welding joints are not accessible. There is a need to routinely check the structure and replace anything if required, but part by part, without inconveniencing the public,\" adds Sukhtame. Clearly, such a system is absent. Chetan Raikar, a structural engineer, also suggests fundamental changes in the work culture. \"Engineers should get both classroom and on-job training once they are inducted,\" he adds.

A similar complaint was made against the principal by a teacher of the college where he was previously employed. The principal has denied the allegations and said the complaints were made with malicious intent. On Tuesday, members of Prahar Students Organisation and Nationalist Students Congress staged a protest at the college premises. \u201cIn spite of an FIR, the police have not taken any action and the college allows him to continue as principal,\u201d said Ajay Tapkir, secretary, Prahar Students Organisation. The issue came to the fore earlier this month when Shiv Sena MLC Neelam Gorhe demanded his resignation. \u201cThe first complainant lost her job because she raised the issue. She has been following up on it since 2007 and has also written to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. The second complainant learnt of the first case and decided to speak up about the inappropriate behaviour at a conference,\u201d said Gorhe. The principal told TOI: \u201cIt appears that a conspiracy has been hatched against me to tarnish my clean image. Earlier, the university\u2019s women\u2019s commission had dismissed such a complaint made by a teacher and hence she had filed a complaint with Tilak Nagar police station in 2018 for the alleged 2007 incident. In the second case, the person has filed a similar type of complaint in January 2019 for the alleged incident in October 2016. It\u2019s obviously not a coincidence. I am being maliciously implicated by someone who wants to tarnish my image and the institution\u2019s image. My innocence will be proved anyway but if such defamatory complaints are entertained, then there will be chaos in every organisation.\u201d Juhu police senior inspector Pandrinath Wavhal said the case is under investigation and thus no details can be revealed.

The fastest train between the cities is Rajdhani Express (15 hours, 50 minutes). It departs from New Delhi at 4.25pm and arrives at Mumbai Central at 8.15am the next day. It halts at five stations, covering 1,386km and its maximum speed is 110-120kmph. Western Railway chief public relations officer Ravinder Bhakar said, \u201cWe have to upgrade tracks and sleepers so that rails can handle 160kmph. We are chalking out the plan as more sleepers (density) will be required, level-crossings have to eliminated, and fencing is needed to prevent trespassing and cattle being run over.\u201d The proposal, part of the railway\u2019s 100-day action of the Narendra Modi government, will have to be cleared by the cabinet committee on economic affairs and the Union cabinet before a tender is floated. The 52kg rails will be replaced by 62kg ones and 90 ultimate tensile strength. Sleeper density too will have to be increased so that the tracks stay firm when trains pass at a speed of 160kmph. There is no need for alterations in signalling. The aim is to bring the system to a level where trains can run at 130kmph with push-and-pull technology. In the next phase, the speed will be increased to 160kmph. WR plans to reduce travel time of the existing Rajdhani with push-and-pull technology, in which locomotives are attached to the front and rear. Trials have shown a saving of almost 105 minutes. The system can be adopted after the report for Mathura-Pulwa section arrives. Central Railway has started running the third Rajdhani (CSMT-Hazrat Nizamuddin) with this technology.

The committee's inquiry revealed that between 2010 and 2015, there were 963 registered children's homes in the state. These homes belong to the state government but are run by NGOs. Of these, 213 were shut in 2016 after the authorities found that the names of over 74,000 children were fake. In 2017, three more children's homes were shut by the state women and child development department, taking the total to 216. The action was taken after the state adopted a policy of rechecks and new registrations of children with biometric impression, Aadhar card number and personal identification. Most irregularities were found during the rechecks. Three of the homes that were derecognized were from Mumbai and the suburban district, while half -- 107 - were located in Beed, Nanded, Osmanabad, Latur and Parbhani in Marathwada. The rest were in Solapur, Satara, Pune, Ahmednagar and Nashik. The government not only stopped grants but also instructed the administrators of these homes to shift the children enrolled there to children's homes elsewhere. Atul Bhatkhalkar, a member of the PAC for the women and child development department, demanded that a thorough inquiry be conducted by a special investigation team (SIT) into the matter. \"After the inquiry, the culprits should be punished,\" Bhatkhalkar said.

Mishra was in an aggregator cab and was headed home to be with his seven-month-old baby early on Monday when the accident took place. An SUV, which was steered by a teenager, Sudhanshu Saboo, rammed into Mishra's cab in Goregaon (Et). Saboo (19) was later arrested by the Aarey police. A medical test has revealed that Saboo was driving under the influence of alcohol. Also, the police have said that Saboo did not have a driving licence. Mishra was a trader in stocks and a financial advisor based out of Andheri. His wife, Priti, said the family's only wish is that Saboo should remain behind bars and not get out on bail. \"Shailesh had served in the merchant navy for six years and sailed in the high sea as a navigating officer. He then did his MBA at Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur,\" a relative said. He was pursuing a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) course currently. \"Shailesh used to spend close to 15 hours with his books. We were waiting for his exam to end so that he could spend some time with the baby,\" said Priti. Mishra's exam for CFA level two was on Saturday. On Sunday, he was supposed to spend the entire day sleeping. However, his childhood friends decided to meet up in Kandivli and watch the India-Pakistan cricket match together. \"He was not supposed to go as the plan had been called off once. But he eventually went. After the match, his friends urged him to stay back for the night. But he insisted that our daughter would not sleep without him,\" Priti added. Around 1.15am, Saboo's SUV hit the left side of the cab where Mishra was seated. \"Our relatives have seen the CCTV footage and Saboo was clearly at fault. My husband suffered severe injuries while Saboo got away unhurt. The cab driver too is in a stable condition. We will apply for a copy of the CCTV footage; it needs to be presented in court so that Saboo does not get bail,\" said Priti. The couple had been married for four years and their baby turned seven months old on Wednesday. \"We would celebrate her birthday every month. Shailesh obsessed over her.

Community leaders termed the move an \"election gimmick\" as \"the government is offering sops while avoiding demands\". The OBC communities are upset with the government as they feel the 16% quota granted to Marathas could eat into their share of reservation. Also, the Dhangars, who are part of OBC at present, have a grouse with the state as it has been mum on their demand to be included in Scheduled Tribes (ST) category. \"This is all an election gimmick,\" said Prakash Shendge, former MLA and Dhangar community leader, adding, \"We do not want money, but reservation.\" The BJP had assured the Dhangars ST status during the 2014 assembly election campaign.

A division bench of the chief justice and justice Nitin Jamdar was hearing public interest litigations challenging the alleged lack of approvals, including environmental clearances for the south coastal road that is part of the Mumbai coastal road project. At the close of the day\u2019s hearings, the CJ predicted a bleak future \u201cif we don\u2019t care about the environment.\u201d The chief justice passed a notepad to lawyers in the case with a caricature of a human being of the future affected with deformities as a result of pollution. The caricature resembled an alien being with an overgrown head due to high activity of brain cells, an elongated nose because of nasal chambers breathing in toxic and polluted air and small eyes which were a fallout of constant exposure to the computer screen. The being also had long arms due to computer use and short legs because of lack of movement and physical activity. The judge said the lack of concern for the environment will \u201caffect future generations.\u201d The bench is presently hearing arguments in the PILs against the work, including reclamation activities on the coast that started last year on the 10-km-long SCR. This is part of the 34-km-long coastal road that will finally connect Marine Lines to Kandivli. One of the major issues raised by the petitioners is lack of environmental clearance from the union ministry of environment and forests for the SCR. The BMC and state have claimed environmental clearance is not required. The authorities have cited the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) approvals to support their case. Senior advocate Janak Dwarakadas, counsel for the petitioners, said the environmental clearance had additional requirements and conditions that were not there for CRZ approvals.

It put the city ahead of Bogota, Lima, Delhi, and others as the most congested city on its TomTom Traffic Index 2018. In comparison, a New Yorker spends 36% more time on the roads during peak hours. So, why did things come to such a pass and will it get any better?

He said a sizeable number of people had responded positively to such an amnesty scheme last year. It may be recalled that several flat owners in housing societies who have bought or sold their apartments must pay penalties for a delay in stamp duty payment. In Mumbai alone, 7,000 property owners have aired their desire to pay penalty under this amnesty scheme. Also, lakhs of housing societies are to get ownership of land under the conveyance deed scheme. Stamp duty is charged at a standard 5% across Maharashtra and an additional 1% as surcharge for Mumbai property buyers. While the stamp duty is payable as per that year\u2019s rate, the mounting penalty over it will get largely waived. Around Rs 5,000 crore duty and fees are reportedly pending across the state with Rs 500 crore in Mumbai city alone. \u201cEven if we get 10% of it, it will be a big addition,\u201d said an senior official at the office of stamp duty and registration. Cooperatives expert Ramesh Prabhu welcomed the move and appealed to members to benefit from the scheme by producing original documents and proof of making payment. He said this time, perhaps due to poor publicity, the response to the scheme is not very enthusiastic. In 2018, the assembly had approved an increase of 1% to the stamp duty on conveyance deeds in rural and peri-urban areas. Moreover, the stamp duty on conveyance deeds in gram panchayat areas is now set at four per cent of the land value in the amendment, up from the three per cent. The stamp duty in peri-urban areas governed by municipal councils was also increased to 5% from 4%.

The BMC will also tow away vehicles of repeat offenders. Civic commissioner Praveen Pardeshi has asked ward officials to implement the rule from July 7.  The civic chief was initially firm on imposing a flat Rs 10,000 penalty but fearing a public outcry over the substantial penalty amount, decided to grade it from Rs 1,000 to 10,000. The fine will be imposed in the form of an e-challan. Sources said the fine amount will be levied depending on the vehicle size and the location of the area or the road where a vehicle is illegally parked. Ward officials have been asked to appoint contractors to implement the rule in their respective areas. They have imposed a condition that the contractors must compulsorily have a former military person in their staff to enforce the penalty rule. Currently, the BMC does not fine motorists for illegal parking; they are disciplined by traffic police. The BMC will soon hold a meeting with joint commissioner of police (traffic) Madhukar Pande to discuss details of the move.  Pardeshi said, \"We will not compromise on public spaces. We removed illegal encroachments by the poor for nullah widening work (at Bandra). Similarly, we will remove cars of the rich that are parked illegally by encroaching on public property. We are implementing the rule wherever there is a pay-and-park alternative available within a distance of a kilometre and on arterial roads.\" Pardeshi said car owners encroach on BMC roads like slum dwellers illegally occupy public spaces. He said, \"Car owners encroach on roads by parking their vehicles and barring others from using that portion of public land. So, action will be taken against such encroachers.\" Activists have slammed the move and said the civic body must instead create more parking space for vehicles. Activist Ashok Pandit said, \"This is dictatorship. Did the BMC speak to citizens, NGOs and experts before taking such a decision? They are here to serve the people but take decisions without taking citizens into confidence. There are other ways to find a solution instead of harassing citizens.\" The BMC has 146 pay-and-park lots in different parts of the city where around 30,000 cars can be parked along with 4,000 bikes. The civic body insists that people park in parking lots and not on roads which causes serious problems for pedestrians and leads to traffic congestion. In tbe past, the city has witnessed several instances where fire vehicles have faced difficulties reaching a site due to illegally park vehicles. The BMC will use the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act's sections 314 for encroachment and 381 for nuisance to implement the rule. It will bring in a policy listing penalty details and amounts for illegal parking. The BMC has already put up boards in no-parking zones, saying it will have zero tolerance towards illegal parking on arterial roads and impose fines. Ward officers have also been asked to hire machines to tow away wrongly parked vehicles. King's Circle resident Nikhi Desai (67) said, \"The BMC must first provide enough alternatives for parking, construct underground and mult-storey parking at railway stations.

Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

Medical services were hit as patients had to wait longer before they could see a doctor. Ram Pawar said that his nephew, Rupesh, who had been suffering fits and was unable to speak for a few days, waited for quite some time before a doctor attended to him. \"We have come from Versova for an MRI. We can't afford to go to a big hospital. Now we're waiting for someone to look at him,\" Pawar said. Shabana Shaikh said her mother, Noor Jehan, had high blood pressure along with shortness of breath and coughing. \"We've been here for two-three hours but she hasn't been admitted yet,\" she said. The doctors cited poor water quality in their living quarters as the primary reason for the strike.\"We've been having water that smells like sewage. There are residents who work in the operating theatre without taking a bath or washing their hands and are in danger of contracting diseases such as gastroenteritis,\" a rsident doctor said. Another resident doctor said there is no water from midnight till 8.30 am. \"The problem has been there since more than 30 days, yet the administration's attitude is callous,\" the resident said. One junior doctor said the contaminated water was also used in the mess and canteen, where it could be consumed by patients and other doctors. A hospital official said all emergency, casualty and ICU patients were receiving care from the on-call doctors. The resident doctors said they had informed the dean and medical superintendent of their intention to strike in advance. \"Arrangements have been made to provide mineral water cans,\" an official said.

But some principals were sceptical about the move. \u201cWe are willing to help the government but the solution isn\u2019t a permanent one. The government needs to think about the evaluation pattern for the next year,\u201d said the principal of a south Mumbai college. Senior officials said they have shortlisted the top 50 colleges where the cut-offs in the second merit list last year were above 80%, indicating high popularity. \u201cTo ensure SSC topscorers have an equal chance as their CBSE and ICSE peers at such colleges, we met their principals on Monday and proposed the seat increase,\u201d said Suvarna Kharat, joint secretary of the school education department. Last year, as only 2.3 lakh students applied for 3 lakh seats, 72,000 remained vacant in Mumbai. The education department has identified 19 and 21 such colleges in Pune and Nagpur, respectively, and will increase their seats by 10% in all streams. Principals of these colleges are divided on the decision. \u201cThe increase can be accommodated at our college. It would mean taking in 10 students in addition to the existing 120,\u201d said Parag Thakkar, principal, H R College, Churchgate. Some other colleges, however, have infrastructural constraints. A vice-principal of a popular junior college in the western suburbs said: \u201cTo accommodate 120 students, we already seat them four per bench, and there is no more space in the classroom. With attendance being strict at our college, it is near impossible to take in extra students.\u201d Another junior college in the west hasn\u2019t increased their seats in the past 20 years due to lack of space. The principal of a top college in the city pointed out another key issue. Even if the increase is only for the current academic year, it will affect the college for the next few years. \u201cCurrently, the number of our in-house HSC students is equal to the seats available in the bachelor\u2019s course. Only a few of them don\u2019t seek admission and we are left with a handful of seats for outsiders. When this batch comes to first year degree college, we might have a problem. Some principals have also raised concerns if this doesn\u2019t remain a one-time increase. Our infrastructure cannot bear the burden,\u201d said the principal. Shelar said this won\u2019t be a precedent and will not be applicable in the following years. The minister also said students who did not clear SSC must take advantage of the reexamination in July.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Earlier this month, an altercation broke out between a commander and a flight purser when the former did not get the tea he had ordered. The incident took place on board Air India Dubai-Chennai flight AI-906 on June 2. \u201cThe passengers had boarded and cabin crew were busy with pre-departure procedures when the commander called the flight purser and asked for a cup of tea to be served before the flight was to depart,\u201d said a source. \u201cHowever, there was no hot water and so the purser couldn\u2019t brew the beverage. He went to inform the commander but the matter ended in an ugly manner with an altercation between the commander and the purser,\u201d the source added. \u201cThe captain physically pushed the purser in full view of passengers on board,\u201d the source added. The flight departed around 30 minutes late around 12am. A comment from Air India was awaited at the time of going to press. Earlier this week, another such altercation had broken out between cockpit and cabin crew in Bengaluru when an Air India captain who had brought a tiffin box from home ordered a flight purser to rinse it after he had his meal.

Dhananjay Munde, leader of the opposition in the legislative council, said since BJP had won the Lok Sabha elections with an unprecedented mandate, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis was expected to initiate measures to provide relief to farmers and the youth and take more efforts to halt farmer suicides. But the budgetary provisions, said Munde, have established that the entire exercise is directionless. \u201cIn the past four years, no steps have been taken to tackle the agrarian crisis and provide job opportunities to the youth. We expected a complete loan waiver for farmers. The CM is also silent on providing reservation for the Dhangar community,\u201d said Munde. Munde further said the economic survey presented on Monday followed by the budget on Tuesday shows lack of vision and political will to tackle basic issues before the state. \u201cThe finance minister failed to mention the much publicized Shivaji memorial in his budget speech. There is nothing concrete for the working class and farmers,\u201d said Munde. State Congress president Ashok Chavan, too, called the budget directionless. \u201cThe revenue deficit has been increasing steadily, from Rs 15,000 crore last year to Rs 20,292 crore now.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Bombay high court confirmed the death sentence in September 2012, and the verdict was upheld by Supreme Court in May 2015.

PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

But Mankhurd's green spaces lie mostly in inaccessible mangroves. Residents of Pali Hill, on the other hand, are surrounded by trees and can walk to gardens.  This critical difference between quantity and accessibility of green spaces is captured in an IIT Bombay study, the first of its kind to analyse the distribution of green spaces in Mumbai across socio-economic strata, and which has significant implications for urban planning. For the study, doctoral student V Sathyakumar and professors Raaj Ramsankaran and Ronita Bardhan used satellite imagery and census data to compare the quantity and quality of green spaces in the city's 88 census wards or sections to their socio-economic status, calculated using indicators like household assets.  Their findings: Unlike in many Western cities, there was no significant relationship between an area's socio-economic status and its quantity of green space in Mumbai. Both rich and poor neighbourhoods could be scarce in greenery. However, more prosperous areas had better quality and more accessible green spaces, the study showed. Quality was measured by the number and size of green spaces and accessibility by the geographical distribution of those spaces. Planners usually use per capita norms in planning open or green spaces for the city. India's urban development ministry recently recommended 10 square metres per person. In the case of Mankhurd (census section 80), the area ranks very low on socio-economic criteria but was found to have a high 32.7 sq m of green space per capita. By comparison, upscale Khar and Pali Hill had just 11.9 sq m per person. However, Pali Hill (census section 44) scored higher on accessibility with green patches spread across the neighbourhood. Some areas had particularly low per capita green space. The densely-populated neighbourhoods of Chakala, Khara Talao, Bhuleshwar, Kumbharwada, Tardeo, Mandvi, and Girgaum were found to have less than 2 sq m green space per person. Meanwhile, \"most suburban neighbourhoods were found to have less access to quality green spaces like parks, though they are in the vicinity of natural green spaces like mangroves, hills and the Sanjay Gandhi National Park,\" said Bardhan, who heads IIT Bombay's sustainable design group. The findings \"call for overall greening of Mumbai, with focus on developing more parks in low [income] neighbourhoods,\" said Ramsankaran, an associate professor of civil engineering. They also suggest more detailed guidelines are needed for planning, added Satyakumar. \"Quantity alone may not mean much,\" he said. For instance, he notes, the Sanjay Gandhi National Park is a massive green space but not easily accessible to most Mumbaikars. \"If the same 10,000 hectares of forest were distributed in the form of a thousand parks of 10 ha size each across the city, more Mumbaikars will live in proximity to green spaces,\" said Satyakumar. Does this mean that it is better to have many small parks than one large one? Not necessarily; both are important. Sanjay Gandhi National Park provides biodiversity and ecosystem services -- including cleaning and cooling the air -- on a scale that small parks cannot match. The fact that the study found no meaningful correlation between the prosperity of an area and the quantity of its green space was surprising, since most studies from Europe and American cities show that poorer neighbourhoods have fewer parks and gardens. \"We expected affluent neighbourhoods in Mumbai to be more verdant than the deprived neighbourhoods,\" said Bardhan, adding, \"The real estate industry monetizes the green spaces, hence higher association with affluent neighbourhoods.\" Unplanned growth may be one reason that Mumbai bucks the trend, researchers said. Scientists said the study, which was published in the journal GIScience and Remote Sensing, had several limitations that would have to be addressed in future work. Finer resolution of satellite imagery would pick up smaller green patches, for one. The finest resolution used in the study was 5m. Importantly, satellite mapping also does not distinguish between public and private spaces, noted Ramsankaran. And using census data has its own limits. \"Census sections are considered to be homogeneous in terms of socio-economic status as census data at finer scales are not available currently,\" he said.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "BJP List 2019 Maharashtra": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/two-sitting-mps-from-state-denied-tickets-in-bjps-list/articleshow/68514735.cms", "description": "AURANGABAD/KOLHAPUR: Sitting MPs Sunil Gaikwad (Latur) and Dilip Gandhi (Ahmednagar) were denied tickets for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in the BJP\u2019s first national list of candidates announced on Thursday. The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination.
