Pawan further said his government would provide six to 10 LPG cylinders free-of-cost to each family every year. and also promised to fill 3 lakh vacancies in the government departments to provide jobs to youth.

The entire city has been dug out in the guise of laying underground drainage scheme and left without repair. How shocking it is to see 30 people dying of diarrhoea in a city like Guntur? Is it not the failure of the state government?

The stigma attached to conditions such as depression or anxiety is all too real in India, leaving sufferers despairing of a way out of the darkness. This is where support networks come in, with the offer of a patient and empathetic ear, and (just maybe) the promise of future emotional well-being. Finally, it seems, there\u2019s a window for those who struggle to see the light. Sakshi Virmani reports Hawkers and peddlers swarm the Georgian colonnades of Connaught Place on a busy Sunday evening. Inside Central Park, a group of 15 youngsters huddle together on the dew-drenched grass, unmindful of ardent lovebirds playing peekaboo around them. The session gets underway with an activity in which members are asked to identify a nearby object, something they can relate to. A bespectacled boy picks a bench, someone else chooses a defunct traffic light. At this Offcause meet-up, each of the 15 is being keenly observed by a psychologist, who is helming the hour-long group therapy. Here, you can speak freely about your fears, anxieties and traumas, and, also, share tips on how to get by. The idea is to get everyone talking, to make sure nobody feels left out, by providing a sheltered space and an environment that\u2019s non-judgemental, accommodative and creative. Offcause, for example, lends a hand by encouraging men and women to talk candidly, or to take part in activity-based therapy (painting, dance, improv comedy). More than a few come to listen, some seek succour in the shape of suggestions, yet others draw strength from fellow participants who have emerged from the shadows. \u201cAcknowledging the stigma is the first step, and getting yourself out of the house is another \u2013 we self-stigmatise ourselves so much,\u201d claims UK-based Jhilmil Breckenridge, a poet, mental-health activist and founder of Bhor Foundation, an initiative devoted to mental health. Indeed, for the thousands whose days seem perpetually gloomy, an hour or so in the right company might help part the clouds to reveal a ray of sunshine.  LISTENING WITHOUT PREJUDICE Initiatives like Offcause offer a support web for the many overwhelmed by mental health concerns, without the patient having to shell out on a therapist (thus, avoiding the unease of a visit to the psychiatrist). Such collectives comprise individuals whose experiences leave them best suited to help others similarly afflicted. \u201cAfter I got out of depression, I realised it really helps to talk to somebody who is going through similar issues, as it gives them hope,\u201d admits Mridul Trehan, who credits counseling received by the Delhi Depression Support Group for his recovery. Ujala, a 29-year-old from Jammu, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and clinical depression. A regular at Offcause meet-ups, Ujala feels that sharing her experiences can be of immense value to fellow sufferers trying to understand the difference between surface and underlying issues. \u201cPersonally, I am seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist for my PTSD and depression, but I love being a part of Offcause \u2014 to help others going through various mental disorders,\u201d she says. \u201cYou cannot categorise mental illness due to some accident or trigger, it depends on genetics and the way some people\u2019s brains are wired. Some incidents have a ripple effect, they keep playing again and again, which is emotionally consuming,\u201d explains Ujala, who doesn\u2019t just recall incidents, she relives them (like the domestic violence she and her mother have been victims of). For Offcause founder Nikita, it was a causal Instagram update on World Mental Health Day last October that proved the spark. \u201cI asked if people had any stories to share anonymously for the Instagram page I wanted to launch, (and) the response was great \u2013 it was surprising to see my closest friends talking about issues they would have never discussed with me on the rare occasions we would meet,\u201d reveals Nikita, who, having left her job just three months earlier, was somewhat at her wit\u2019s end. So, a page was created and the conversations continued. In less than a month, Offcause had its first informal group therapy session. Since then, it has been hosting meet-ups on the third Saturday of every month in Delhi, Gurgaon and Mumbai.  STRIKING THE RIGHT NOTE At an upmarket gastropub in South Delhi, a group of musicians are sharing a laugh over pints of draught beer. They form part of support group Good Vibration, initially launched to discuss problems affecting young musicians, and anybody associated with the industry. Now, anyone can join in, in the monthly meets. Founder Rithika Nayan, a music teacher and certified life coach, commences by talking about anxiety. Soon, the discussion touches on panic attacks, and how best to deal with them. \u201cScream!\u201d suggests one. \u201cTake a nap!\u201d recommends another, a quick-fix that has everyone nodding in unison. \u201cWe millennials are looking for external validation all the time. Blowing things out of proportion in our heads, overthinking and suppressing emotions leads to extreme outbursts. We are never taught how to deal with our emotions intelligently,\u201d explains Rithika to an audience of 12, all absorbed. \u201cKeeping a gratitude journal really helps \u2014 counting the small blessings makes a difference,\u201d she offers. According to a 2015-16 survey by Bangalore-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), 13.7% of India\u2019s general population suffers from a mental ailment. While 150 million Indians are in urgent need of mental health intervention, only 30 million have access to such care. And, according to WHO (World Health Organisation) projections, by 2020 approximately 20% of Indians would be beset by some form of mental illness. Yet, to many in India, mental health still comes with plenty of baggage, and potential loss of face in front of peers. The older generation is reluctant to talk about it and the young think it\u2019s a fad, believes psychologist Dr Ritu Dangwal. She advocates an organised support network. \u201cSupport groups are essentially reassurance and reinforcements, more like stopgap arrangements. The groups need to realise that if a person needs extra help, they must guide them to psychiatrists,\u201d she insists. \u201cIn India, poor people don\u2019t have the bandwidth to access even basic medical care. But it is heartening to know at least the younger generation is reaching out and saying it\u2019s okay to talk about it.\u201d Dr Dangwal does, however, advise caution. \u201cThe tricky part is when everyone starts giving advice. It\u2019s encouraging to have support groups but only to a point \u2014 they can address problems at the surface.\u201d  CARE FOR THE CAREGIVERS On a Saturday afternoon last month, a support group of caregivers assembled to discuss family and relationships at Khoj Studios, in the bylanes of Delhi\u2019s Khirki Extension. The Listening Circles provide solace and support not just for those undergoing mental distress, but also for their caregivers, who could be a spouse, parents or children. This support network is moderated by Namarita Kathait, a commissioning editor with a publishing house, and Jhilmil Breckenridge. \u201cWe wanted to start a support group that is non-hierarchal, and to get people together in a safe space to have a discourse on mental health,\u201d tells Namarita, 25, who inadvertently became a caregiver for her mother when she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. \u201cI was labelled as the sad girl in school because I did not know how to express what I was going through,\u201d she says, speaking for the many who choose to remain silent. For Jhilmil, it\u2019s important that guidance or advice is not pushed against anyone\u2019s wishes. \u201cPeople are already vulnerable, we don\u2019t want to force things like meditation and spirituality on them,\u201d she stresses. The next step, says Namarita, is to build \u2018listening circles\u2019 with those who have attended the sessions, and to create support groups in their own localities, in colleges and hostels, and among the wider community. \u201cOur ethos is very clear \u2013 we are here to listen and we keep it as liberal as possible,\u201d she maintains. \u201cPeople have the right to speak and not speak, to walk in at any point they want.\u201d  YOU\u2019RE NOT ALONE Then there are youngsters striving to cope with parents who have been diagnosed with a mental illness. It\u2019s this bracket that an upcoming support group network is looking to rally around. Behind the group is Divya Dureja, a counseling psychologist, LGBT activist and TEDx speaker. \u201cIf your parent experiences mental illness, it is normal for you to have all kinds of different feelings,\u201d she reasons. \u201cYou might not understand why your parents act the way they do. It might be hard to know how to understand your parent, or what to do for them.\u201d Divya believes volunteer caregivers need to be empowered as a first line of defence. \u201cI\u2019ve been building frameworks of mental health support groups that don\u2019t seem to exist in our country,\u201d she explained. \u201cOver the past year, I\u2019ve interacted with over 400 students, primarily studying psychology, at panels, summits and workshops, and (also) those individuals who are looking for resources that are empowering to their mental health.\u201d For, psychological well-being is as critical for the ones who deliver care as for those who receive it. And sanctuary can also be found online. On It\u2019s Ok To Talk, the young can share their innermost thoughts through blogs, poetry, video stories, artwork, even audio recordings. But not only the young. Among the personal accounts on the website is a 58-year-old Gurgaon man\u2019s cry from the heart: \u2018Today my heart is brimming painfully with hurt feelings and emotions and there is no one here to share these feelings with or to have a shoulder to cry on little\u2026 I have been facing problems linked with depression, schizophrenia and what not since ages now \u2013 and with me all my family too\u2026\u2019 Proof that age doesn\u2019t discriminate against the despondent of spirit. It\u2019s Ok To Talk reaches out via digital, social media and on-ground activities, which could include public talks, arts-based events and youth leadership programmes. \u201cAnyone can share stories, of lived experiences of mental health and well-being, and the same will have a tremendous impact on those who may be struggling themselves, and help them realise that they are not alone,\u201d informs Sweta Pal, a member of the Delhi team. \u201cBy sharing your own story, you can help inspire other young people that mental health does not need to be shrouded in silence, and it\u2019s ok to talk about it.\u201d Happily, it is becoming easier to talk about mental health, aided by get-togethers that are informal and intimate. And while the fragmented nature of the space means there will always be patients who slip through the cracks, still folks are turning to a growing number of support networks, offering as these do more than a glimmer of hope to the unmoored, the lonely and the vulnerable of India.

TOI reported about the case on Tuesday. Police have registered a complaint under IPC sections 354A (sexual harassment) and 506 (criminal intimidation). According to ACP crime, Shamsher Singh, the woman, who is yet to file a written complaint, has been requested to record a statement. \u201cWe have registered a complaint against an unidentified man and we are currently trying to identify and locate the accused. We are looking at the CCTV feed from the spot,\u201d said Singh. On Friday night, the woman was allegedly harassed by a man in his 20s when she was walking towards the exit at the Huda City Centre metro station. She told TOI that the man stood in front of her and masturbated, and when she confronted him and slapped him, he screamed at her. She further said no one had come to her rescue. The woman had written to Gurugram Police on Facebook Messenger on Friday itself with details of the incident. However, when she did not get a response till Monday, she took to Twitter to share her ordeal. She also reached out to DMRC and identified the accused in the CCTV feeds provided by them on Sunday. \u201cI want to file a complaint and pursue this case because it is time we start speaking about the need for safe spaces for women,\u201d she told TOI. \u201cBut at the same time, I am scared about my own safety.\u201d Police\u2019s delayed response has only made those apprehensions worse. The woman is originally a resident of Delhi but moved to Gurugram as she works there.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

However, with two flyovers being recently developed at these intersections, the need for traffic lights raises a question over the administration\u2019s planning at the initial stage. At Hero Honda Chowk, an underpass and a flyover, built at a cost of Rs 138 crore, have eased problems for long-route traffic. \u201cThe traffic is smooth while going to or coming from Manesar, but taking a turn towards Sector 10 under the flyover is still cumbersome due to merging vehicles and non-availability of signals,\u201d said Aman Chawla, a city resident. Traffic experts say while the underpass and the flyover have helped in reducing congestion, there are still issues at Hero Honda Chowk due to the movement of vehicles in multiple directions. \u201cAs per my understanding, the traffic lights are being installed to streamline the traffic at the junction, which still sees some haphazard movement,\u201d said Sewa Ram of School of Planning and Architecture. The situation is worst at MDI Chowk. According to MCG sources, the original plan was to build a flyover for traffic coming from Atul Katria Chowk and going towards Signature Towers. However, the plan was later tweaked and the flyover was instead built for the traffic coming from Sukhrali and going towards Atul Kataria Chowk. The last-minute changes at the junction have made the situation worse, causing the need for a traffic signal at the junction. \u201cA study showed that maximum traffic flows from Atul Kataria Chowk towards Signature Towers. This is because a large number of people from Old Gurugram coming towards New Gurugram use Atul Kataria Chowk and MDI Chowk. That was the reason why it was decided to build the flyover in that direction but later on, on the instruction of some bureaucrats, the direction was changed,\u201d said a senior MCG official.

The state government introduced prepaid smart meters, on the lines of prepaid mobile phones, in view of the hefty outstanding of the electricity department on consumers and to streamline consumption of power. A smart meter costs Rs 6,000, which would be provided free of cost to the consumers, said an official. Kapur said the department has bought 10 lakh smart meters for the four districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Panchkula and Panipat, and the work to install these meters have already started. \"After installation of these meters, line loss of power would decrease and consumers would be able to get power on prepaid and postpaid basis. Then people would be able to recharge their meters according to their requirement,\" he said. The CMD said that the process for calling a tender to purchase 15 lakh meters for the next phase has been initiated and Jind would be covered in that phase. Last year, Jind district was the biggest defaulter of power bills worth Rs 1,500 crore, of which Rs 1,000 crore has now been settled under the government scheme and Rs 500 crore is yet to be recovered from this district. Once the smart meters are installed, there would be no issue of pending bills, as the department would get the payment in advance. As per current practice, the bills are generated after two months and it takes another month to recover the billed amount. Pending bills are a huge issue for the department. Talking to TOI, V P Thakral, the XEN monitoring Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), said that an amount of Rs 3,400 crore is outstanding on the consumers of 12 districts of the state and around Rs 2,500 crore should be pending of the Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, which covers 10 districts. \"After installing these meters, the bill outstanding issue would vanished completely, as it would be disconnected if not recharged in advance,\" he said. The new concept would work on the lines of a prepaid mobile phone, as one would require to recharge to avail the facility and the department would not need to send an employee for taking meter readings, he noted.

Emerald Estate residents have been complaining to MCG for months that encroachers were setting up illegal shops on the green belt in their neighbourhood \u2014 where they have been planting trees to increase green cover \u2014 eating away the green belt and compromising the safety and security of hundreds of families living in condominiums on the stretch.

Among the farmers who suffer due to non-availability of water at tail end are those from Meham Chaubishi's Nindana, Khattar's native village. While the Meham Minor canal was flowing in full glory on June 16 when this correspondent visited the spot, farmers in villages of Tetri, Kheri and Nindana were using diesal-run tubewell to irrigate their land as the canal by side of their field was lying dry.

But the reality for farmers like us remains unchanged. The situation is only turning from bad to worse,\" Kumar added.

The case was registered on the complaint of Ritik\u2019s father Rajnish Batra, who suspects that his son was murdered. Ritik belonged to Karnal and was a first-year student of B.Tech at the NIT-Kurukshetra. In the FIR, Rajnish Batra said, \u201cRitik was living in Room No. 123 of Hostel No. 1 of the NIT- Kurukshetra and I talked to him last on May 20, at around 10 pm. After an hour, my wife received a call on her mobile from someone to inform that Ritik had fallen from third floor. We rushed to Kurukshetra but on the way were informed that he was being taken to a private hospital in Karnal and we reached there.\u201d After some time, in an unconscious condition, Ritik was brought to the hospital in Karnal by his roommate Shivam and warden DK, he stated. On May 21, he shifted his son to a private hospital in Gurugram for better treatment, where he succumbed to his injuries on May 29 at around 7 pm. \u201cOn May 30, policemen from Third Gate police post in Kurukshetra reached Gurugram, who told us that they had inquired into the matter and found that Ritik died after slipping from the third floor of Hostel No. 10. My son\u2019s mobile, bag, purse, ATM and Aadhaar card are missing. My son lived in Hostel No. 1 but the incident is reported to be from Hostel No. 10. So far, the police have not obtained the call details of my son\u2019s mobile, neither have they obtained the CCTV footage from Hostel No. 10. I suspect that my son has been murdered,\u201d his FIR read. Talking to TOI, Rajnish Batra said, \u201cIn the post-mortem report, the doctors disclosed the cause of death due to internal injuries in chest and spine. But, Ritik did not have any external injury which is impossible if someone falls from the third floor. I visited the spot in the hostel where he had fallen, but found no sign of blood or any such mark there. I suspect my son was murdered.\u201d Following this complaint, on June 17, the Kurukshetra University (KU) police station registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to start the investigation. KU SHO Balwan Singh said, \u201cWe have registered a case on the statement of Ritik\u2019s father and it is being investigated. Earlier in the police inquiry, it was found that he had died after falling from the third floor of the hostel but now his father has raised a suspicion about the cause of his son\u2019s death and the case is being investigated accordingly now.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "time": "2019-06-20 05:51:00", "datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/murder-case-filed-a-month-after-nit-students-death/articleshow/69866315.cms"}, "Chronic congestion: Gurugram has 22 pain points": {"time": "2019-06-18 13:59:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/chronic-congestion-gurgaon-has-22-pain-points/articleshow/69833418.cms", "description": "GURUGRAM: Traffic police have identified 22 spots in the city as chronic congestion-prone areas, based on traffic records for the months of April and May. In the past two months, 381 instances of traffic congestion have been reported from these areas, revealed the cumulative data compiled by the department. That includes 197 instances of traffic jams from the 22 spots in April, and 184 instances from 15 areas in May. Closer analysis of the data reveals most instances of traffic congestion have been reported from seven spots, namely, Sirhaul toll plaza, Signature Towers, Sheetla Mata mandir road, Ghata mod, Atlas FoB, Daultabad flyover and Tikri cut, which accounted for about 60% of the total number of jams. Of these, Sirhual toll recorded the maximum number of congestions, 47, followed closely by Signature Towers with 43 and 33 at Ghata mod. The data also reveals that duration of these jams range from 1.5 minutes to 5 hours. The longest congestion for the two months was in Sirhaul toll. The spot witnessed a 5-hour-long jam in April, as well as a two-hour-long jam in May. Following Sirhaul in the list, Atlas FoB and Ghata mod recorded long jams of about 50 minutes to an hour each. Commenting on Sirhaul, DCP (traffic) Himanshu Garg told TOI, \u201cSirhaul is the most challenging area due to a huge bottleneck. About 21 lanes on the Gurugram side converge into 4 lanes on the Delhi side, leading to heavy congestion.\u201d He added that the data reports and subsequent inspections of the area by senior officials, including himself, has helped address a lot of challenges, like fixing of a sharp turn at Dwarka link road. Gurugram\u2019s vulnerability to perennial traffic snarls is one thing that unites all denizens of Millennium City, which is otherwise is a city of contradictions. Be it commuters from neighbouring cities or residents, the congestion affects all. As a result, traffic cops and their efforts are always under scanner. To find a lasting solution, traffic police resorted to gathering and analysing data earlier this year. The department claimed not only does the exercise help them keep a track on major congestion spots, so that they can deploy force to ease traffic flow, but also help them devise policy and carry out enforcement drives. The department records data daily, which is complied as monthly reports that act as a good reference point for the department. \u201cThrough these reports, we identify priority areas and devise strategy to manage traffic flow, from spots that need deployment of additional forces or barricades, to cuts in the media that need to be opened or closed, etc. Based on these reports, our officials visit key areas to figure root causes of problems. If it\u2019s a structural issue like faulty roads, we speak to the concerned department to resolve the issue,\u201d said Garg.

The project was planned over 235 acres falling under Aravali plantation. The committee rejected the proposal saying the area has dense forest with 16,000 trees and 21,000 plants, and is home to many wild species including black buck (Haryana\u2019s state animal) and sambhar. Sources in the ministry said the project was turned down because of two factors. \u201cFirst, Haryana already has very low forest cover \u2014 at 3.59% of its geographical area. Second, Manethi has dense forest with over 16,000 fully-grown trees and is home to many wild species,\u201d said an official, requesting anonymity. Even though the district administration proposed to divert land to the forest department in Masani barrage, so that non-forest activity could be carried out in Manethi, the committee turned down the proposal and suggested the state government should look for alternatives. \u201cDestroying existing, dense forest at Manethi and carrying out fresh plantation at Masani barrage will not only be destructive for the environment, but also will not be cost effective. We\u2019ve suggested the government should look for an alternative site. In fact, Masani barrage could be a good option to build the healthcare facility,\u201d said the official. Calling it a violation of the Supreme Court judgement, former forest conservator R P Balwan told TOI, \u201cThe proposal was bound to be rejected. In the case of T N Godavarman Thirumulpad vs Union of India, the Supreme Court clearly said \u2018forest\u2019 must be understood according to its \u2018dictionary meaning\u2019. In many other orders, the same was reiterated by the Apex court. The Aravali plantation, therefore, is clearly deemed forest. Authorities should have applied their mind before proposing a project on forest land. There is a large chunk of land owned by panchayats in the state. Establishing AIIMS is certainly important, but it can easily be planned on panchayat or private land.\u201d Talking about the importance of the Manethi forest, renowned forester and former principal chief conservator of forests (Rajasthan) R N Mehrotra, said, \u201cManethi has dense forest which is home to many wild species. Most importantly, the globally threatened White-naped Tit (parus nuchalis) is found here. Also, the Aravali foothills have huge ecological importance as it recharges groundwater. There is a need to protect such forests as we are already facing climate emergency.\u201d During 1990s and 2000s, European Union funds were spent to carry out plantation in the Aravalis. Nearly 3.3 crore trees were planted at a cost of Rs 175 crore, over 30,000 hectares across 13 districts that comprise of Aravalis in Haryana. That included district Rewari, where plantation was carried out on 412 hectare in Manethi.

Apart from making the city open-defecation free, MCG officials also stressed on segregation of garbage and monitoring of waste generators. They also discussed how to process the accumulated garbage at the existing site in Bandhwari. All sanitation officials were advised to spread awareness on waste segregation in all colonies and plotted societies. \u201cThe door-to-door garbage collection programme, registering informal waste pickers, ban of single-use plastic, new waste processing facility, remediation of existing dump sites, are some of the prerequisites to gain Swachh Survekshan points, so we\u2019re concentrating on waste collection and processing.

He is also the founder of Gramin Healthcare, a startup that, since 2016, has endeavoured to make quality healthcare accessible to the rural population. \u201cRural India still requires a medical practitioner to be physically present there \u2014 digital might be a good backup but healthcare delivery requires brick-and-mortar,\u201d maintains Khandheria.  Switching domains I still hold equity in a few telecom companies, in Singapore, Dubai, India, etc., but I decided to go with a startup in healthcare. The first part of that startup was to provide consulting to Tier-2 hospitals and re-engineer them so they could increase their effectiveness. The idea was a replica of what Genpact does \u2014 increase the value and then take a share of the increment. But we realised it was very difficult to collect from the promoter in private hospitals. Then we decided to diversify and build orthopaedic and cardiac practices in hospitals in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities that did not have this service, which was actually not very scalable. From there we morphed into (providing) a second opinion for surgery patients online. Again, that was not scalable because everyone wanted to speak to the same (famous) doctor who could take only that many calls.  Dilemma & solution Some three year ago, a former colleague had joined IFFCO and told me about some horrible debt-trap stories due to hospital bills that drive a number of farmers/labourers to suicide. So, we decided to open brick-and-mortar clinics. IFFCO at that time was setting up IFFCO Bazar\u2019s showrooms in villages by providing guidance to farmers on fertilisers, seeds and crops. But farmers kept demanding from IFFCO that we want healthcare and education. So it was decided that we set up a clinic with IFFCO Bazar. We started off with a partnership but after a few months, they realised the outcomes were good so they agreed to make us shareholders.  Partners in rural health Now we are by far the largest primary-care provider in rural India but we are probably less than 0.1% of the market, so there is a lot more that needs to be done. I hope other people learn from what we are doing because four-five new players will allow us to address 25% of the population over five years. We are also implementing Ayushman Bharat in Maharashtra and Haryana. Currently, we are spread in seven states but working with the Haryana government has been our best experience \u2014 they are very aggressive people, interested in doing good work, and very supportive.  Work/life: Finding the balance I actually do not work like an entrepreneur; I give more importance to family than work. Each year for the last eight years, I have spent 60 days straight with my kids. I learn a lot from my kids and I hope they learn something from me. Besides, I follow every sport on Planet Earth. I play golf and another sport which is not considered a sport by some \u2014 poker.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing.

There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

Yadav, who was the forest minister during the Congress regime, said he had been saying AIIMS can\u2019t be set up on the land in Manethi village as it falls in the forest area, and now the forest advisory committee (FAC) of ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF & CC) has denied environmental clearance to the project. However, when contacted, Inderjit Singh said the matter is under consideration with the Centre. \u201cWe are working on it. The issue of land for AIIMS in Rewari will be sorted out soon,\u201d he said. During the Lok Sabha election campaign, Inderjit had promised to set up AIIMS in Rewari. A source in the chief minister\u2019s office said Manohar Lal Khattar had in 2015 announced setting up of AIIMS in Manethi village of Rewari. However, when nothing happened till 2018, villagers went on an indefinite strike which lasted for 127 days. Before the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP government in the state had cleared the project worth Rs 1,299 crore in a cabinet meeting. It also earmarked 200-acre land with the help of the panchayat. Speaking to TOI, Yadav said the BJP MP should resign on moral grounds as he has played with the sentiments of people of south Haryana. \u201cEven the former finance minister of the country had announced that funds have been passed for AIIMS. But it turned out to be another \u2018jumla\u2019 before the elections,\u201d he said.

The volume of traffic can be gauged from the presence of two of the city\u2019s main metro stations here \u2014 MG Road and Sikanderpur \u2014 used daily by lakhs of officegoers from the city and its NCR neighbours. The administration has made many commitments in the past towards maintaining and beautifying the stretch. Last year, many master roads in the city, including MG Road, were transferred to GMDA. In December 2018, the department had announced that it would conduct repair and maintenance work on 12 stretches by March. However, TOI\u2019s visit revealed that six months later, MG Road is still in a bad shape. Apart from the poor condition of the surface, chronic traffic jams during peak office hours, often due to wrong-side driving that broken dividers and illegal parking seem to encourage, make commute a harrowing experience on this road. Commenting on the GMDA\u2019s efforts to address the challenges posed by this stretch, an official revealed the department is rolling out a Rs 11-crore project to upgrade it. \u201cThe tender has been allotted to a private firm that will repair this stretch \u2014 from Mehrauli-Gurugram Road to IFFCO Chowk, via Sikanderpur road \u2014 by layering bitumen all over.

The library \u2013 free, open to all, and stocking a wide variety of books \u2013 presents a safe learning space for those who do not have access to literature. It has 1,100 members, of which 600 are active. Shubha, a staff member here, calls this their library movement. \u201cOnce other citizens realise the importance of libraries, there will be more of them, and we are demonstrating it through our models,\u201d she tells TOI. So, there\u2019s Manisha, 11, who, recalls Shubha, would initially flip through books and admire illustrations. A year later, she has finished the Hindi translations of six of the Harry Potter series. And Kajal, who trains in a parlour before visiting the library. She wants to become a librarian when she grows up. Mohsin, 16, is another promising child, who yearns to be a cop when he\u2019s old enough \u2013 and, also, be useful around the library on his free Sundays. \u201cI used to while away my summer holidays but now I feel I am learning more geography and history,\u201d shares an eager Mohsin, whose mother works as a domestic help. Tech doesn\u2019t have the touchAt a time when millennials and kids are plugged into their smartphones and tablets, the space for libraries, both intellectually and physically, is shrinking. But seeing the success of Treasure Trove, you wouldn\u2019t think so. Recently, this quaint library, tucked into a basement of a daycare centre to the south of Gurugram, completed nine years. Quirky quotes and colourful posters welcome you to a paradise for the young bibliophile, which has hosted storytelling sessions with popular children\u2019s writer Jeeva Raghunath (who pioneered the storytelling movement in Tamil Nadu) and South African storyteller Bongiswa Kotta Ramushwana. \u201cWhen we moved from Bangalore to Gurugram 10 years back, there was no children\u2019s library here. My daughter loved reading books and my son loved solving jigsaw puzzles. I would buy books but they would finish it in a day or two \u2013 that is when I conceived the idea of a library,\u201d says founder Arvinda Bhatia. \u201cYou can order books online but there are so many new authors who are not read because they are not suggested online \u2013 that is where we come into the picture, (by) suggesting you explore a new book,\u201d she adds. Bhatia remembers a seven-year-old Akshat Gupta, who would cram even the smallest details and conversations while reading at Treasure Trove. He would go on to write seven books in a span of three years. Akshat\u2019s works are given pride of place at the library where he started reading. You can bond with a bookAcross the road is another school library, also accessible to everyone, which houses an eclectic collection for kids between the ages of two and 12 (from \u2018Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People\u2019s Ears\u2019 by Oliver Jeffers to Julia Donaldson\u2019s \u2018The Gruffalo\u2019). The stock at Bookhive, running since 2014, consists of titles the husband-wife duo of Ajay and Ashima Chawla would handpick from their travels. Both developed a love of reading and storytelling because of their son (now in college). \u201cKindle, iPad or any digital media cannot replace the actual touch and feel of a book,\u201d Ashima insists. \u201cIt\u2019s not just having a collection of books but having the right kind of books \u2013 Oliver Jeffers\u2019 \u2018The Day the Crayons Quit\u2019 happens to be the favourite among children of 3-4 years of age,\u201d she reveals, mentioning, proudly, that her most devoted readers are the class-I and class-II children who have finished more than 200 books. The pair recommends other reads by figuring out the interests of their young members. \u201cThe level of customisation is missing when one browses books online from sponsored suggestions \u2013 for instance, how many of us knew the \u2018Queen of Pop\u2019 Madonna is also a children\u2019s book writer?\u201d asks Ajay, pertinently. Yet, even online libraries like Bookpal and Iloveread have their patrons, because of the convenience they offer. \u201cSince everything is far off in the city, and there\u2019s a lack of good bookstores, parents prefer home delivery of books to introduce their children to the joy of reading,\u201d says Shefali Malhotra of Iloveread, adding, \u201cWe are happy to send extra books for parents too.\u201d These volunteers, then, are ensuring that at a time when webpages dominate, the charm of the printed word doesn\u2019t fade among Generation Next. And it is libraries that are pushing back against the tech tide.

The centre, which will be thrown open on Wednesday noon, will have a woman attendant to look after children up to seven years of age.

Cops said the accused is an expert at uprooting ATMs using a pick-up van, taking it to an isolated place and cutting them open with a gas cutter to retrieve the cash. With his arrest, six members \u2014 Advani, Amjad, Amitabh, Zullu, Istak and now Irshad \u2014 of the seven-man gang have now been put behind bars, and cops said they expect ATM theft cases in the city to come down. Of the 33 cases of ATM theft, loot and snatching against Irshad, 29 are registered at different police stations in Gurugram. Police had announced a Rs 50,000 reward for his arrest. According to police, Shahid Polo is the only gang member at large, that he is on the run and that they are hoping to arrest him soon. The gang has executed a series of ATM thefts in Gurugram and adjoining areas between 2012 and 2018. All members are from Kharkhari village in Mewat, and they have a record of attacking police on several occasions, whenever cops tried to arrest them from their homes. Irshad was arrested by police in connection with an ATM theft in Wazirabad. The case was registered at Sector 53 police station on May 7, and handed over to crime unit of Sector 31. Acting on information, police arrested Irshad from Sohna on Monday. He was produced before court on Tuesday and sent to five-day police custody. \u201cHe has been in jail thrice before, and was declared a \u201cproclaimed offender\u201d by court in three cases,\u201d said ACP (crime) Shamsher Singh, adding they are hoping to extract more information during Irshad\u2019s interrogation. The gang specialises in ATM thefts, targeting unmanned ATMs in Gurugram. Police said they used to come to Gurugram in a stolen pick-up van after dark. On reaching their pre-decided target, they would tie the ATM machine with a belt fixed to the pickup van and uproot the machine. They would then load it on the van and drive to an isolated spot, where they would cut open the machine with gas cutter, steal the cash and dump the machine in a lake or pond.

A young woman arrives at Huda City Centre metro station in a Yellow Line train from Delhi and begins walking down, towards the exit. She reaches the escalator that takes people to the station compound. A secure place, seemingly, with CCTV surveillance, and enough people around to make anyone feel safe. But while she is on the escalator, she gets the feeling of being followed. Then she feels a presence just behind her. It gives her the creeps. On Monday afternoon, after a weekend spent poring through CCTV footage, seething at the police\u2019s lack of initiative, and grappling with the question whether to continue staying on in Gurugram or not, the 29-year-old woman decided she would let the world know what had happened at the metro station. On the escalator on Friday night, she had instinctively turned around. It was around 9.25pm.  There were others too, but right in front of her, stood a man, a stranger. He was masturbating. And he was looking at her.\u201cI confronted him and slapped him,\u201d she told TOI on Monday, adding the man, who seemed to be in his mid-20s, responded with a volley of abuses. She said she also screamed to draw fellow commuters\u2019 attention but no one reacted. \u201cNo one came forward, not even the women standing near me,\u201d she said, emphasising the need for discussions and measures to increase safety in public spaces, particularly for women. \u201cWe do not need free rides. We need safety. We want safety, which every government has failed to provide despite multiple promises,\u201d she wrote in her tweet. \u201cI sent the same message to DMRC and I immediately got a call from them, following which I was asked to identify the man on CCTV footage (which she did). \u201cGurugram police got in touch with me only after my tweets,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to file a complaint and pursue this case because it is time we start speaking about the need for safe spaces for women,\u201d she added. \u201cBut at the same time, I am scared about my own safety.\u201d Police\u2019s delayed response has only made those apprehensions worse. A Gurugram police spokesperson said they would start an investigation. \u201cWe received a complaint through Twitter. We have asked her to submit a written application and record her statement on Monday, following which we will start the investigation,\u201d said police spokesperson Subhash Boken. This is the second episode of perverted behaviour to be reported in the last 10 days from a metro train or station compound. Last week, an auto driver was arrested for flashing a woman inside a train between Sikanderpur and MG Road metro stations.

From 147 juveniles who faced trial for criminal activities in 2013, the number has shot up to 209 in 2018. In 2019 (till March), 46 juveniles have been booked and apprehended for their involvement in crimes. A police officer said juveniles mostly start with petty crimes like theft and snatching. With time, they graduate to heinous offences like rape and murder. Criminal gangs nurture juveniles and use them to execute crimes as they face lenient punishments under the Juvenile Justice Act, with a maximum punishment of three years in a correction home. According to the data received via an RTI query filed by activist Aseem Takyar, from 147 cases against juveniles in 2013, the number rose to 175 in 2014, and remained almost the same in 2015. Over the next two years, the numbers even dipped to 159 in 2016 and 148 in 2017. But in 2018, it again saw a steep rise. A police officer said most of the big criminals have committed crimes at a young age. To support his argument, he said in January this year, Gurugram police had arrested gangster Kaushal\u2019s aide Chand (21), a shooter who had committed eight murders in Gurugram, Rewari and Delhi, with his first murder recorded in 2013 at the age of 16. At the age of 19, he had played a key role in the murder of rival gangster Mahesh \u2018Attack\u2019 in Gurugram 2016. Police said in the \u2018Attack\u2019 murder, Chand was accompanied by Sanjeet Vidroh, who was killed in an encounter by Delhi Police in Chhattarpur in 2018. Vidroh was also 16-years-old in 2016 when he took part in Attack\u2019s murder. At 17, he was involved in the murder of liquor baron Manish Gujjar, brother of gangster Binder Gujjar and rival of gangster Sandeep Gadoli, who had by then been killed by Gurugram police in a hotel in Mumbai\u2019s Andheri on July 6, 2016. \u201cThese are some incidents in which juveniles committed heinous crimes and went on to become big criminals,\u201d said the police officer, adding that gangs catch them young and train them to become contract killers. In most cases, they start with petty crimes like snatching and theft, and graduate to heinous crimes. Elaborating further, he said teenagers are generally more aggressive and easily manipulated, and don\u2019t come under police radar. In case they are caught, the punishment is lenient. Even for heinous offences like rape or murder, the maximum sentence a juvenile gets is three years in a correction home. ACP (crime) Shamsher Singh on Monday said they had arrested two teenagers in connection with the murder of a trader in Sadar Bazar. \u201cDuring interrogation, they revealed they were inspired by older gangsters and wanted to emulate them. They picked up the gun to make their mark,\u201d said Singh. A professor of sociology at Delhi School of Economics, Sunil Babu, said besides the juvenile, parents, friends and teachers are all responsible in some way or another for such developments. \u201cStudies have shown that incidents of juvenile crime have increased due to lower social, economic or psychological backgrounds. In cases where juveniles from even well-to-do families venture into crime, their families are the prime reason,\u201d said Babu, adding that it\u2019s important to keep talking to teenagers and monitor their friends and associates.

The senior town planner (STP) of Gurugram has recommended the cancellation of the occupation certificate (OC) of the mall to the director of DTCP following a complaint filed at the CM\u2019s Window. If this happens, this will be first time the OC of such a big and operational commercial building is cancelled in Gurugram.

Taking cognisance of the complaint, the DTCP director had directed the Gurugram STP to submit a report after investigating the allegations. STP Sudhir Chouhan, DTP (planning) RS Batth and DTP (enforcement) Ved Prakash Shehrawat inspected the mall and submitted their report last week. It highlighted that several violations of building plan were found at the mall and recommended that the OC be cancelled till the developer restores the mall as per the approved building plan. Till the unauthorised construction was removed, the report recommended sealing the mall. \u201cDuring the inspection, we found several violations. We\u2019ve sent our report to the DTCP director with the recommended for cancellation of OC of the mall and multiplex. The no-objection certificate (NOC) of multiplex has been revoked. The director will take the final call on the issue,\u201d Chouhan said. During the inspection, it was found that no approval had been granted for the construction of a multiplex on the third floor of the mall in the original building plan. According to the report, Ardee has violated the approved building plan and made illegal and unauthorised construction \u2014 a store room in the lower basement and a fan room and store room in the upper basement. Moreover, changes had been made in the plan on the lower ground, upper ground, ground, first and second floors. The report further mentioned that the developer is still making additional construction and is a continuous offender by neither abiding by the rules of the department nor maintaining the sanctity of the approved building plan. The mall\u2019s building plan was approved in 2012, and it became functional a few months ago.

It is alleged that he also forcibly erased the room booking entry in the register of the hotel with a pen. After the incident, the hotel operators held a meeting and then complained to the superintendent of police (SP) of Sirsa, following which the SP ordered to transfer Jai Bhagwan from Rori police station to Sirsa police lines and also ordered a departmental inquiry against him. DSP Aaryan Chaudhary, who is investigating the case, confirmed that he would start a probe against the Olympian boxer and said that he had been removed from the post of Rori police station SHO and shifted to the police lines.

She is not the only one. Across the city, 65 people who had reported losing their mobile phones last year, had their phones tracked down and recovered by police from as far as UP, Bihar, West Bengal and other parts of the country, after months of effort using latest technological tools.  The recovered phones include all leading brands, from iPhone and Samsung to Oppo, OnePlus and Xiaomi. According to police, the total retail value of the recovered phones is around Rs 10 lakh. This was first time when large numbers of phones were traced and returned to owners. Not surprisingly, the owners were overwhelmed to find out that cops had such a service. \u201cMy husband and I had never thought we\u2019d find the phone again. It\u2019s great to get it back.

Elaborating on why police took so much effort to track phones, the police chief said though mobile phones are small items, owners treat them as treasures.  \u201cToday, mobile phones carry all kind of data, including banking details and passwords, personal photographs, videos and even secrets,\u201d said Akil.

Singh was on an inspection round to take stock of the city\u2019s monsoon preparedness. Earlier this month, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri had directed NHAI and GMDA officials to expedite work on desilting and cleaning drains and roads of garbage, among others, to avoid waterlogging. He directed that special attention be paid to critical points like Signature Towers crossing, Hero Honda Chowk, Subhash Chowk and U-turn near Ambience mall. On the other hand, a visit to several spots aross the city by TOI belied these efforts. Clogged drains, garbage accumulated along the roadside and potholes were visible in many areas. Sectors 34, 37 and 10A, Sheetla Mata Mandir road and areas in and around Hero Honda Chowk are some areas susceptible to flooding even during light showers. Residents of these areas complained of clogged drains, garbage littered everywhere, and construction and demolition waste dumped openly on the roadside. They expressed concerns over the administration\u2019s efforts in ensuring that potholes are repaired, drains are cleaned and garbage is picked up and properly disposed of. \u201cGarbage dumped in the area isn\u2019t managed on time here. Construction waste is dumped along the road and lies unaddressed. Every year, this garbage flows to the drains and chokes them during rains and causes waterlogging.

Residents are also worried that with the expansion of Badshapur drain still incomplete and some drains broken due to construction work on Sohna road, the upcoming monsoon might cause heavy waterlogging.  District administration officials, however, said they have assured the chief minister that the widening of Badshapur drain will be completed by June 30. Speaking on their efforts to contain waterlogging and ensure smooth traffic flow on roads, an NHAI official claimed, \u201cAll the departments are coordinating with each other to mitigate this challenge. NHAI has already cleaned several surface drains, and the remaining will be cleaned in the coming days. We\u2019ve also doubled the capacity of the suction pumps installed at Hero Honda Chowk to deal with waterlogging.\u201d The official added that while the department is doing its bit, people too need to be more careful about dumping waste. \u201cAreas falling in wards 24 and 27 are bit of a problem. Haphazard waste dumping is rampant in these areas, which puts pressure on the administration. Area councillors should also rise up to the occasion and counsel people towards better waste disposal practices,\u201d he said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Caught on cam: Late for class, students brutally thrashed by teacher in Jammu & Kashmir's Doda": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//videos/news/caught-on-cam-late-for-class-students-brutally-thrashed-by-teacher-in-jammu-kashmirs-doda/videoshow/69868312.cms", "description": ""}, "Team India Jersey": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/icc-world-cup-2019-men-in-blue-to-go-orange-against-england/articleshow/69868037.cms", "description": ""}, "Bipasha Basu": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/wife-bipasha-basu-posted-a-meme-on-hubby-karan-singh-grover-and-we-cant-stop-laughing/videoshow/69856115.cms", "description": ""}, "Bus stop space encroached on": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/bus-stop-space-encroached/articleshow/62061707.cms", "description": ""}, "OJEE Result 2019": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/ojee-2019-results-odisha-joint-entrance-examination-results-announced/articleshow/69857920.cms", "description": ""}, "World Cup: Pakistani man misbehaves with Saif Ali Khan at stadium": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//videos/entertainment/hindi/world-cup-pakistani-man-tries-to-misbehave-with-saif-ali-khan-fans-back-on-social-media/videoshow/69859837.cms", "description": ""}, "SA vs NZ Live Score": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/live-blog/live-cricket-score-south-africa-vs-new-zealand-icc-world-cup-2019/liveblog/69855455.cms", "description": ""}, "Gurugram: Four cops booked for escape of prisoner": {"description": "GURUGRAM: A day after a Bhondsi jail inmate escaped from Civil hospital in Sector 10, the police department has booked four of its officers, who were posted at the hospital, when the accused fled.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

He also alleged involvement of Rohtak Municipal Corporation officials and Haryana cooperative minister Manish Grover. Addressing a press conference here, Batra said that the project in Rohtak was given to three companies -- Richa Industries Ltd, Richa Krishna Constructions Pvt Ltd and IND Solutions Pvt Ltd. \u201cBut these companies do not fulfil the eligibility criteria,\u201d he claimed. \u201cAccording to rules, a company which can be given tender should meet three conditions: it should be at least five years\u2019 old, its turnover by March 31, 2018 should have been Rs 20 crore and its net worth should be Rs 5 crore. Two of the companies do not fulfil the norms and the third company has been facing insolvency process,\u201d he told the media. \u201cIf any company is undergoing the process of insolvency, it can\u2019t be given a government project. But here, it was awarded tender for construction by throwing rules out of window,\u201d Batra alleged. \u201cThis project has been leased for 99 years with the upfront premium of Rs 2.7 crore and annual lease price of Rs 2,24,112. The project, including 997-square meter (1,300 sq yards) land, commercial basement of four floors and cafeteria area on the top floor, has an estimated cost of Rs 17 crore. By spending Rs 19.70 crore, there is a plan for the companies to earn approximately Rs 130 crore by selling the commercial area,\u201d Batra alleged. He alleged that the land was sold in a planned manner to Richa Krishna Constructions, which was registered just a day before the start of the process of tender bid. Batra demanded that the tender be cancelled without any delay so that the government money could be saved.

Under this pilot scheme, the government initially kept the target of diversifying 50,000 hectares of paddy in particular selected blocks of seven districts including Ambala, Jind, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Sonipat, and Yamunanagar and kept June 15 as the last date of registration for farmers. But after noticing the scheme received a lukewarm response up to June 15, from the particularly selected areas, the agriculture department extended the scheme for entire areas in the above-mentioned seven districts along with extending the date up to June 24. Now, since the area has been extended, the agriculture officials claim that their registration targets of covering 50,000 hectares under maize will be completed within the allotted period of time. The farmers who are registering under this scheme want the government to fulfill its promise and procure the production of maize, soybean and arhar on the minimum support price (MSP). Pardeep Meel, Kurukshetra deputy director agriculture (DDA) said, \u201cwe were given a target of registering 7,000 hectares of land under crop diversification scheme, and till June 18, we have registered around 7,200 hectares of land and the figure will jump up till the last date.\u201d Dr Girish Nagpal, Ambala DDA said, \u201cwe have a target of covering 8,000 hectares and till date 4,556 hectares have been registered under crop diversification.\u201d Surender Singh Yadav, Yamunanagar DDA said, \u201cOur target is covering 3,000 hectares as the rainfall graph of the district is higher as compared to other areas and we have a large flood-prone agricultural area along the banks of Yamuna river. Till date, 950 hectares of area under diversification is registered.\u201d Farmers\u2019 leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said, \u201ctransparency of any scheme is a must, every scheme is adopted first by the farmers, but its success rate depends if the government fulfills the promises made under it. There are many crops in Rabi and Kharif seasons that require less water like masur dal, mustard, chickpeas, soybean, bajra and other cereals but the difficulty is that the farmers do not get MSP on these crops and there is no guarantee of procurement by government agencies. The government must give a guarantee of the procurement and increase the MSP if they want to promote crop diversification and also invest budget in rainwater harvesting and strengthen the infrastructure to store water getting wasted in seasonal rivers.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "'Batti Gul Meter Chalu': All you need to know about the Shahid Kapoor-Shraddha Kapoor starrer": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/batti-gul-meter-chalu-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-shahid-kapoor-shraddha-kapoor-starrer/photo-yami-gautam-looks-absolutely-ravishing-in-a-black-dress/photostory/65791732.cms", "description": ""}, "Karnataka: Stunt goes wrong, man addicted to Tik Tok lost balance during jumping": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//videos/city/bengaluru/karnataka-stunt-goes-wrong-man-addicted-to-tik-tok-lost-balance-during-jumping/videoshow/69858872.cms", "description": ""}, "Salman Khan": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/salman-khans-90-degree-leg-stretch-leaves-fans-amazed/videoshow/69868102.cms", "description": ""}, "Four caught on camera moving body, booked for murder": {"description": "KARNAL: The police have booked four persons allegedly for killing a youth in Karnal, after they were seen moving the body of 25-year-old Sahil in a CCTV footage.

Despite repeated complaints to MCG, no action has been taken yet, they claimed. \u201cThe Sector 23 market road has been in a shambles for several months now, and its condition is deteriorating day by day. We have been complaining to the MCG, but they have not taken any action so far,\u201d said Pankaj Sharma, a resident. \u201cApart from posing the risk of accidents, potholes also damage vehicles and lead to a rise in dust pollution. MCG should repair this road at the earliest, because later on, they will come up with the excuse that the inclement weather isn\u2019t allowing them to conduct repair work,\u201d he added. Residents blamed shoddy infrastructural work by government agencies. \u201cThe problem areas in our sector are in and around the market. This is mainly because different government agencies dug up the road at different places for laying pipes, cables and other work, and didn\u2019t repair them afterwards.

People are facing difficulty in commuting, and come monsoon, the problem will be aggravated,\u201d said Bhawani Shankar Tripathy, another resident.

Once the work starts, it will take us around four days to cover the stretch,\u201d a senior MCG official told TOI. Meanwhile, residents of Palam Vihar too complained that roads in the area are riddled with potholes. \u201cMCG officials had come to meet our RWA in the last week of April for a meeting. We had raised this issue and told them that the main roads of the area should be repaired before the monsoon begins, as the condition of roads will worsen after that.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "BJP List 2019 Maharashtra": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/two-sitting-mps-from-state-denied-tickets-in-bjps-list/articleshow/68514735.cms", "description": "AURANGABAD/KOLHAPUR: Sitting MPs Sunil Gaikwad (Latur) and Dilip Gandhi (Ahmednagar) were denied tickets for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in the BJP\u2019s first national list of candidates announced on Thursday.
