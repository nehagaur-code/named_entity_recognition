This is Nath's first meeting with Shah after he became home minister. Nath, who is in Delhi for the first meeting of Niti Ayog under the aegis of new NDA government, arrived at Shah's residence in the evening, said sources in Mantralaya. The two spoke for almost an hour, and women safety was a key part of their discussions. After the meeting, Nath is believed to have sent a letter to Shah, seeking budgetary support of Rs 880 crore to set up a special cell in MP to prevent crimes against women and children.  \"Financial assistance will be required to set up a cell to check crimes against women, procure equipment for investigation, reorganize mounted troops and dog squad, and hire counsellors to deal with cases of crimes against women. This will require technically skilled manpower, patrol vehicles and office buildings,\" Nath has said in the missive.  The new cell will comprise investigating officers, legal advisers, prosecutors and counsellors, apart from DNA laboratories and mobile forensic teams, the CM ha written. \"Crime against women and children is a sensitive issue. The state government is committed to strictly deal with offences against women and children. For this, support from the central government is urgently required,\" says his letter. The meeting between the two stalwarts holds significance after BJP's thumping majority in the recent Lok Sabha election, where Shah - as BJP president - had raised the issues of \"mass transfers and deteriorating law and order\" in Madhya Pradesh in his poll rallies.

Around 17 colonies along Hoshangabad road are dealing with dry tubewells. However, the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) is optimistic that as per predictions, the monsoon will arrive in the next week and bring the much needed relief. According to BMC estimates, Upper Lake water supply can be maintained up to 1,649 feet. \u201cWater would last till June 30. Till then, pumping of water from Upper Lake would continue,\u201d said a BMC official. There have also been glitches in the water supply from Narmada and Kolar due to power outages. BMC would begin its ambitious drive for environmental protection and lake conservation. Under the campaign, Upper Lake's revitalization work would begin along the Bairagarh stretch of the Upper Lake. Clean-up of the catchment area is vital to water flowing into the Upper Lake. The programme was scheduled to begin from Tuesday but has been postponed for a day, according to BMC sources. Meanwhile, the BMC has a new plan to provide water to areas only connected with Upper Lake water supply. The plan was discussed with senior urban development officials. Sources said that alternate day water supply, additional water tankers and other contingencies are being worked out. It is estimated that water supply from Idgah Hills filtration plant could stop pumping water from July 1, if the Upper Lake water level does not increase by then. Around five lakh people get water from the Upper Lake. For the moment, BMC has ruled out restriction on use of water on construction and other sites. Government officials indicate that about 70,000 labourers and others could get adversely impacted in case of restrictions being introduced on water use.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

The court suggested that father being the only natural guardian of the child in the absence of mother was entitled to take a decision as to where his son should stay. Paternal grandparents, Bhramarkant Jha and his wife, residents of Anuppur district in MP, had filed a habeas corpus petition after their grand son and grand daughter, aged eight and six years respectively, were taken away by his maternal grandparents to Saharsa in Bihar after their father allegedly shot dead his wife and wife of his brother at his house in Anuppur.

UAHD principal secretary Sanjay Dubey, in a circular sent to all local bodies and district collectors, has instructed them to take immediate measures to curb dog menace. UAHD now aims to reduce the canine population, promote sterilization and immunization of all dogs within a span of two years. UAHD directive began with a cautionary note, in case some urban bodies go overboard with the move. UAHD has cited Preventions of Cruelty Against Animals Act, 1960 and Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001 and MP Human Rights Commission\u2019s (MPHRC) directives over the issue and the reduction of man-dog conflict. MPHRC has taken note of media reports over deaths due to dog bites in Bhopal. UAHD wants to begin with a dog count in each city. Urban development notice stated that current plan to curb dog menace isn\u2019t sufficient and ineffective and hence it wants all urban bodies to complete sterilization and immunization of dogs within two years after conducting a demographic survey. UAHD wants more dog pounds, kennel shelters within city limits to cater to dogs, which are ill or in need of proper care. In Bhopal, the district administration has already allocated land in four locations. The order focuses on having dog squads matching the population of dogs in a city. The teams should be available and able to reach on the dog bite site within a stipulated time limit. Dog population would also determine the number of vehicles each municipal body would have for the task. The establishment of Animal Birth Control Monitoring Committees at local authority levels in accordance with Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules is indispensable for the success of the program. The constitution of the monitoring committee is provided in Rule 4, and the functions that it is required to perform are provided in Rule 5. Besides, pre-surgical checks, dogs assessed to be incurably ill or mortally wounded shall be dealt with in the manner prescribed in Rule 9 of the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules. Street dogs suspected to be rabid have to be dealt with strictly in the manner prescribed in Rule 10 of the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001. To confirm rabies, the brain sample of every street dog suspected to have died of rabies must be sent to the closest accredited laboratory and a report must be obtained for every death under this category. 24X7 availability and dispensation of rabies injection has also been mandated.

Based on media reports that Mishra\u2019s father Kulmani Mishra had died and yet his son was keeping his \u201clifeless\u201d body in his house, SHRC directed the director general of police (DGP) on February 14, 2019, to find out whether death of Kulmani Mishra was natural or unnatural, whether the body was cremated and if not, what scientific steps were taken by Rajendra Mishra to preserve the body and report back to the commission within three days. The DGP replied on February 18 that the doctors of Bansal Hospital, where Mishra\u2019s father was being treated, declared him dead but Mishra didn\u2019t allow the police to enter his house. Then, the SHRC on February 19, 2019 directed for constitution of two teams of medical expert from allopathy and ayurvedic medicine, which shall visit Mishra\u2019s house with a police officer of the rank not less than superintendent of police (SP) to find out whether Mishra\u2019s father was alive. It was against these directives that Mishra and her mother had moved the high court, describing the same as violative of their right to privacy.The court of Justice Atul Sreedharan, while taking note that there has been no complaint of foul smell emanating from Mishra\u2019s residence and a practitioner in ayurvedic medicine has presented a certificate that he was treating Mishra\u2019s father, said, \u201cEven if SHRC believed that Mishra\u2019s father was no more, it had no business to intrude into his private life using agencies of the state.\u201d \u201cThus, the act of the petitioner No. 2 (Rajendra Mishra), even assuming arguendo that his father is no more and he has kept the human remains in his residential premises, by itself does not become an illegality, warranting intrusive action by the State. A regime, which forbids everything save only those things that are expressly allowed, would be regarded as a bullying power-structure, while a regime which permits everything save only those things that are expressly forbidden, would be counted liberal by contrast. India falls in the latter category being a liberal democracy where a man is permitted to act in any manner he pleases, where such act is not prohibited under the law, irrespective of the fact that his act might be seen as galling by the majority\u201d, said Justice Sreedharan.He further said \u201cThus, the petition succeeds, the impugned direction given by the respondent no. 2 (State Human Rights Commission) to the State is held to be violative of the right to privacy of the Petitioners and thereby violative of the fundamental right to life of the Petitioner as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution.

The children had been taken away by their maternal grandparents to Bihar after the alleged murder of their mother by the father. The court suggested that father being the only natural guardian of the child in the absence of mother was entitled to take a decision as to where his son should stay. Paternal grandparents, Bhramarkant Jha and his wife, residents of Anuppur district in MP, had filed a habeas corpus petition after their grand son and grand daughter, aged eight and six years respectively, were taken away by his maternal grandparents to Sihersa in Bihar after their father allegedly shot dead his wife and wife of his brother at his house in Anuppur. Now, he is in jail under judicial custody. In their habeas corpus petition, Bharamkant and his wife said that their son, Nirmal Jha, is accused of murder of his wife Pooja and wife of his brother, Archana on August 5, 2018. After his arrest, Pooja\u2019s parents, Indra Kumar Jha and Sudha Jha, came down from Bihar and took the children with them. They said that their son wished that the children stayed with their paternal grandparents and prayed the court to handover custody of the children to them.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The court commuted the death penalty to life sentence, but specified that the accused would remain in jail for 30 years. The court held that the case is based on circumstantial evidence and therefore court has to be more cautious and circumspect while awarding death sentence, besides the accused is only 19 years of age and possibility of his reform and rehabilitation can\u2019t be ruled out and the crime is not a \u2018rarest of rare\u2019 crime. \u201cIt is a case of circumstantial evidence in which the principle of prudence applies. In the cases of circumstantial evidence, while awarding sentence of death penalty clinching cogent evidence ought to be looked into with more care and circumspection in exceptional cases otherwise in a case of circumstantial evidence the death penalty may not be prudent\u201d said Justice J K Maheshwari and Justice Anjuli Palo. They said, \u201cIn the present case, the age of the accused is 19 years and the possibility of reformation and rehabilitation of his entire career cannot be shut down. Simultaneously, it is observed here that nothing has come on record as well as in the finding of the trial court as to why the rehabilitation and reformation of the accused is not possible and such observation of the court is based on the hypothesis and without any basis. As per the report received from jail, the behaviour of the accused is prudent and unquestionable, therefore, in our considered opinion, the policy of reformation and rehabilitation cannot be ruled out in the case of accused who is 19 years of age. The observation made by the trial court while recording the finding that the accused may be dangerous to the society is based on presumption and hypothesis, which cannot be accepted without any basis. In this regard the prior and subsequent antecedents of the accused in the jail are relevant, which do not draw any inference in negative side as observed by the trial court.

MP is also apprehensive that following Gujarat\u2019s decision to store water upto 138 meters in the dam, it may face the issue of submergence as large number of project-affected families are still living in the valley awaiting compensation. According to Narmada Water Dispute Tribunal Award (NWDTA) , MP gets 57% of the power from RBPH. During normal monsoon, Gujarat gets 9 million acre feet (MAF) of Narmada water from the dams of Madhya Pradesh. Now that the two states are ruled by two different political parties, it may compound the problems, political observers said. After getting its full quota of water earlier this year, Gujarat had recently demanded more as it wanted to store water in the dam to a height of 138 meters to test its strength, sources in the state government said. However, Madhya Pradesh reasoned that Gujarat\u2019s decision of storing water at 138 meters would lead to submergence of land in the state where thousands of families have already approached the Grievance Redressal Authority (GRA) regarding compensation. More than 6500 people in the valley in 76 villages may face submergence and this human misery should be avoided, MP stated. After Madhya Pradesh refused to discharge \u201cadditional water\u201d, Gujarat stopped generating power in RBPH, sources claimed. Besides 1200 MW power from RBPH, 200 MW power is also generated from canal power house. Now Gujarat has offered about Rs 250 crore to Madhya Pradesh for the loss of about 700 MW of power, sources claimed. Sources said that after Gujarat\u2019s offer of power compensation, the MP government said it wants the neighbouring state to pay an additional Rs 250 as \u201copportunity cost\u201d as it will have to purchase costly power from the market\u201d. Though the two issues are yet to be resolved, Gujarat continues to store water in the dam, while MP is against discharge of any additional water. Now, Gujarat is banking on heavy monsoon rains in the Narmada valley for MP to release water from its dams after flooding. Minister for NVDA Surendra Singh Baghel said, \u201cGujarat wants to create a crisis in MP. But we will ensure that all rights of Madhya Pradesh are safeguarded. All the rights of the people in the Narmada valley, including those of farmers, will be protected.\u201d Meanwhile, Medha Patkar of Narmada Bachchao Andolan (NBA) said, \u201cThere are more than 30,000 people still living in the valley. The GRA has not been able to figure out how many are living presently in the valley.\u201d She said that the state should seek Rs 3600 crore from Gujarat for refusing to give power from RBPH.

Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The Rajya Shiksha Kendra (RSK) has collaborated with an NGO that works for education and designed the curriculum with the help of the tribal welfare department. The curriculum for class 1 and class 2 has been written in local dialects like Bhili, Baigani, Gondi and Korku for students of Bhil, Baiga, Gond and Korku tribes. As part of the pilot project, the curriculum has been implemented only in three districts of the state -- Manda, Dhindori and Khandwa. New Education Group (NEG), an NGO, conducted a survey in different areas of MP to get an idea about the need for the project. They found that in tribal districts, less than 30% students could understand, read and speak Hindi as opposed to 70% who only communicated in their local dialect. \u201cChildren of the tribal areas do not understand Hindi as their mother tongue is different. They only know the local dialects and face difficulty when they are taught in Hindi in schools. Many of them also drop out of school from class 1 and class 2 as they are unable to make sense of what is being taught. Teachers are unable to explain the meaning in their local dialect, making things more difficult. So after developing the curriculum, we also trained the teachers,\u201d said Sandeep Tirkey, program head of NEG. Irene Cynthia J P, director of Rajya Shiksha Kendra, told TOI that the initiative had been taken to make children of tribal districts attend school and understand what is being taught, instead of dropping out. Assessment of the initiative will be done in year 2020 to gauge the impact of the programme and the changes needed. The RSK is all set to start the programme in four other districts -- Harda, Betul, Anoop-pur and Shadol -- from the new academic session. \u201cIf the new initiative makes a difference, we will expand it to more areas in the coming year.

Initially, officials have invited \u2018expressions of interest\u2019 from eligible experts in the field for setting up a storage system of 500MW capacity. The main objective, officials say, is to ensure effective management of surplus power on a day-to-day basis. As of now, available technologies and their viability are being explored, they add. Managing director of the MPPMC, Sukhveer Singh, says: \u201cIt is a normal phenomenon that during off-peak hours (typically evening and night hours) there is an abundance of power, but it cannot not be utilized properly, especially in the case of renewable energy. Thus, if there is a storage capacity, the energy during the off peak hours could be stored and can be used during peak hours. Even in the case of surplus power, if we sell the additional power during off peak hours \u2014 the rates at energy exchange are also lower \u2014 it could be in the financial interest of the company.\u201d \u201cIt is a forward-looking step to ensure effective management of power. However, we are looking into the availability of suitable technologies in the field. It also depends on the proposals. We will evaluate them and take the further call,\u201d he adds.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step.

He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users.

He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said.

In ward 53, Jatkheddi (along Hoshangabad road) Datta instructed officials to clean the drains and remove encroachments. BMC\u2019s focus is on ensuring that that there is no waterlogging. According to BMC estimates, there are about 700 choke points in the state capital. In 2016, the BMC\u2019s preparedness and measures were exposed in heavy rainfall. Besides, the district administration has to focus on over 957-odd structures, which have been deemed dilapidated. Over the years, after heavy rainfall, BMC elected representatives have blamed political influence and how it\u2019s impacting on the civic efforts to clear encroachments and deal with dilapidated structures. Last year, the BMC mayor\u2019s budget speech had listed a page full of names of locations that would benefit from Rs 125 crore stormwater drainage management projects. It comprised areas like Kechi Cholla Nallah, Krishna Nagar, Rajendra Nagar, Khushipura, Dwarka Nagar, Sanjay Nagar (near railway track) besides colonies towards BHEL and Hoshangabad road, which were the worst affected after unprecedented rainfall in June-July 2016. Many of these areas are yet to benefit from the announcement.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

In the same context, the number of footpaths have reduced by 80%, according to traffic experts. ISBT near Habibganj and Nadra bus stand are the major bus stations in the city. All these locations have poor pedestrian walkways. It seems pedestrians have no right of way in the grand scheme of things of various development agencies in the state capital. In the garb of city beautification, the height of central verges and pedestrian walkways are being increased. According to experts, government agencies need to make roads safe and easy for pedestrians. As per Rule 11 of the Rules of the Road Regulations, 1989, pedestrians have the right of way at uncontrolled pedestrian crossings. A case in point is the increase in height of the central verge near Bittan Market. A BMC official, Vinod Shukla, explained that crossing a verge is not legal as per law. \"There are demarcated zebra crossings for proper crossing of road,\" he said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party.

Megha was in Bhopal to attend a function at Bhojpur Club which gave her a lifetime membership of the club. Notably, this year 11 climbers have lost their lives due to heavy traffic during the summit. Talking to TOI, Megha said that it is unfortunate that this year so many people have lost their lives in their attempt to reach the summit. \u201cLike me it is dream of every climber to complete the summit. However, it is disheartening to see that people are losing lives as traffic has increased significantly,\u201d said Megha. Asked for the reason of such a rush, Megha said, \u201cIt is because there is no restriction. Anyone who can pay the fee with even less mountaineering experience can attempt climbing. On the other hand, China not only restricts number of applications but allows only experienced climbers to attempt the summit.\u201d She said that more people are dying because of the lack of proper training. \u201cEven if you have done the certificate course a good climber does lot of training under professional trainers. They put themselves under tough training situation so that they can fight exigencies,\u201d said Megha. She said that despite so many climbers attempting the Mt Everest summit every year the awareness is poor about it. \u201cPeople ask me the height which I touched at the Mt Everest. It is unfortunate that people do not know even the height of the Mt Everest which are available in several school books,\u201d said Megha. She is willing to coach and teach if she gets an offer. \u201cI have achieved what I wanted to. I have touched the highest peak and now my next target is to touch the lowest point of the world. However, if anyone offers me to train I will do it to motivate others,\u201d said Megha. Incidentally, for three days after completing the summit, Sehore's Megha drifted in and out of consciousness, unable to tell anyone back home that she had achieved her dream. Later, she disclosed her journey of completing the summit. Daughter of a farmer in a landlocked state like MP, Megha always dreamt of standing on the top of the world. After a failed attempt last year, at 5am on May 22 this year she stood on the peak of Mt Everest. Megah had to turn back just 700 metres from the summit last year. Undaunted, she decided to try again. But there was another shock in store. \"I had fractured my backbone in three places in a training accident in July last year. But I had promised myself that I will summit within a year, and began training again in November,\" she said. Her determination paid off, and she was elated to reach the summit. Then, her nightmare began. She also felt victim to the 'traffic jam' near the peak that claimed so many lives this year.

He said in the so-called first phase, farmers got benefit up to Rs 15,000 only on their total loan amount. \"Congress has not only fooled the farmers, is also trying to cheat them in the name of PM Kisan Nidhi Yojana.

But this prompted the district authorities across the state to increase the collector guidelines to generate more revenue from the market. Unfortunately, this proved to be detrimental, resulting in a major slump in the sector, said real estate experts.

He said in urban areas, buyers will have to shell out 3% extra fee like before. The state government has encouraged women to invest in property by reducing the registration fee to only Rs 100. \u201cIn case the property rates are more than the current guideline, the transfer fee would be 2.1% of the difference amount. At present, the stamp duty and registration fee on the joint-ownership of wife or daughter is 1per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively. The cabinet has slashed it to Rs 1000 as stamp duty and Rs 100 maximum as registration fee to encourage women empowerment\", said Bhanot. He said in case of partition of family property, the stamp duty has been reduced to 0.5% from the current rate of 2.5%. The stamp duty and registration fee on donation of the property have also been reduced to one per cent with maximum amount of Rs 500 and Rs 100 respectively against the current rate of 2.5% and 0.8%, he said.
