A surprise pick by the ruling BJP-led NDA   , Birla's name was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself for the post, sources said. The 56-year-old leader is considered to be close to both Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah. Birla's nomination for the Lok Sabha Speaker's post also has the   backing of non-NDA parties   such as the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). Starting his political journey as a student leader, Birla was also elected to the Rajasthan Assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. He won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was again elected this year from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. Birla defeated Congress's Ramnarayan Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently-concluded general election. A conscientious parliamentarian, Birla has registered an 86-per cent average attendance in the House, asked 671 questions, participated in 163 debates and introduced six private members' bills in the 16th Lok Sabha. From 1991 to 2003, he was a key leader in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) as a state-level president first and then, as a vice-president at the national level. Birla, who holds a Masters degree in commerce, is a member of the Standing Committee on Energy in Parliament, the Committee on Petitions and the Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. He succeeds eight-time MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Lok Sabha Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this is not the first time that a relative newcomer has occupied the position. In 1996, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader G M C Balayogi, also a two-time MP then, was elected as the Speaker in the Lower House of Parliament. After his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

Having got bogged down for two nights after the Tololing victory on June 13/14, the Indian Army regained the initiative by capturing Rocky Knob and Humps 9 & 10 by 6 pm on June 17. Rocky Knob\u2019s capture went on to serve as the base for the victorious assault three nights later on Point 5140, the highest, dominating feature on the Tololing-Point 5140 ridgeline overlooking the national highway and allowing the enemy\u2019s interdiction of military transport to the Siachen glacier. The battles for Tololing, Tiger Hill, Point 4875 are famous but lesser known are battles such as those for Rocky Knob. But they were vital because they served as stepping stones in the 8 Mountain Division\u2019s strategy to recapture the Drass ridgelines \u201csequentially\u201d. Flushed with the Tololing success, the Army did not want to lose momentum and allow the enemy to consolidate and counter-attack. After Tololing, the feature Humps, which was extending towards the next major target, Point 5140, was captured by 18 Grenadiers. Then, 13 JAK Rifles was tasked to capture Rocky Knob and Humps 9 &10, which were stepping stones extending further to Point 5140. Panchkula-based Lt Gen Amar Aul, who retired as chief of staff, HQs, Western Command at Chandimandir, was then commanding 56 Mountain Brigade at Drass. \u201cThe 13 JAK Rifles got bogged down for two days in trying to capture Rocky Knob via night assaults. I then took a risk with a daytime assault, which is acceptable in an operational environment. The acceptable distance for our troops is 800 m from where the Bofors is going to hit targets. But we moved the troops only 300 m from target zone. Then, we took two Bofors guns to a bridge west of Drass town and next to the ammunition dump. From there, we got a direct line of sight of Rocky Knob. At 3.30 pm, I was there and the Bofors resorted to direct fire mode and lambasted enemy bunkers at Rocky Knob. After that pasting, 13 JAK Rifles (Alpha company under Major S Vijay Bhaskar, Vir Chakra) assaulted Rocky Knob and Humps 9 & 10 and captured them by 6 pm,\u201d Aul told TOI. Bofors fire was devastating for Rocky Knob, says Maj Gen Lakhwinder SinghWithout the accuracy and firepower of the Bofors, the Infantry could never have dreamt of a daytime assault. \u201cThe Drass ridges were bare, our Infantry could not approach the enemy lodged at commanding heights without the overwhelming fire support of the artillery. Assaults were at night because of these factors. The Infantry was very brave in taking frontal assaults but without artillery they could not have achieved success at those high altitudes. For the Rocky Knob firing, the Bofors fire was just devastating. Imagine the devastation the enemy faced: 42 kg Bofors shells delivered on enemy bunkers with a muzzle velocity of more than 2,500 feet per second. After the Bofors firing, the Infantry\u2019s 13 JAK Rifles assaulted and took the features without a casualty,\u201d Maj Gen Lakhwinder Singh, who commanded the 8 Mountain Artillery Brigade during the war, told TOI. That lesser-known battle for Rocky Knob would play a vital role three nights later. \"Our main target was Point 5140 of which Rocky Knob was a kind of base. The significance of Point 5140 was that it was virtually at the LOC, it commanded observation of Tololing and Bhimbet nallahs, Sando Heights, Drass village etc. The control of Point 5140 by the intrusion of the 6 Northern Light Infantry made our troop movement under its observation very hazardous as it was the highest, dominating feature. So, we achieved victory on Point 5140 by surprise and deception. I launched 18 Garhwal Rifles and 1 Naga from the north and west of Point 5140 by 8.30 pm on June 20. The enemy thought the assault was coming from those directions as our troops had concentrated in strength. However, as the enemy got distracted, I got 13 JAK Rifles to sneak in and launch the real assault on Point 5140 at 9 pm in a frontal mode from the base at Rocky Knob. The enemy was completely surprised by the assault from Rocky Knob,\u201d explained Aul.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

In all, 27,000 participants entered the contest, adjudged by a five-member jury.

She said her parents were progressive and always had a positive outlook towards their lives. \u201cMy father Kamaldeep Singh is a college professor and my mother a school principal.

From playing the role of a protagonist in a play woven around the subject of female foeticide to participating in awareness campaigns and street plays, she is still determined to do her best for the cause. She said the award motivated her to use every platform and opportunity possible to propel people to give equal amount of love, care and opportunities to daughters. Sunil Jaglan, sarpanch of Bibipur village in Jind district of Haryana who started this contest, said the contest was held from June 10 to 16 to celebrate successful completion of four years of the \u2018Selfie with Daughter\u2019 intiative to make people feel proud of their daughters and celebrate their birth. He felt that appreciation from Prime Minister Narender Modi, who has mentioned his initiative during his radio show \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019, and his visits to Silicon Valley in the US and Wembley Stadium in the UK encouraged him to take this contest to other dimensions.

The group constituted under the chairmanship of Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Punjab food and civil supplies minister, held its first meeting on Tuesday and discussed delay in verification procedure for smart ration card. It was observed that inordinate delay occurs in verification of beneficiaries due to the performa being passed from the patwari\u2019s office to deputy commissioner. To ease the process, the group suggested that in rural areas, patwaris, block development officers and district food supply controller or his nominee verify the forms of the beneficiaries. In urban areas, inspectors of municipal committees, executive officers and secretary/superintendent level officers and in areas falling under cantonment boards the nominee of the respective deputy commissioner may do the form verification.

Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

These demands included special one-time infrastructure development package for border areas, acquisition of farmers\u2019 land by the Union government beyond the border fence and compensation to the farmers for their land rendered ineffective for farming due to periodic military deployment. It was also submitted in the Niti Aayog meeting held on June 15 that the state government, in the third meeting of the governing council of the Aayog in April 2017, had sought similar tax incentives and promotional schemes for Punjab as was being given to the hill states and north-eastern states. The state government had also urged the Union government for special development and maintenance of the border roads under the national highway programme, but these issues have not been addressed by the Centre till date, officials said. It has been submitted that the border areas of the state had been devoid of mainstream development activities on account of its strategic location, hostile conditions with neighbouring Pakistan, cross-border terrorism, problem of smuggling, crime and insurgency. In chief minister Amarinder Singh\u2019s speech circulated during the Niti Aayog meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it was highlighted that the criteria adopted for allocation of funds \u2014 60% by Centre and 40% by state \u2014 by the Union government under the border area development programme (BADP) started in 1986 does not suit the geographically smaller but thickly populated states like Punjab.

He highlighted since the state police is the second line of defence on the international border after the Border Security Force (BSF), there is a need to improve the police infrastructure for better policing and improvement of internal security. Amarinder has also submitted that since the rapid advancement of technology has led to a change in the pattern of crime, the Punjab intelligence wing has taken initiatives to modernize and technologically upgrade itself. The chief minister said the intelligence wing would require Rs 50.29 crore for the project. It was also submitted that as the state law and order wing has a proposal to modernize field units and equip them with latest technology, a sum of Rs 109.70 crore is required for the project.

This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

That is the strike rate of thieves, succeeding in driving away 269 vehicles in 163 days (till June 13) from the city this year. Their favourite haunts: sectors 34, 36 and 39 and Manimajra - areas that are near Mohali in Punjab and Panchkula in Haryana. If the police are to be believed, drug addicts are behind most of the auto thefts. They steal vehicles to commit snatchings to fulfil their habit, police said. Most of the vehicles were stolen from free parking lots of markets, hospitals and public buildings during daytime. At night, the thieves targeted vehicles outside houses. Out of the stolen vehicles, 217 were two-wheelers, 44 cars and the rest three-wheelers. Police claimed their strictness has prevented the accused from selling stolen vehicles in nearby states like Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. \"Mostly, the buyers are scrap dealer. They dismantle the vehicles and sell the part,\" cops said. However, police have recovered 81 stolen vehicles and arrested 59 auto lifters from different parts of the city so far. Charanjit Singh, DSP (PRO) said police have taken various steps like reshuffling of duty timings after analysing timing of crime to control auto thefts. Under \"Roko-Toko Abhiyan\" suspected persons or vehicles are checked, especially during odd hours. Police also randomly seal particular sectors with maximum force to rule out any possibility of crime. Police have also been taking unlocked vehicles into their possession and are being released after proper verification.

Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

While the UT administration failed to preserve its heritage items, a London-based auction house Phillips once again auctioned three heritage furniture items of city beautiful on June 6. A sofa set designed for the high court and Assembly was auctioned for Rs 34.80 lakh, while a pair of armchair was sold for Rs 69.60 lakh. Besides, an executive desk designed for administrative buildings of Chandigarh went under the hammer for Rs 7.39 lakh. Le Corbusier and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret had designed the aforementioned items. Both used to design chairs, tables, stools, and racks for government offices in the late 1950s. The designed furniture lot was replaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, after which the administration had tossed the items in its backyards and stores. Unaware of the furniture's international worth, most UT departments had auctioned the old furniture thinking it as junk. Meanwhile, activist Ajay Jagga has written to the home minister, Amit Shah and minister for external affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and sought inquiry into the auction of these furniture items. He further requested the authorities to look into the matter and seek a report on the Protection Against Trafficking in Cultural Property, specially of Chandigarh, so that the loopholes can be plugged and a suitable action be taken, after ascertaining the facts. To preserve its heritage artefacts, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had recently asked the UT administration for taking corrective steps. Director general of ASI had advised the administration to prepare an inventory of heritage items with subsequent authentication of their authorship. The ASI had also suggested that a museum dedicated to Le Corbusier and his team can be established by the administration, which will prevent taking these works of art out of India. Heritage furniture goes under the hammer During his stay in Chandigarh, Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret designed several pieces of furniture. Some of the prototypes are present at Government Museum and Art Gallery, Sector 10. Jeanneret used the furniture in the house he stayed in at Sector 5. He was so fond of the city that after his death, his ashes were immersed in Sukhna Lake as he had desired.

The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

Showers drastically decreased their dependence on agriculture pump sets (tubewells) to water their fields during or after transplantation for a couple of days. Battling hot and humid weather for the past several days, the cotton growers too were happy following the rains. The long dry spell proves unfavourable for both the crops. However, more rains can be harmful for cotton and more so when water stagnates at the bottom of the plant, hitting the growth of the crop. The agriculture department officials are also elated over the rains which were long overdue for smooth transplantation of paddy and saving the cotton from long dry spell. \u201cWe were praying for rains to our cotton crop some much-needed relief from very hot and humid weather. But we know that if rains continue for long, it could be harmful for cotton,\u201d said Sangat village farmers Baldev Singh and Hukum Singh. Farmers Mohinder Singh and Mukhtiar Singh at Sivian village said, \u201cWe were ready to transplant paddy and were waiting for our turn to draw water through motors on Monday evening. But with the rain, now we may not need water for a couple of days which will save a lot of electricity.\u201d The paddy transplantation is at full swing since June 13, official date fixed by the state government. Paddy need a lot of water as the fields had to be left full of water. The rain, however, left vegetable growers in a spot of bother. The rains are unfavourable for watermelons, grapes and some other crops and affect their sale.

The ministry has also recommended that the UTs should approach jails, gurdwaras and temples for providing mid-day meal. Further they have also suggested cooking competition among the helpers wherein students would be judges. According to MHRD, temples, gurdwaras and jails can be involved in MDM scheme. \u201cTemples and gurdwaras have greater reach among the community and this can help in wider publicity for midday meal scheme. These religious places can also adopt some schools in their vicinity for providing meals as it would give enhanced sense of ownership of the midday meal scheme among the local community,\u201d the MHRD stated. All cook-cum-helpers as well as interested members of the community can take part in the cooking competition. It will include cooking of pulses/vegetables/different types of chapattis, methods of cooking, food safety issues and hand washing. Two children each from primary and upper primary classes and nutritionists from Home Science College may be selected as judges for the same. The MHRD, in its presentation uploaded online, has recommended that all UTs have school nutrition gardens (SNGs). The move will also help students get safe and organic food with better nutritional value and learn new skills. As per the ministry, SNG is a place where herbs, fruits and vegetables are grown on school premises to be used in the preparation of midday meal. In Chandigarh, some of the schools already have such an area that they call kitchen gardens. TOI had earlier reported how some of the schools in the UT, including GMSSS in Sector 47 and Sector 26, have been growing huge quantities of vegetables. These vegetables were then being used in midday meal kitchen of the schools. Chandigarh was also praised at national level for this initiative. The Union ministry has, however, recommended that this initiative should be undertaken in every government school. The UT administration was also mulling asking all schools to grow veggies for MDM as government schools have huge campus. The initiative will help address malnutrition and micro nutrient deficiencies, will give children first-hand experience with nature and gardening, Large piece of land is not required even roof tops can be used for growing vegetable/fruits in containers, the MHRD has stated. Plants may also be grown in small containers, cans, jars, discarded earthen pots, wooden boxes, ceramic sinks, food tins, and gunny bags in case sufficient land is not available. The MHRD has further recommended that schools can tie up with local departments like Krishi Vigyan Kendras, department of agriculture/ horticulture, Food and Nutrition Board and agriculture universities for collaboration.

They were also directed to pay the claim amount of Rs 48,100 to the complainant. Baaj Mohamad had stated in his complaint that on November 20, 2017, his insured tipper overturned in Phase 3, Mohali, while unloading material from the vehicle. In the process, factory-fitted hydraulic system of the tipper got severely damaged. Following this, the insurance firm was intimated about the loss/ damage to the vehicle. Upon this, a surveyor was appointed by the company to assess the extent of loss/ damage caused to the insured vehicle. The surveyor visited the complainant on November 24, 2017, and gave a go ahead to get the vehicle repaired from the market and told Baaj to get a second-hand hydraulic system fitted for which he would be fully reimbursed by the insurer. The complainant acted accordingly and the repairs incurred a sum of Rs 1.53 lakh, including towing charges to the tune of Rs 8,000. In the meantime, another surveyor appointed by the company visited the complainant and took photographs of the damaged parts of the vehicle and of the insured tipper post repair. Besides collecting a copy of the insurance policy, the surveyor promised full reimbursement against the amount spent. However, on January 4, 2018, the insurer rejected the claim. In its reply, the insurance firm stated that the claim was rightly repudiated as the loss caused to the vehicle was not covered under IMT 47 and 52. The forum after hearing both the parties observed, \u201cIf a vehicle is overturned and damaged, that would be a part of accident and when the accident is covered under the terms and conditions of the policy, overturning could not be excluded from that. If it was to be excluded, there should have been specific mention of the same in the cover note/ policy. In absence of such a mention, the insurance company cannot say that since no premium was paid for overturning, the risk of overturning was not covered.\u201d It was further stated that the insurer or its agents were under obligation to disclose the extra premium for overturning and if the same was not paid, overturning would not be covered. But from the record, it does not appear that this obligation was discharged by the agents of the insurance company and thus the firm cannot claim the benefit of the overturning exclusion clause. \u201cIn view of the above findings, we are of the concerted opinion that the repudiation of claim of the complainant is wholly unjustified and amounts to deficiency in service on the part of the company, which certainly has caused immense, mental and physical harassment to the complainant,\u201d the forum observed.

The report was tabled in a meeting chaired by senior superintendent of police (SSP) to review traffic-related problems in the district. According to the report, 310 people died in 2017 and 290 in 2016 in Mohali. The number of deaths in 2018 was 297. The study found that the months of February, March, April, October and December were relatively more dangerous as regard to fatal accidents. The report was divided into three main aspects \u2014 dealing with general trends of accidents over the past three years along with its various analysis; dealing with the availability of resources within the state and in Mohali along with corresponding road accidents and highway patrol vehicle deployment.

It has submitted that India\u2019s direct tax collection, \u201cwhich is untapped and needs immediate attention, is just 6.15% of the gross domestic product (GDP), which is well below our neighbour China (11.35%), the US (21.99%), the UK (22.86%), Germany (29.15%) and France (32.83%)\u201d. The authorities have not been able to curb tax evasion as in a number of such cases, the offenders, if caught, can get away since the offences are compoundable and the culprits just have to pay the tax demand and penalty along with the interest. Chief minister Amarinder Singh made this suggestion during the fifth meeting of the governing council of the Niti Aayog held in New Delhi on June 15. Although Capt Amarinder could not attend the meeting due to health reasons, his speech was circulated in the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Amarinder submitted that the direct tax reform needed instant attention to ensure that its collection was raised to at least 10%. He reasoned that there was a need for mobilization of financial resources to deal better with multiple challenges like unemployment, inequality and poverty, which require concerted efforts from the Centre and the state governments. \u201cThe introduction of GST, which incidentally faces a number of issues that we hope will get addressed at the earliest, has improved indirect tax revenue to some extent. However, the direct tax front needs immediate attention,\u201d he added. Direct taxes include corporation tax, taxes on income, wealth tax, gift tax, estate duty, interest tax, land revenue, agriculture tax, hotel receipts tax and expenditure tax. The Union finance ministry, in the interim budget for the finance year 2019-20 presented in February, had set the target of direct tax collection to the tune of Rs 13.8 lakh crores. In the last few years, the Union government has not been able to meet its set budget targets of direct tax collection.

It is probably the first instance in recent times that MPs from all parties \u2014 Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal, BJP and Aam Aadmi Party \u2014 preferred to take oath in the state language. Only Deol took his oath in English. While two Union ministers Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Som Parkash had taken their oath in Punjabi on Monday, 10 other MPs followed suit on Tuesday. Linguistic diversity was the flavour of the oath-taking this time as MPs from across India predominantly took oath in their mother tongue, be it Dogri, Kannada or Konkani. Gurdaspur MP Sunny Deol takes the oath of office in EnglishOver a fornight before on May 30, Harsimrat and Som Parkash had taken their ministerial oath in English, but they were trolled by Punjabi netizens. Second-time Jalandhar MP Chaudhary Santokh Singh said it was for the first time that 12 out of 13 MPs had taken oath in Punjabi. Former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra, who was elected to Lok Sabha thrice, said it was after quite some time that such a large number of MPs from Punjab had taken oath in Punjabit. \"It was probably in 1977 that all Punjab MPs, barring one, had taken oath in Punjabi,\" he said. Three-time MP Ravneet Bittu also said that the number this time was maximum. The symbolism of MPs across parties and from diverse communities taking their oath in Punjabi in the Parliament assumes significance for Punjab, where language was made the reason of communal rift in 1950s and 60s and the state witnessed a bitter campaign against Punjabi language. While SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal concluded his oath with Sikh greeting \u201cWaheguru Ji ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh\u201d, Sanguru MP Bhagwant Mann concluded with \u201cInqalab Zindabad\u201d.

In March, LPAI had begun the symbolical construction of the ICP by levelling 50 acres of land, but the work of the first phase couldn\u2019t be started due to delay in awarding the contract. \u201cNow the work has picked up pace and we have begun construction work of passenger terminal building which will have facilities of immigration, customs, bank, rest room, baggage trolleys and basic medical facilities under one roof,\u201d said LPAI manager Sukhdev Singh while talking to TOI on Wednesday, adding that the work of the first phase of 16 acres of ICP would be completed by October 31.

However, after he was evicted from the university hostel in 2017 since he was no longer a student, he was forced to live on footpath in absence of any job or caretaker. He has pitched a tent in front of a temple in Sector 29, and performs his morning ablutions two metres from his sleeping bed, as, he says, he has no one to guide him. Paswan said his mother was no more and his father has been in a psychiatric hospital for past over a decade. He said his siblings had abandoned him and he had no knowledge of their whereabouts. In February, Paswan, through a Good Samaritan, had written a letter to the social welfare and child department of the UT administration to help him provide some assistance in terms of shelter and food. However, the administration took notice of his complaint only recently and passed it on to registrar of PU since the complaint mentioned that Paswan was evicted from PU hostel.

He lived here for around 10 years. He kept taking admissions in courses to stay in hostel but kept failing. There were also multiple complaints from students about Billu's hygiene.

The money people give to me is always stolen. My mobile phone has been stolen three times.

In its submissions during the Niti Aayog meeting on June 15, it was highlighted that the water table is falling in almost 85% area of the state. Out of the total 138 blocks in Punjab, 109 blocks are over-exploited, two critical and five semi-critical, and there is an annual over exploitation of groundwater to the extent of 14.20 billion cubic metre annually. \u201cIt is strongly felt that it would be in national interest that the state gets specific grant of Rs 2,575 crore from 2020-21 to 2024-25 by the 15th finance commission so that projects for modernization of canal systems can be taken up and the declining trend of groundwater level be reversed,\u201d state chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has submitted. He has requested the central government to approve the project of extension, renovation and modernization of canals being fed from Satluj, amounting to over Rs 918 crore, and revamp of various distributaries systems along with Upper Bari Doab Canal at a cost of over Rs 1,112 crore. The state government has cited the latest report by the central ground water board that has indicated that the water in all the three underground natural aquifers in Punjab shall finish in next 20-25 years. Also, the sub surface water in the state is depleting at a rate of more than 50 cm every year. Procurement of maize, pulsesPunjab government has suggested that there is a need to come up with some robust system of the central government sponsored procurement of alternative crops which will also reduce farmers\u2019 dependence on wheat and paddy, and also conserve natural resources. It has been highlighted that the minimum support price (MSP) of crops other than wheat and paddy is also fixed by the central government, but there is no mechanism for procurement of crops like maize, pulses and oilseeds. Therefore, prices of these crops remain subdued in market and farmers have to suffer. Doubling farmers incomeChief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has sought Niti Aayog\u2019s support for preparing a road map to double farmers\u2019 income by 2022 and has said that it must include clear and precise plans specific to the state, crop and agri-climatic conditions. At the same time, the chief minister has sought Prime Minister\u2019s personnel intervention for announcing national debt waiver for farming community including farm labourers. It has also been suggested that the sum of Rs 6,000 per year under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi should be increased to at least Rs 12,000 per year and to also give similar financial assistance to farm workers. Relief for drought situationThough the state government has submitted that Punjab is drought protected due to 100% assured irrigation but in the event of deficient rains whose frequency is increasing, it would need a sum or around Rs 2,000 crore in drought like situation given the specific agro-climatic conditions of state. It has been suggested that the central government should enhance the subsidy on intelligent irrigation techniques from present level of 30% to 70%. At the same time, the central government should also enhance the allocation under Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojna to Punjab to Rs 1,000 crore per annum.

The case was registered on the complaint of Ritik Batra\u2019s father Rajnish Batra who raised suspicions that his son had been murdered. Ritik belonged to Karnal and was studying in first year of Bachelor of Technology (BTech) at the NIT Kurukshetra campus. \u201cRitik was staying in room number 123 of hostel number 1 of the NIT. I talked to him on May 20 at around 10pm. After an hour, my wife received a call on her mobile phone from someone who informed her that Ritik fell from the third floor of the hostel. We rushed towards Kurukshetra, but on the way we were informed that he was being taken to a private hospital in Karnal and we reached there. After some time, my son was brought to the hospital in Karnal by his roommate Shivam and warden DK. On May 21, we shifted him to a private hospital in Gurugram for better treatment, where he succumbed to his injuries on May 29 at around 7pm,\u201d Rajnish stated in his FIR. \u201cOn May 30, policemen from Third Gate police post in Kurukshetra reached Gurugram. They claimed that Ritik died after slipping from the third floor of hostel number 10. My son\u2019s mobile phone, bag, purse, ATM, Aadhar card are missing. My son lived in hostel number 1 but the incident is reported to be from hostel number 10. So far, the police have not obtained the call details of my son\u2019s mobile phone and nor have they obtained the CCTV footage from hostel number 10. I suspect that my son has been murdered,\u201d Rajnish claimed. \u201cIn the post-mortem report the doctors disclosed the cause of death due to internal injuries in chest and spine. Moreover, Ritik did not have any external injury which is impossible if someone falls from the third floor. I visited the spot where he had fallen in the hostel and witnessed no sign of blood or any such marks there. I suspect my son was murdered,\u201d Rajnish said while talking to TOI. Following his complaint on June 17, a case under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was filed at the Kurukshetra University (KU) police station. \u201cWe have registered a case on the statement of Ritik\u2019s father and it is being investigated. Earlier, during the police enquiry, it emerged that he died after falling from the third floor of the hostel but now his father raised suspicions on boy\u2019s death and the case is being investigated accordingly,\u201d said a police officer.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Their contention is that despite the arrest of several persons for allegedly leaking the question paper for selection of naib tehsildars, the commission has not cancelled the examination. The petitioner informed the HC that the exam papers were leaked in Karnal and police were able to nab a whole gang of persons who were involved in supplying the same to a large number of candidates. \u201cWhen the paper was leaked, then the sanctity of the test was itself lost and the HPSC should have cancelled the same and ordered re-examination. It was just one gang that was caught. What about the other or others who were not caught or detected and the persons to whom it was further circulated, as today just a click of button on phone sends the same to thousands,\u201d the petitioners\u2019 counsel Saurabh Dalal submitted to the HC. Dalal also contended that the state machinery and the HPSC were not capable of handling and conducting the exam and even if a single candidate got the answer key to the leaked paper, the future of thousands of other candidates would be at stake on account of unfair means by some. He also submitted that the state and the HPSC should employ fool-proof measures of conducting examinations so that the future of those who have put in years of hard work and dedication is not jeopardized. The petitioners have prayed for cancellation of the examination held on May 26 and re-conduct of the written examination. In July 2015 and May 2018, the HPSC had issued advertisement for the selection of 70 posts of naib tehsildar (Group-B) in revenue and disaster management department, Haryana. The commission conducted the written exam in various districts of Haryana on May 26. The Haryana Police claim to have busted a gang allegedly involved in leaking the examination paper at Rewari on May 26. The paper leak was cracked by Rewari Police and the special task force (STF), Gurgaon, on the basis of secret information.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The common merit list includes the names of all the eligible candidates who have applied for admission to Class XI in science, commerce, skill courses and humanities stream. This list has been prepared in the order of percentage before the tie-break. Tie points will be settled at the time of allotment of school and stream. A stream-wise provisional merit list has also been prepared (before Tie Break) on the basis of first preference given by the candidate. Suppose a candidate has selected the science stream as his first preference, commerce as second and skill courses as the third, his/ her name in the stream-wise list has been included in the first preference list of science stream. However, the actual position may change at the time of allotment of school and stream and thus no inference should be drawn from the said list, officials stated. In the science stream, 3,157 students, 2,243 in commerce and 9,124 in humanities have been considered eligible. The remaining 1,407 students have been stated eligible for different vocational courses. In the sports category, 63 students have been considered eligible, including three compartment students. The UT education department had received 18,575 applications but only 15,931 had completed the process. All of them have been included in the provisional eligibility list. There are total 11,065 seats in 40 government senior secondary schools for three main streams and skill courses. For the candidates who filled more than one registration forms, the first one entered in the system has been considered. The other form(s) have been rejected. While going through the list, the students must double-check the particulars such as name, father\u2019s name, board roll no., date of birth. They must also see if their grades or marks secured in Class X examination have been entered correctly. They should also calculate the merit as per details mentioned on Page 10 of the prospectus and ensure that the school code and stream code have been mentioned correctly. In case of any discrepancies, the candidates will have to report to the grievance redressal cells formed in two schools on June 19 before 2pm. No change in preference of school and stream will be allowed before completion of the first round of counselling, the latest notice reads.

The eligibility of the applicant was recommended by the UT estate office. Besides, another computerized draw was conducted for the two applicants of the Oustees Scheme. Both the applicants got dwelling units in Sector 63. To maintain transparency and fairness, both computerized draws were held in presence of applicants and under the supervision of senior officers of UT administration as independent judges. Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer (CEO), CHB, said draw of the result has been uploaded on the website of CHB (www.chbonline.in). A copy of the result has also been provided on the notice board of the CHB, he added. The administration rehabilitates slum-dwellers after conducting a biometric survey. The colonies resettled in the last ten years include Colony No 5, Nehru Colony, Kuldeep Colony and Mazdoor Colony. The allottees will have to pay Rs 1,000 as licence fee every month for 20 years after which they will pay the balance to get the ownership of the flat. The construction of the flats in Maloya had begun in June 2014 at a cost of Rs 250 crore under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to hand over the flat keys to the allottees in May last year, but couldn\u2019t do so as the project was incomplete. The project, construction which began in 2014, was originally meant to be completed by 2016, but it got delayed by more than two years. Chandigarh Housing Board is the nodal body for the construction of rehabilitation colonies. So far, it has built 12,736 of the total 25,728 flats proposed for slum-dwellers.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The award function will be held on September 7, 2019, Neerja's birthday, at Chandigarh. Wendy Sue Knecht, who is coming down from Los Angeles, specially to preside over the award function will honour Sifiya. Wendy was also employed with Pan Am and was Neerja's trainer. The annual Neerja Bhanot Award was instituted in 1990 in the memory of senior flight purser Neerja Bhanot, who saved several lives while sacrificing her own, during a Pan Am plane hijack at Karachi Airport in September 1986. The corpus of the trust is the insurance money offered to the Bhanot family and a contribution by Pan Am for adding the 'Pan Am' brand name in the title of the trust. The trust does not accept any donations and operates from the interest earned on the corpus. The award consists of Rs. 1.50 lakh in cash, a citation and a trophy. It is conferred on an Indian woman who, when faced with social injustice, overcomes it with guts and grit and then helps other women in social distress. According to Akhil Bhanot, managing trustee of Neerja Bhanot Pan Am Trust, \"Sifiya got married when she was 16 and her studies were stopped. Unfortunately, her husband died when she was 20. She had two children by then. Sifiya wished to continue her studies but did not get any support. Not willing to give up, she took on a part-time job and resumed her studies.

The Congress leader hit out at BJP's strategy of playing the nationalist card. \"We are Congress\u2026 we launched the freedom movement\u2026 gave our blood and sweat\u2026 braved British atrocities \u2026 we don't need any certificate to prove our nationalist feelings especially from the ones who apologised to the British at that time\", asserted Priyanka, urging the workers to go to every household in their area and meet every voter. She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022. And once we come, we will stay here for long on the basis of our hard work,\" she said adding that the hard-workers would be adequately rewarded.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination. His late grandfather, Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, was long associated with the Congress. | Full coverage of Lok Sabha elections in MaharashtraAmong other prominent leaders from Maharashtra in the first list of candidates are Union minister Nitin Gadkari from his hometown Nagpur, state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve from Jalna, Union MoS Hansraj Ahir from Chandrapur and Union MoS for defence Subash Bhamre from Dhule.

Sitting MP from Sangli Sanjay Patil has also been renominated, putting an end to speculation over any change in constituency. Patil\u2019s candidature was opposed by a section of BJP leaders in Sangli. However, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is understood to have called a meeting of local party leaders and resolved the differences.
