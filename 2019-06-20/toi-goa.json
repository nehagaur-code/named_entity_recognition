A surprise pick by the ruling BJP-led NDA   , Birla's name was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself for the post, sources said. The 56-year-old leader is considered to be close to both Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah. Birla's nomination for the Lok Sabha Speaker's post also has the   backing of non-NDA parties   such as the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). Starting his political journey as a student leader, Birla was also elected to the Rajasthan Assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. He won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was again elected this year from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. Birla defeated Congress's Ramnarayan Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently-concluded general election. A conscientious parliamentarian, Birla has registered an 86-per cent average attendance in the House, asked 671 questions, participated in 163 debates and introduced six private members' bills in the 16th Lok Sabha. From 1991 to 2003, he was a key leader in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) as a state-level president first and then, as a vice-president at the national level. Birla, who holds a Masters degree in commerce, is a member of the Standing Committee on Energy in Parliament, the Committee on Petitions and the Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. He succeeds eight-time MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Lok Sabha Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this is not the first time that a relative newcomer has occupied the position. In 1996, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader G M C Balayogi, also a two-time MP then, was elected as the Speaker in the Lower House of Parliament. After his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

As the crisis plunged deeper, Margao Muncipal Council (MMC) was found grappling for solutions. Fomento has refused to accept incoming garbage into Sonsoddo until the \u201creject\u201d accumulated in the plant are disposed by the municipality. Fomento and the MMC were headed for a collision course as the civic body, upon the instructions of the deputy chief minister, Vijai Sardesai, was preparing to file a police complaint against Fomento for obstructing its garbage management exercise. \u201cThey are obstructing our work of clearing the rejects piled up inside the plant,\u201d chief officer of MMC Siddhivinayak Naik told TOI. \u201cOn one hand, they are demanding that we cart away the rejects to make space for incoming waste, and on the other, they are preventing us from lifting the waste by shutting the gates of the plant by 6pm. We had made all arrangements to remove the waste from inside the plant by engaging men and machinery through the night.\u201d While nearly 1,000 tonnes of reject lies inside the plant, sources said MMC managed to clear around 70 tonnes of waste on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough free space to allow daily incoming waste into the plant. The entire volume of reject needs to be moved out before any more waste can be treated,\u201d said Sudin Raiturkar of Fomento, who has been monitoring the situation at Sonsoddo. Sources said that going by rough estimates, it will take a few more days for MMC to clear the plant of all the reject. The MMC, with no other place to dump the reject,has found itself in a piquant situation. Sources said that the recent fire at the Sonsoddo garbage dump led to the current crisis. While the reject from the plant would eventually find its way into the old garbage dump, protests by locals led to Fomento dumping the reject inside the plant until there was no enough space to handle incoming garbage. That was when Fomento blocked entry to MMC\u2019s garbage trucks on Monday. Sardesai, who visited Sonsoddo on Tuesday morning, said that he would ensure that things fall in place soon. He blamed both MMC and Fomento for taking a \u201cbureaucratic approach\u201d to the issue. \u201cGarbage is rotting on the streets, and MMC and Fomento are playing volleyball throwing the ball in each others\u2019 courts. They need to have a hands-on approach. I am not going to tolerate garbage rotting on the streets in my constituency (Fatorda),\u201d Sardesai said. MMC has now begun scouting for open plots of land to be used for segregation of mixed waste before moving it to Sonsoddo. While it has identified a place in Fatorda, councillors from Curtorim and Margao wards have been asked to identify places for the purpose, sources said. \u201cPeople have demanded that only segregated waste should come to Sonsoddo,\u201d Sardesai said. \u201cFomento is also demanding segregated waste. I am also of the same view. But the question is where do we segregate mixed waste. There are black spots in Margao, Cutorim and Fatorda where mixed waste is dumped, which goes to Sonsoddo.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

We had made all arrangements to remove the waste from inside the plant by engaging men and machinery through the night.\" While nearly 1,000 tonnes of reject lies inside the plant, sources said MMC managed to clear around 70 tonnes of waste on Tuesday. \"That's not enough free space to allow daily incoming waste into the plant. The entire volume of reject needs to be moved out before any more waste can be treated,\" said Sudin Raiturkar of Fomento, who has been monitoring the situation at Sonsoddo. Sources said that going by rough estimates, it will take a few more days for MMC to clear the plant of all the reject. The MMC, with no other place to dump the reject,has found itself in a piquant situation. Sources said that the recent fire at the Sonsoddo garbage dump led to the current crisis. While the reject from the plant would eventually find its way into the old garbage dump, protests by locals led to Fomento dumping the reject inside the plant until there was no enough space to handle incoming garbage. That was when Fomento blocked entry to MMC's garbage trucks on Monday. Sardesai, who visited Sonsoddo on Tuesday morning, said that he would ensure that things fall in place soon. He blamed both MMC and Fomento for taking a \"bureaucratic approach\" to the issue. \"Garbage is rotting on the streets, and MMC and Fomento are playing volleyball throwing the ball in each others' courts. They need to have a hands-on approach. I am not going to tolerate garbage rotting on the streets in my constituency (Fatorda),\" Sardesai said.

In many parts of the commercial capital, garbage lay around in overflowing bins and around them, until the MMC began clearing the piles late on Wednesday evening. Waste that is usually collected every morning was only lifted later in the day.  The problem started on Monday, when Fomento, the concessionaire of the solid waste management (SWM) plant, refused to accept incoming waste from MMC trucks for want of space inside the plant to accommodate it. Meanwhile, at Sonsoddo, the MMC has started clearing the waste from inside the shed on a war footing deploying large number of trucks and labourers for the exercise. A number of heavy earthmoving machines were also seen deployed at the site. Sources in the MMC said that while a portion of the shed has been cleared of the rejects accumulated therein, it will take some more days for completely moving rejects out of the shed. \u201cOut of more than 1,000 tonnes of reject accumulated inside the shed, over 20% of it has been cleared,\u201d a source in the MMC said. The reject taken out of the shed are now being dumped onto the existing garbage dump outside the plant. Incidentally, a fire broke out once again at the garbage dump Wednesday evening hampering the garbage-clearing exercise. \u201cSmoke had started billowing from the dump. One fire tender was used to extinguish it,\u201d a fire officer said. Fomento maintained that the entire volume of rejects needs to be moved out before any more waste can be treated at the plant. Meanwhile, in areas like Aquem and Borda where door-to-door collection wasn\u2019t done for three days, residents were left with no option but to dump their waste at convenient spots on nearby streets. People were seen taking their bins and garbage bags on their two-wheelers and dumping them at various spots around the town. By the time MMC began collecting waste on Wednesday, its resources fell woefully short. While some of the trucks were offloaded on the garbage dump outside the plant, several garbage-laden trucks were seen parked elsewhere waiting to be offloaded. \u201cThey didn\u2019t collect our waste for three days,\u201d said a senior citizen from Aquem. \u201cIt began to stink so I asked my neighbour to throw it at the corner of our street.\u201d The MMC gave each household two bins for wet and dry waste in 2015, but most began segregating only four days ago, when municipal workers asked them to do so. Some who began segregating stopped after the workers themselves mixed the waste while collecting it. Former MMC chairperson Savio Coutinho said that councillors have an important role to play. \u201cThey should personally visit households and ask people to segregate garbage,\u201d he said. \u201cCitizens are more likely to listen to their local councillor than the municipal worker who is often not a local and who may not speak the local language fluently.\u201d Even those residents of the town who went shopping weren\u2019t spared the stink. \u201cThe stench was unbearable,\u201d said Julia F from Malbhat, a market-goer. President of the New Market Traders Association, Vinod Shirodkar, alleged that the municipality was regular in collecting waste from hotels and restaurants, but meted out second-class treatment to the market and households. \u201cThe government continues to grant permissions to buildings in the vicinity of Sonsoddo,\u201d he said. \u201cConstruction activity is still on.\u201d MMC\u2019s exercise of scouting for places in Curtorim and Margao to segregate waste before transporting to the Sonsoddo plant continued on Wednesday. It has however, identified a place in Fatorda, sources said. Sonsoddo garbage plant caters to waste generated in Margao, Fatorda and Curtorim. Fomento has now insisted on only segregated waste to be brought at its Sonsoddo plant.

They also alleged that some of the entries for the competition were accepted after the deadline and were awarded for winning the competition instead of being disqualified. \u201cThe organizers of Kala Academy are to blame for all the mess.

Art and culture minister Govind Gaude, who is also Kala Academy chairman, told TOI that Kala Academy has not engaged in any malpractices. \u201cThere is a rivalry between two tiatr groups which is why this issue has occurred.

Beneficiaries will also get subsidy towards vehicle insurance and scholarships for their children, Goa Tourism Development Corporation chairman Dayanand Sopte told reporters here on Wednesday. He also asked the local cabbies to join GoaMiles for a month and experience its functioning. During the past few days, opposition to GoaMiles has grown with some altercations happening between tourist taxi operators and app-based drivers. \u201cThe Goa government has taken a firm decision to stand by the GoaMiles initiative in the interest of tourism in the state. The government will neither buckle down to any sort of pressure from vested interests nor to their demands to stop or scrap the app-based taxi service,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would urge local taxi operators who have not joined the initiative to sign up with GoaMiles, which is completing a year of successful operations this August, instead of standing on the sidelines protesting against it,\u201d Sopte said. The allegations by taxi operators against GoaMiles are baseless and out of sheer ignorance and jealously, as several of their former colleagues are doing extremely well after joiningit, he said. Enlisting the achievements of GoaMiles in the last year, the GTDC chairman said, \u201cOn commissioning the service in August 2018, the fleet has steadily risen from 55 vehicles to 1,400 cabs.\u201d The app-based taxi service which started with 1,500 trips per month touched around 14,000 trips in December 2018 and in June 2019, has recorded more than 20,000 trips per month. \u201cSimilarly, on an average, a taxi driver registered with GoaMiles earns around Rs 3,500 per day without having to lose on commission, which other app-based taxi services operating nationally charge,\u201d Sopte said. This figure is much more than what a non-GoaMiles driver earns in a day and the earning potential is directly proportional to the hard work put in by the driver. He said that GoaMiles is not an \u2018outsider\u2019. \u201cEven other app-based taxi services may not have as much local genes as much as GoaMiles has,\u201d Sopte said.

The directorate of higher education (DHE) decided to take the progress a step further and four government colleges in Goa are readying themselves to introduce smart classrooms. The 62 smart classrooms will not only bring teaching alive, but also connect the four institutes virtually, for resource sharing. Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, has also been roped in by the state to train college teachers on how to develop animation and other content which can make teaching more interesting for students using digital tools. The government colleges in Sakhali, Khandola, Quepem and Margao have been equipped with smart classrooms at a cost of Rs 4 crore. Work on fitting the institutes with the devices began in January-February this year so that the classrooms could be put to use during the current academic year 2019-20. \u201cThe colleges have been provided with smart interactive boards, smart podium and visualiser and interactive pad. One training session for the college\u2019s teachers has already been completed on how to operate the devices. The second training by IIT Bombay will take place in July on how to create animation and different content to make the lessons more gripping,\u201d said a state official. Work on the smart classrooms at Government College, Borda, Margao, and Government College, Sakhali, is already complete and their use will begin with the launch of the scheme at the latter institute by chief minister Pramod Sawant later this month. The smart classrooms will also connect the four colleges virtually, allowing students to take up a programme, not available in their institute, at one of the three other institutes. Students will be able to sit in their own college and attend a lecture at an institute in another part of the state. \u201cWe have provided one virtual board to all colleges which is the standard practice.

Monserrate told TOI that he was open to the idea of the Bainguinim plant being built by either Imagine Panaji Smart City Mission Development Ltd or Goa Waste Management Corporation. \u201cWhoever can do it faster should take it up, but I want that the garbage treatment plant should come up quickly,\u201d Monserrate said as he pointed to the unsegregated waste at the Sonsoddo garbage dump. For decades, Margao municipal council (MMC) has been dumping all kinds of waste at Sonsoddo. The untreated garbage caught fire in May and burned for days, emitting highly toxic gases. With the solid waste treatment facility at Saligao refusing to accept garbage from Panaji and Taleigao for nearly five months due to overloading of its multi-waste sorting plant, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) is on the lookout for its own facility. The Saligao plant now sorts and treats garbage only from Bardez and is being expanded to treat increasing quantities. The proposed expansion was symptomatic of faulty planning, Monserrate said. \u201cWhy build a capacity of just 100 tonne and then go for expansion? When we plan for Bainguinim we should plan for the requirement of more talukas,\u201d he said. The environment impact assessment (EIA) through National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has been completed for the Bainguinim site and a public hearing is likely to be conducted in the coming months, sources said. CCP had procured the land at Bainguinim for the plant, but the Manohar Parrikar-led government decided to hand over the project in 2017 to Goa Waste Management Corporation where the then chief minister was chairman. According to sources, the state government is looking at three agencies to execute the Bainguinim solid waste treatment facility \u2014 Goa Waste Management Corporation, Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation and Imagine Panaji. \u201cIf required, (BJP Calangute MLA) Michael Lobo should be made chairman of Goa Waste Management Corporation or he should be given more powers to get it done. The others seem preoccupied,\u201d Monserrate said. It\u2019s been over a decade that the Bainguinim site was proposed to take care of waste generated in Tiswadi, Ponda and Sattari. Though the CCP has a relatively strong system of waste collection and management, it requires a facility to tackle plastic, e-waste, construction debris and other forms of complex waste. \u201cI will take this issue up in the assembly,\u201d Monserrate said.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM.

The complaint stated that Muslims from these areas have been burying their dead at the St Inez kabrastan since 1961, until September 2017 when the CCP stopped the burial of those outside its jurisdiction stating that there was limited space. Pointing out that there is no kabrastan for the people of Merces and Bambolim to bury their dead, the trust has requested the government to permit burial of people from Merces, Bambolim and Curca at the St Inez kabrastan till the government or local authority provides a piece of land.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing.

There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker.

Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

D\u2019Souza, considered to be one of the finest officers in the state administration, served as additional secretary (finance) for over a decade, and also as additional secretary to the chief minister. He has now been posted as additional secretary (housing) with additional charge of director (training), Goa Institute of Public administration and Rural Development (GIPARD). This is the first major bureaucratic reshuffle of officers of the Goa civil services since chief minister Pramod Sawant took over the reigns of the state in March. Sources said that a few ministers had repeatedly complained against D\u2019Souza during the past one year, as he perused through proposals referred to his department with a fine-tooth comb. It had resulted in some objectionable proposals either being kept on hold or delayed. When Parrikar was at the helm, the complaints of these ministers were shown the bin. However, the demand for his ouster from the finance department grew considerably after Parrikar\u2019s demise. In February, some ministers, including health minister Vishwajit Rane and revenue minister Rohan Khaunte, had alleged at a cabinet meeting chaired by Parrikar at his private residence in Dona Pauala that D\u2019Souza was \u201cobstructing development\u201d by not clearing files. Sources said that Parrikar had specifically instructed the finance department not to clear files under pressure from his ministerial colleagues unless they vetted the proposals. Finance department\u2019s objections to inflated rates for items listed in tenders had resulted in the ministers concerned taking up cudgels against D\u2019Souza. The file then used to go to Parrikar, and he would stand by the finance department\u2019s notings. A political observer said that it now seems like the chief minister has succumbed to pressure from ministers who wanted him to transfer D\u2019Souza. \u201cD\u2019Souza is not the only officer, but there are complaints from some minisers of \u2018non-cooperation\u201d, sources said. D\u2019Souza has been replaced by Sunil Masurkar, additional secretary, health.

Director of panchayat Rajan Satardekar has been appointed as transport director, while Gopal Parsekar is the new panchayat director. Similarly, Ashutosh Apte, state registrar-cum-head of notary services has been appointed director of directorate of mines and geology, while Ajit Pawaskar, additional commissioner of excise, has been transferred and posted as joint secretary, health.

Acharya was retained by Parrikar as director of mines from 2012. Last week, Sawant replaced advocate general Dattaprasad Lawande, who was handling mining matters. Similarly, Neetal Amonkar, who was awaiting posting, has been appointed as managing director, Goa Education Development Corporation (GEDC), with additional charge of state project director, Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

He hinted that fish entering Goa\u2019s markets from other states during the ban could contain formalin. Insisting that Alemao\u2019s claims be dismissed, Rane said random checks are being conducted and fish samples are even being collected for testing. \u201cA whole protocol has been laid down.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

They have been told that the power to reject such leave requests lies only with the education secretary or director of education. Several teachers from privately managed schools have, in the past, complained that they had been denied CCL even though their need for it was genuine. \u201cCCL applications shall be disposed of within 30 days, except where the case is forwarded to the government for approval,\u201d DoE has instructed school managements. The DoE has, however, said that as per its guidelines, teachers can claim CCL only from the start of either the first or second term of the academic year, and not mid- term. Any CCL claimed in the middle of the academic year in case of an emergency, has to be supported by the necessary documents. Female employees are eligible for a maximum of two years, or 730 days, of CCL during their entire term of service. The leave can be used to either extend maternity leave, or to tend to a sick child, or even to help children with board exam preparations. The DoE has told teachers that at least 90 days should pass between two periods of leave claimed under CCL. \u201cApplications for CCL should be submitted at least two months in advance by a school\u2019s teaching and non-teaching staff to the leave sanctioning authority, except during emergency situations like child sickness etc. In normal circumstances, the leave sanctioning authority should ensure that the normal functioning of the primary school, high school, higher secondary school and administration in not paralysed,\u201d the DoE guidelines state.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

He also said that he has called for a meeting with the tourism minister and chairman of Goa Tourism Development Corporation to discuss the implementation of the state\u2019s tourism master plan at the earliest. \u201cIt has become a habit for many to go against government policies,\u201d Sawant said. \u201cIf we are going wrong somewhere, point it out and we are open to corrections.

He was responding to freedom fighter Chandrakant Pednekar, who raised the issue of giving ownership rights to residents of Mayem. Sawant said that he has called for files related to the issue and that he would begin the process of issuing the sanads.

Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

With the state government struggling to find a way to restart mining operations, the association said that some mining firms had already begun to offer employees voluntary retirement schemes (VRS) and other financial options. The Supreme Court in February 2018 quashed the second renewal of iron ore mining leases given to 88 companies, bringing mining operations in the state to a halt from March 16, 2018. \u201cFrom May 2012 to October 2015 was the first time that mining was halted, but even then majority of the companies gave no layoffs or it was very minimal. Since last year the pressure is building on a day-to-day basis, so much so that companies are offering financial options to their employees to take VRS or take settlement,\u201d managing director of Fomento Resources and GMOEA president Ambar Timblo said. Chief minister Pramod Sawant met with a delegation of mining dependant people, who informed him about the pressure to retrench workers. Sawant in a statement urged mining firms not to retrench staff since mining activities could resume in November. Timblo said that larger companies, who have diversified interests such as Vedanta and Fomento Resources, have the capacity to bear the financial burden of salaries and overheads for a longer duration. However, in eight months to a year even these companies will struggle to keep staff on their payrolls. \u201cThe larger business houses and mining companies like a Vedanta or a Salgaocar or Chowgule are the last ones to do the layoffs. The first layoffs were the labour that came from outside of Goa. Then it will be the lower income employees,\u201d he said. Retrenching confirmed employees, who have been working for decades with companies, will be most difficult, he added. In July 2018, Chowgule and Company Pvt Ltd, has sought permission from the ministry of labour and employment to lay off 347 permanent employees in the state. In April, another company informed workers that they would be retrenched and would be compensated with a month\u2019s wage. \u201cEverybody else who subcontracted, had machinery contractors or truck business have laid off much earlier in 2013, 2014 and 2015. They have been consistently retrenching because there has been absolutely no business other than one-and-half-year for the industry,\u201d Timblo said. The GMOEA, which remains optimistic, met with NITI Aayog officials where they gave a presentation on Goa\u2019s mining industry and the possible steps to restart operations in the state.

While this may be the most delayed monsoon in a decade, the IMD had earlier forecast that monsoon would hit Goa between June 12-15. Though the monsoon arrived in Kerala, there is no further progress as of now. \u201cOur analysis shows it will take four to five days for the monsoon to hit Goa. It may vary. Regarding the monsoon onset statistics, we have to check our records for further clarification on whether it is the most delayed monsoon in the last two decades or not. We expect the monsoon to progress upwards in a few days towards the north of the peninsula,\u201d IMD director, K V Padgalwar said. The department has attributed the delay in the monsoon in Goa to cyclone Vayu absorbing moisture from the west coast before taking it along towards the north of the peninsula. The delay has also increased the rain deficit further. As of now, Padgalwar said, the conditions for the monsoon are not favourable. \u201cAny trough visible in the western coast is known as an off-shore trough. Currently, there is no off-shore trough here. The depression in the Bay of Bengal is not moving either. It is stagnated there for the past four to five days, its position is the same,\u201d he said. Parts of the state experienced cloudy weather on Tuesday. The department this to south westerly winds bringing in moisture, thus developing clouds. But this moisture is not enough to result in rain. The weather alert cautioning fishermen from venturing into the seas is still active as a result. \u201cThe information provided from buoys has reported winds blowing at 20-30 knots.

MMC and Fomento may each argue that the other is to blame for the crisis, but as per the concession agreement signed between the two, a copy of which is with TOI, both are equally at fault. If Fomento failed to put into operation the landfill at the site for safe disposal of inert, MMC never bothered to cart away the reject of the unprocessed waste as mandated in the agreement. Resultantly, the inert and the reject, both comprising nearly 60% of the incoming daily waste, landed atop the decades-old mountain of garbage. A source closely associated with the setting up of the plant told TOI that the concession agreement never mandated that MMC segregate the waste and instead entailed the task to be carried out by Fomento. Fomento argues that the non-segregation of waste was the failure behind the plant not working at an optimum level. And therein lies the rub. \u201cAs MMC failed to provide us with segregated waste, the reject (of unprocessed waste) were on the higher side. Despite many reminders from time to time, MMC failed to cart away the reject, and therefore, left with no option, this 35-40% of the waste, along with the inert (15-20% of the waste), would be piled atop the existing garbage dump,\u201d a company official said. Resultantly, the decades-old mountain of garbage, which was what was originally intended to be eliminated as per the agreement, kept on rising raising questions about the efficacy of the plant. \u201cThe MSW Rules 2016 that mandate segregation at source came into force only in 2016, while the concession agreement was signed in 2011. It\u2019s clear Fomento intends to fall back on the changes in rules to defend its failure,\u201d a source closely associated with the setting up of the plant told TOI. Moreover, MMC also failed to put in any monitoring mechanism to oversee the operations of the plant, as outlined in the concession agreement. \u201cThe MMC never bothered to reply to the correspondence made to it by Fomento, and mutely acted as per the dictates of Fomento. It\u2019s now paying the price for being a silent spectator, or rather turning its eye away from the irregularities at Sonsoddo,\u201d former chairperson of MMC Savio Coutinho, during whose tenure the concession agreement was inked, said. The foundation stone for the plant was laid on October 2, 2011. As per the original concession agreement, Fomento and IL&FS were to set up a 50-75 tonne per day capacity plant on design, build, own, operate and transfer (DBOOT) basis for a period of 25 years, at a cost of Rs 7.3 crore. However, sources said the plant never became fully functional as Fomento failed to make the landfill at the site operational. Inert, non-biodegradable residual matter of processed waste comprising 15-20% of the waste processed, had to be dumped here. The underbelly of the operations at Sonsoddo was exposed only after the recent fire at the dump. With locals protesting against more dumping of waste here, Fomento began piling the reject inside the plant until there was not enough space to handle incoming garbage. That was when Fomento blocked entry to MMC\u2019s garbage trucks since Monday, triggering the crisis. Spread over 15,000sqm and containing 1.5 lakh tonne of mixed waste \u2014 and still rising with every passing day \u2014 the dump has turned out to be a major challenge for the MMC and the government, as acknowledged by deputy chief minister Vijai Sardesai. The original proposal was to set up the plant after clearing one half of the garbage dump, while the remainder was to be capped with impermeable layers after screening the waste. \u201cGas wells would be constructed to take out methane and other gases formed inside. Peripheral roads will be built for material movement and inspection. The capped dump would have post-closure protocol to take care of the facility for 15 years and to monitor the leachate and gas production and to see that there is no harm to the environment,\u201d the plant\u2019s project proposal stated. However, this technical requirement was rendered redundant after MMC provided additional 57,700sqm land adjoining the existing garbage dump, for setting up the plant. Subsequently, Fomento came out with a proposal for scientific capping of the garbage dump, an idea that was, however, shot down by the Goa State Pollution Control Board citing environmental concerns. The change in location of the plant and the proposal for scientific capping of the garbage dump meant doing away with the necessity of segregating and treating the garbage dump. Though scientific capping of the garbage dump failed to materialise, the original idea of eliminating the old dump was conveniently relegated to the back-burner. A source well versed with the legal matters of MMC, requesting anonymity, expressed apprehensions that the recent developments at Sonsoddo could help Fomento leverage the situation to its advantage by forcing MMC to terminate the agreement, and consequently enter into litigation and claim substantial costs. \u201cNevertheless, it\u2019s imperative that the government intervene in the matter and salvage the situation in the interests of the city and its people. Waste management technology keeps on innovating every four-five years and thus, the technology employed at Sonsoddo plant appears to have been outdated. An innovative technological solution is what is needed at Sonsoddo,\u201d the source said.

The decision to start the process afresh was subsequently taken by NGPDA at its 73rd meeting on Monday. A resolution was also taken to complete the entire process within nine months. \u201cThis ODP was prepared in 2016 and has been asked to be redone,\u201d said NGPDA chairman Michael Lobo. \u201cNGPDA met today and it has been decided that the Mapusa land use map and register will be prepared along with that of Panaji.\u201d Lobo said that when ODP was prepared in 2016, NGPDA chose not to prepare a land use map and register, which was the main reason for starting the ODP process from scratch. \u201cThe land use map and register for Panaji were not there since there was an existing ODP. We took the ODP as a base map. But the government has asked us to make a fresh land use map and register to identify all structures, including small structures and also government structures and pumping stations,\u201d Lobo said. Every structure, whether residential, commercial, government and even utilities will be mapped this time to ensure that land utilization is clearly depicted in the ODP. The planning body will also identify encroachments on government and private land. Lobo, however, did not specify what action will be taken against such encroachments. \u201cThere is a lot of land touching the river where there are encroachments. There is land which has been used for various government projects which otherwise on the plan is shown as orchard or vacant land. We need to specify what it has been used for,\u201d Lobo said. NGPDA will begin the process by issuing a public notice inviting objections and suggestions from the public. The entire process to map the structures in Mapusa and Panaji will be contracted to a private agency which will then prepare the land use map. This time around, Lobo said, NGPDA has also decided to get on board councillors from the local municipal bodies. Lobo has urged the Corporation of the City of Panaji and the Mapusa Municipal Council to help NGPDA with the drafting process. \u201cWe will come up with a tender notice to see that we take an agency on board to mark all these structures and give us a ready map. Local councillors and the people have to give suggestions and objections which have to tally with the agency\u2019s work,\u201d said Lobo. The MLA said the process to prepare the land use map and register will take three months and preparation of the draft ODP will take two months, while the final ODP will take another three months.

The eye sore, which is in blatant violation of the plastic ban, comes at a time when the city is already grappling with garbage problems and despite the municipality stating that the fair would be plastic-free this year. Water was seen stagnating in the plastic waste as vendors packed up and left. President of the New Market Traders Association Vinod Shirodkar said this will result in breeding of mosquitoes and a rise in dengue and other vector-borne diseases. The plastic ban, he said, is only being forced on traders at the new market. \u201cDon\u2019t the rules apply to them too? Who is taking action against them? First take action on those who left behind the garbage and then impose the plastic ban on others,\u201d Shirodkar said. Instead of imposing fines on shops handing out plastic bags, stop the problem at the source, he said. \u201cFirst shut the factories producing plastic bags. You\u2019re keeping the factories open and huge trucks bearing plastic bags are being brought in. Why aren\u2019t they being stopped on the way and action taken against them?\u201d Shirodkar said.

The notification will come as a relief not only to new brides but also to those who have registered their marriages in the past. \"There is no cut-off date. Any woman wishing to change her name by adopting her husband's surname can apply for a correction in her marriage certificate. It will be corrected and given to her,\" an official said, adding that those interested will have to make an application and produce proof of their husbands' identity. Since pre-Liberation days, the option of adopting the husband's surname in the marriage certificate at the time of registration was available only to Hindu brides. Women from Christian, Muslim and other communities were forced to go through the cumbersome process of changing their names later, by producing various documents and even publishing a notice in the government gazette.

The protests began after a couple of the age-old trees were felled, and activists tried to save the rest. Alongside Sardesai were historian Prajal Sakhardande, social activist Patricia Pinto, and others. After the protests, the citizens made their way to the Panaji police station to file a complaint. The protestors said that when the reconstruction of the crematorium was planned, authorities had promised that the trees would not be touched. Thus, Sardesai said that they were \u201cshocked\u201d to learn on Monday morning that the trees were being felled. She added that the felling was halted after calls were made to several ministers. The protestors said that officials from the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) washed their hands off the tree-cutting, and blamed the Goa State Urban Development Agency (GSUDA). They also wanted to know why CCP shrugged off all responsibility and refused to intervene. Meanwhile, Sakhardande said that they would not allow any more trees to be cut at the site. Pinto said that development means more than concretisation, and that preserving trees was an essential part of keeping the city developed.

Sanganna\u2019s candidature was withheld as the BJP is waiting for the JD(S)-Congress coalition to name its candidate.
