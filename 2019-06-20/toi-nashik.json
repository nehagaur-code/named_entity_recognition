A surprise pick by the ruling BJP-led NDA   , Birla's name was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself for the post, sources said. The 56-year-old leader is considered to be close to both Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah. Birla's nomination for the Lok Sabha Speaker's post also has the   backing of non-NDA parties   such as the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). Starting his political journey as a student leader, Birla was also elected to the Rajasthan Assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. He won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was again elected this year from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. Birla defeated Congress's Ramnarayan Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently-concluded general election. A conscientious parliamentarian, Birla has registered an 86-per cent average attendance in the House, asked 671 questions, participated in 163 debates and introduced six private members' bills in the 16th Lok Sabha. From 1991 to 2003, he was a key leader in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) as a state-level president first and then, as a vice-president at the national level. Birla, who holds a Masters degree in commerce, is a member of the Standing Committee on Energy in Parliament, the Committee on Petitions and the Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. He succeeds eight-time MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Lok Sabha Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this is not the first time that a relative newcomer has occupied the position. In 1996, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader G M C Balayogi, also a two-time MP then, was elected as the Speaker in the Lower House of Parliament. After his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

The businessmen have asked the police to step up vigil to prevent any such incidents in future. On Friday, six armed robbers entered the office of the Muthoot Finance and shot dead an IT engineer of the company, Sanju Samuel, when he tried to stop them from thrashing the branch manager for not handing over the keys of the strong room. \"The incident is an indication about the rising confidence of criminals to strike even in broad daylight. There are thousands of businessmen who deal with huge amount of cash on daily basis and after Friday's incident they have become fearful,\" a city-based businessman said. According to him, police need to act swiftly to instill confidence among traders and businessmen. \"There have been some incidents related to shop break-ins that are yet to be resolved. We feel that policing in the city has to be more impactful that would deter the goons from carrying out such activities,\" he said. The president of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MACCIA), Santosh Mandlecha, confessed that the city businessmen have become fearful after that incident. \"Our request to the police is take corrective measures immediately. We have an efficient police chief and the need of the hour is to identity the criminals and take strict action against them,\" he said. Gorakh Chaudhary, president of the Nashik Druggist and Chemist Association, said Friday's incident has raised question over the quality of policing in the city. \"I feel that the city police should put in more efforts to ensure that the city is safe. Unless they send a strong message to the criminals, such incidents would continue to take place,\" he said. Meanwhile, police commissioner Vishwas Nagare Patil assured the businessmen that they would go all out to ensure that Nashik is a safe city. \"The incident that took place on Friday is a rare one. Our investigation so far has revealed that an organised syndicate of criminals was behind it. We have already initiated several steps to prevent such incidents,\" he said. According to Nagare Patil, from Saturday five beat marshals and two vehicles have been provided to each of the 13 police stations across the city. \"These beat marshals have been directed to undertake patrolling round-the-clock. And senior police officers will have to monitor the movement of the beat marshals several times on a daily basis,\" the police chief added.

Owing to this, from Monday, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has imposed once-a-day water supply instead of the regular twice-a-day supply in all areas that come under Nashik Road and Panchavati divisions of the civic body. Moreover, the civic body has written to the water resources department (WRD) urging the latter to refrain from releasing water for any stakeholders from the Gangapur Dam complex. The civic body fears that any discharge of water from the dam complex would bring the water level below the intake well at the dam following which it would not be able to draw water. The intake well is the structure that allows NMC to safely draw water from the dam. \u201cThe water availability scenario has become stressed as there has virtually been no rain so far,\u201d a civic official said. Water from the Gangapur Dam complex is released by the WRD on rotation for drinking and agricultural purposes for NMC, MIDC, farmers of the district and a small amount for Ahmednagar district. \u201cIf the water level of the dam depletes any further, we would not be able to lift water from the dam for city residents. Hence, we have written to the WRD on the issue,\u201d the official said. The Gangapur Dam complex, which meets over 80% of city\u2019s water requirement, currently has 1,097 mcft of water \u2014 around 11% of the total capacity of the dam. The remaining 20% of the requirement is met from Darna and Mukane dams. However, at present, the NMC has stopped lifting water from Darna since May 22 following some contamination of water. The NMC official said that of the 4,900 mcft of water reserved for the NMC from October 15 last year to July 31 this year in Gangapur Dam complex, the civic body has already used 3,873 mcft of water. Presently, the NMC\u2019s daily requirement is 16mcft of water and it is lifting 13.5 mcft of water from Gangapur dam complex and remaining 2.5 mcft from Mukane dam. Meanwhile, the WRD called upon the NMC to supply water judiciously as there has been no rain yet. \u201cOur water release rotation to most of the stakeholders is complete. We have to release about 35 mcft of water to MIDC and about 650 mfct to the NMC. They will get their share of water and it is up to the civic body how to use it,\u201d a WRD official said.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

Tata Project has won the bid to install 92,000 smart LED lights across the city on a public-private-partnership (PPP). The NMC had given the letter of intent to the company around one-and-a-half months ago, to carry out the smart light project. As per the conditions set by the NMC, the company should sign an agreement with the municipal corporation within a month. However, the company is yet to sign an agreement with the NMC even after a month's time has passed. The civic body had also requested the company to sign an agreement a few days back and start working on the project. Hence, the NMC has given a letter to Tata Projects to sign an agreement with the civic body within a week. Otherwise, the NMC will go ahead with the tender conditions of the project, said sources from the civic body. LED street lights are to be installed in lieu of rights for sharing energy saving on a PPP basis for the entire city area on design, build, finance, operate, maintain, monetize and transfer basis. The project would overhaul the traditional system of street lighting in a big way by adopting a smart IT-enabled street lighting system. The project includes features like intelligent IT innovations for transportation, civic utilities and public safety without adding significantly more physical infrastructure and real-time data communications with low latency to improve safety and security. Moreover, the smart LED street lights are to be installed with functional features like remote dimming control, remote on-off option, timer, GPS map representation. The total project cost is Rs171 crore, which will be borne by the TPT. The company has quoted 60% energy savings and 5% power sharing with the NMC. Presently, the NMC is paying a Rs2.75 crore electricity bill per month. The smart LED street light project will enable the municipal corporation to save Rs12-13 lakh per month.

The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.

In December last year, the central government had doubled the incentives from 5% to 10% to boost export and thereby stabilise the wholesale price of onions. The decision had been taken following a crash in wholesale price. The government removed the incentives on onion export last Thursday after the average wholesale price of onions shot up. The wholesale market, which was closed during the weekend, reopened on Monday. The average wholesale price of onion dropped from Rs 1,320 per quintal on Thursday to Rs 1,200 per quintal on Monday. While the average wholesale price of onions was recorded at Rs 1,200 per quintal at Lasalgaon APMC on Monday, the minimum and maximum wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs 600 per quintal and Rs 1,430 per quintal respectively on the same day. The drop in the wholesale price of onions is likely to prevail for a few days. \"There has been a rise in the demand for onions as compared to the present supply. Hence, the average wholesale price of onions may increase and may also touch the Rs 1,500 per quintal-mark by the first week of July,\" said sources in the Lasalgaon APMC. Presently, there is no fresh harvest of onions till mid-October. The onions arriving in the market are the summer produce harvested in March and April. These onions have a shelf life of six months and farmers prefer storing this variety of onions with a hope of getting a better price. \"Currently, farmers are busy planning the kharif crops to be sown. They will bring onions to the market only if they require money. The supply of onions will be comparatively low,\" said the sources from Lasalgaon APMC.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The farmers stated that they were cheated of Rs 1.5 crore by Shirsath. The farmers later came to know that Shirsath had escaped to Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, the Nashik rural police on the instructions of SP Arti Singh were keeping a strict vigil to ensure that Shirsath was immediately nabbed once he returned to India. After awaiting his return for three months, the police got information that Shirsath had come back to Nashik. The police subsequently started keeping a watch on his friends and relatives. The police then got a tip-off that Shirsath was hiding in the Satpur or Khutwadnagar area of Nashik city. The rural police then laid a trap and arrested him from the MICO circle area of Nashik city.

This is where the role of medicos comes into play. The medicos have to strengthen their social awareness and consciousness and reach out to the people in need,\u201d said Dr Vatwani. He was the chief guest at the 21st anniversary of the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS). Vice-Chancellor Dileep Mhaisekar, Pro-VC Mohan Khamgaonkar and several others were also present at the programme. \u201cThe country has a huge number of people who need psychiatrists to treat them. There are young and old professionals like doctors and engineers in that category as well. The country requires a very strong and large force to deal with the patients. At this point of time, any numbers that are coming in for help will still fall short,\u201d said Dr Vatwani, who, through his Shraddha Rehabilitation Foundation, has so far searched, treated, restored and reunited at least 2,000 mentally ill people with their families \u2014 who had lost hopes of the same \u2014 across the country. Dr Dileep Mhaisekar, in his presidential address, pointed out that mobile technology was having a damaging effect on the brain and that regular yoga could help the brain in these trying conditions of the modern age. \u201cWhile we are dealing with technology, that is apparently making life easier, the same technology on the other hand is taking a toll on human life. The over-use of mobiles is affecting people\u2019s brains and is making life miserable, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has noted,\u201d said Dr Mhaisekar. Dr Mhaisekar went on to add that people should practice yoga in order to help the mind and the body steer clear of the problems that may be caused due to modern technology. \u201cPractice yoga regularly to come out of any chronic physical and mental illnesses as well,\u201d he said. In all, 50 gold medals were presented to 41 students from the first year to the third year for doing well in various subjects.

The incident was a near re-run of the shooting that left an IT engineer dead at the office of Muthoot Finance Company in Nashik city just four days ago. The criminals fired once at Karan Singh Negi (31), who foiled the robbery attempt and got the duo fleeing for the exit by pressing the burglar alarm. Negi was hit by the bullet in the shoulder and died on the way to hospital following excessive bleeding. Police said the robbers came to the bank on a motorcycle wearing black helmets. They did not take off their helmets as they entered the bank brandishing revolvers around 2.20pm. One of them fired a bullet at a wall in the bank in an attempt to frighten the five bank employees, including two women. Bank official foils robbery bid in Raver village, killedJalgaon superintendent of police Panjabrao Ugle told TOI that one of the robbers tried to overpower Negi at his workstation. \u201cHowever, Negi immediately bent down and pressed the burglar alarm, which caught the goons off guard. They quickly turned to the exit. When Negi stood up, one of the robbers fired at him. The bullet hit Negi in the right shoulder and he collapsed on the floor,\u201d he said. Negi, who hails from Himachal Pradesh, was living in a rented house in Nimbol. Police officials commended him for displaying alacrity by pressing the alarm, which prevented the criminals from robbing the bank. Bank officials said the branch manager was out for a meeting when the robbers entered. \u201cIt is extremely painful that Negi died in such a gruesome manner,\u201d a senior bank functionary said. On June 14, IT engineer M Saju Samuel was shot dead when he took on six armed robbers at the office of Muthoot Finance Company in Nashik city. Samuel too had pressed the burglar alarm after the robbers stormed in, which forced them to flee without taking anything. The Vijaya Bank branch at Nimbol is around 17km from the Madhya Pradesh border. The Jalgaon police enforced nakabandi across Jalgaon district and along the roads leading to the MP border. Ugle said the two robbers spoke in both Marathi and Hindi. The police said they were yet to establish in which direction the robbers had fled. Officials and personnel from the Nimbhora police station, which is 17km away from Nimbol, rushed to the bank around 3pm. Some villagers told the police that they had seen the two robbers spend time sitting in the compound of an empty house opposite the bank. \u201cThey left a water bottle there. They were probably waiting for the right time to enter the bank. There were no customers in the bank when they entered,\u201d a police official said. Meanwhile, the state home department has taken a strong view of the two armed robberies at two financial institutions in North Maharashtra within a span of just five days. Minister of state for home Deepak Kesarkar said he was upset with the Jalgaon police for the shooting at Vijaya Bank. \u201cAfter the Nashik shooting incident, the police in all districts in the region should have been on high alert.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing. Living with the dead: A grave in the backyard\"All we are asking for is some land for our ancestors. There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar. Their burial grounds are filled to capacity,\" said Nizam Khan, a mechanic. Village pradhan Sundar Kumar said that he had asked officials several times for a burial ground for Muslim families, but no action was taken.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

They will carry rainwater from the respective watershed areas into the Panjhan river. Thereafter, a weir can be constructed to pick up water for supply to the town,\" Khanapurkar said. This entire plan will cost Rs70 crore and provide space to store water and encourage its seepage. Stressing on recharging underground aquifers, as done in Dhule, Khanapurkar said deepening and widening of the nullahs would go a long way in water conservation. \"There is already a Rs290-crore scheme proposed for Manmad.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The agency will conduct a door-to-door survey in the city on the issue, seeking feedback about present plight of the public transport and their expectations about the metro project. NMC has given its permission to Rites to conduct the survey and a consent letter mentioning the same. Moreover, Rites will also conduct topographical survey, which includes casting of DGPS pillars, traversing, levelling and detailing along the road in the public premises grounds, parks, depot area and collection of utilities data along the corridor in Nashik. Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (Maha Metro) has already conducted feasibility report amounting to Rs 1,800 crore. The project will see deployment of high-speed mass transit urban trams - each carrying up to 80 passengers at a time. Two trackless elevated corridors - about 28 kilometres long - would be constructed as part of the Nashik project. The corridor will accommodate high-speed rubber-tyred urban trams drawing power from overhead electric cables. One elevated corridor with a length of 18.45 km will stretch from Shramik Nagar to Nashik railway station with 17 stations. The second elevated corridor will be from Gangapur to Mumbai Naka - a distance of 9.45 km. This corridor will have 10 stations. But these high-speed trams will be able to leave the elevated corridors and ply on normal city roads for about 25 km under battery power. After the feasibility reports by the Maha Metro, the detailed project reports (DPR) of the project is to be done by the Rites Ltd. During the household survey, they will take information from families about the transport they are using and what kind of transport system the residents are expecting. Moreover, the agency will also take feedback about their daily travelling.

While 25 deaths have taken place between 2015 and 2018 in 20 accidents, three deaths took place in the current year in as many mishaps, the city police said. Commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare Patil expressed concern while reviewing the deaths due to the presence of trees on the roads. He has sent a letter to municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game on Wednesday, requesting him to come up with some kind of solution so that precious lives are not lost. \"These fully grown trees have virtually become a death trap for motorists at night. Although reflectors have been put on the tree trunks, it is serving no purpose as the mishaps and death toll indicate,\" said traffic police officials. In the latest incident in the wee hours of Wednesday, Vishnu Pol, a 29-year-old police constable who was returning home from duty, failed to notice a huge tree on the Gangapur Road and dashed against it. \"Pol is in coma and battling for life in the ICU at a city hospital as he sustained grave injuries. Fortunately, some policemen who were on petrol in that area could rush him to hospital during the golden hour,\" police officials said. On May 29, a car driver lost his life when his car hit a tree on Gangapur Road. The city traffic police had recently conducted a survey and found huge trees at 25 locations on roads. \"These trees are present on busy thoroughfares like Gangapur Road, Nashik Road, Dindori Road and Indiranagar. The civic body must find a solution to the issue,\" police officers said. Nangare Patil said that he expects the civic body to take measures on the issue to prevent mishaps and deaths related to trees on roads. Nangare Patil's predecessor, Ravinder Singal, too had taken up this issue during a meeting with the Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd officials. He had requested them to deal with the issue seriously as it was claiming lives of motorists.

We shall also put proper reflectors on the tyres and sacks so that it is visible at night from a distance.\" In the long term, the civic body would apprise the high court about the findings of the city police related to mishaps and deaths caused due to the trees on roads. \"A case related to felling of trees on road is being heard by the high court, which has directed us not to cut trees of rare species.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

In a way, it kind of prepares future entrepreneurs,\u201d shares Dr Dhanesh Kalal, principal of BYK College. In all this, these colleges also maintain the fact that academic shouldn't be affected.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

The committee's inquiry revealed that between 2010 and 2015, there were 963 registered children's homes in the state. These homes belong to the state government but are run by NGOs. Of these, 213 were shut in 2016 after the authorities found that the names of over 74,000 children were fake. In 2017, three more children's homes were shut by the state women and child development department, taking the total to 216. The action was taken after the state adopted a policy of rechecks and new registrations of children with biometric impression, Aadhar card number and personal identification. Most irregularities were found during the rechecks. Three of the homes that were derecognized were from Mumbai and the suburban district, while half -- 107 - were located in Beed, Nanded, Osmanabad, Latur and Parbhani in Marathwada. The rest were in Solapur, Satara, Pune, Ahmednagar and Nashik.

Samuel managed to free himself from the clutches of the robbers and rushed to help branch manager Chandrashekhar Deshpande (64), who was being repeatedly hit on the head with the butt of a revolver. The robbers were demanding that Deshpande hand over the keys of the strong room where cash and gold were kept.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

The administration will soon table a proposal on reintroduction of the incentive before the general body. A similar scheme was in effect in the city for years but former municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe withdrew it from the fiscal year 2018-19. Present municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game has directed the officials of the property and water tax departments to prepare a proposal about the incentives to be given to the prompt tax payers and also those who make online payment, NMC sources said. The tax collection has suffered as many civic employees were busy with Lok Sabha election-related works. With the forthcoming assembly elections, the civic officials are apprehensive that its tax collection would be affected again. So, the NMC has planned to reintroduce the scheme. The details about the percentage of incentives would be chalked out and tabled at the general body meeting. Under the earlier scheme, tax payers who pay annual property tax in April would get 5% rebate in tax and 3% if they paid in May. Those who pay in June would get 2% rebate. This would help the NMC generate more revenue through property tax in just three months. The civic body is also mulling to give rebate in property tax if the bills are paid online. Since its staff was on election duty, the NMC could not distribute property tax bills in time. As a result, it could collect only Rs 16 crore till by June 17, against Rs 40 crore during the corresponding period last year. Moreover, 18,500 citizens have defaulted on tax dues worth Rs 146 crore. This is another challenge for the municipal corporation. The NMC had earned Rs 112 crore through property tax during 2018-19. For 2019-20, it has set a tax collection target of Rs 218 crore.

Fadnavis chaired a meeting on Wednesday regarding measures to be taken to improve water supply in Manmad town, the third-largest urban pocket in Nashik district. The town, which is also a key railway junction, has been getting tap water every 21 days. The meeting was attended by water resources minister Girish Mahajan, minister of state for water resources Vijay Shivtare, chief officer of Manmad Municipal Council Dilip Menkar, Dindori BJP MP Bharti Pawar and NCP MLA Pankaj Bhujbal. The twitter handle of the chief minister's office tweeted \"CM approved extended water supply scheme for Manmad.\" Menkar told TOI that under the project, an 80-km pipeline will bring water from the British-era Karanjavan dam in Dindori taluka to the proposed water treatment plant at Manmad. Overhead water tanks would be set up in various locations of the town for distribution to different localities of the town. It would take three years for the state government to complete the project. \"The dam has huge capacity and even the dead stock of the dam would enable us to ensure proper water supply to Manmad for two years. We would lift the water from the dam using solar power,\" added Menkar. A part of the fund would also be used to overhaul the existing water supply infrastructure in the town to prevent water leakages. Local civic officials said this project would help 1.30 lakh people residing in the town during summer. This year, the situation became so grim that the supply was initially restricted to once in 18 days and later once a month. The Waghdardi dam, from which the civic body draws water, had completely dried up in late May. The civic body was unable to provide water to residents. Nashik district administration had directed the civic body to immediately press tankers into service to provide water to the township. Things improved after water was released from the Palkhed dam early this month. The Save Manmad Action Committee (SMAC) had filed in PIL in Bombay high court about the water crisis that the residents have to face every year during summer. The state government later formed a panel to study the issue at Manmad. The outfit has expressed happiness over the approval for the project. \"Our organisation has been fighting for seven years to improve the water supply system in the town. It has now borne fruit. We hope that the project sees the light of the day within the time frame set by the state government,\" said Rekha Yenare, a senior member of the outfit.

Rainwater harvesting is mandatory as per development control and promotion regulation (DCPR) of Nashik approved by the state government in January 2017. Recently, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) also ordered all municipal corporations to start imposing fines on residential and commercial complexes that do not have rainwater harvesting. Accordingly, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has already started taking measures in this regard. But as part of this, the NMC has also started provisions of rainwater harvesting at its own buildings and properties like open spaces. \u201cWe have identified 106 spots where rainwater harvesting is to be done. The objective to increase ground water table,\u201d an NMC official said. \u201cWe have already made provisions for rainwater harvesting at 39 spots, including buildings and open spaces of the municipal corporation, while remaining spots are also to be covered under rainwater harvesting within a month,\u201d he added. The building completion certificate (BCC) is given by the town planning department of the NMC only after inspecting if there is provision of rainwater harvesting on the land admeasuring 500 metre and above. Moreover, it is also mandatory that the provision of rainwater harvesting is functional and in good condition or else fine of Rs1,000 is to be imposed for per 100sqmt per year. Rainwater harvesting is nothing but a way of increasing ground water table by storing rainwater through refilling of wells, recharging hand pumps and percolation pits etc. The issue came to surface after NGT in March this year directed the civic administration there to slap fine of Rs5 lakh on projects that do not have rainwater harvesting. All big residential societies, commercial complexes, hospitals, educational institutes, industries and other organisations should make provision for rainwater harvesting before this rainy season. According to the order, municipal corporations should implement rainwater harvesting in their respective jurisdictions, and should slap fines if the order is not followed.
