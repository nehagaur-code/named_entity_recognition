{"Fish farmers in Ernakulam take to sale of live fish": {"description": "KOCHI: Inland fish farmers, who are struggling to sell their produce in the absence of marketing avenues, have reason to cheer as a new trend of live fish sales is fast catching up. A handful of young fish farmers have embarked on sale of live fish either at their own farms or specific sales points near highways or small towns. Advantages are many: Consumers can get chemical-free fish fresh from the nets and since there are no middlemen, farmers can earn a good revenue. But it can be risky if there are not enough sales because frequent transfer from ponds and life fish sale tanks can stress out the fish. Such sales outlets have come up in areas like Perumbavoor and Kothamangalam, which have lot of inland fish farms. \u201cWe are getting a lot of calls from farmers who want to know whether we can sell their fish,\u201d said Shaji Varghese, a farmer associated with Farmers\u2019 Facilitation Centre, formed under Sanskara, a cultural organization at Kothamangalam. Varghese, who works as a promoter under Fish Farmer Development Agency (FFDA) and owns a farm at Varapettty said the outlet could solve a major issue faced by fish farmers. His live fish sale outlet was recently moved to a plot near Bishop\u2019s House at Kothamangalam in the highway. Encouraged by the prospects, more farmers are joining the bandwagon. Dhanesh, who grows fish at Methala village, has gone one step further and introduced mobile live fish sale to reach out to more customers. \u201cThe response so far was quite good but we should have a minimum sale of 50kg every day if it is to be profitable since I am using a hired vehicle,\u201d said Dhanesh. While there are many takers for live fish, lack of diversity is a problem. Most farmers sell only Gift Tilapia and buyers who look for variety may find it disappointing. Some buyers have an aversion to inland farmed fish because of the feeling that they are less tasty. \u201cThe fish tastes good if it is farmed scientifically with proper feed. But most farmers tend to feed fish with chicken waste because fish feed tends to be costly,\u201d said Renju, who has a farm at Kothamangalam and sells around 40kg of fish every day.

He said they will also grant Rs 8,000 crop incentive to farmers soon after coming into power in the next elections. Pawan further said his government would provide six to 10 LPG cylinders free-of-cost to each family every year. and also promised to fill 3 lakh vacancies in the government departments to provide jobs to youth. Addressing a meeting in Guntur on Monday, Pawan said that the future of the state did not mean the future of Lokesh and Jagan but it was the future of the people. \u201cThe space on the state\u2019s political stage is not TDP\u2019s and YSRC\u2019s property as youth and women are eager to bring change through Jana Sena.\u201d \u201cTDP had lost moral right to rule the state as chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had no control over his legislators who indulged in illegal activities,\u201d Pawan said adding that he jumped into the political arena to bring in a change in the lives of commoners. \u201cWe supported TDP and BJP in the last elections with a hope to transform the state. Unfortunately, both of them have shattered our dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cGuntur city has been left in a lurch despite located a few kilometres away from the capital city. The entire city has been dug out in the guise of laying underground drainage scheme and left without repair. How shocking it is to see 30 people dying of diarrhoea in a city like Guntur? Is it not the failure of the state government? Opposition leader Jaganmohan Reddy is equally responsible for the tragedy as he never dared to question the government by going to the assembly,\u201d he said. He further said they would construct apartments exclusively for Muslims in the city. He appealed to people to support his candidates Chandrasekhar (Guntur West), Zia-Ur-Rehman (East) and MP candidate Bonaboina Srinivas Yadav in the elections, Pawan said they fielded a BC candidate Srinivasa Yadav whereas TDP and YSRC both have given tickets to their own communities.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

Sreedharan, along with a team of experts from Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) Kanpur and Madras, visited the flyover around 8am and inspected the restoration works. The flyover has been closed for traffic for more than a month. Though Sreedharan spent around one and a half hours at the flyover inspecting the pillars, girders and the cracks, he refused to openly speak about the defects. According to DMRC sources, he is expected to submit an inspection report directly to the state government in the coming days based on which the state government will take a call on whether the flyover should be restored or demolished. Sreedharan was roped in for the inspection by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan after a meeting with PWD minister G Sudharkaran last week. Sreedharan, who started the inspection from the northern end of the flyover, walked beneath the 750m flyover and conducted a detailed inspection of each pillar and girder. Alaga Sundara Murthy, professor of structural engineering laboratory at the department of civil engineering at IIT-Madras, and Mahesh Tandon from IIT-Kanpur accompanied him through the inspection. Officials from PWD, roads and bridges development corporation of Kerala limited (RBDCK) and Kitco Ltd were also present. Murthy explained to Sreedharan the findings by the IIT-Madras team, which had earlier conducted a study of the flyover and found structural flaws. He showed him the cracks on the pillars and girders which have been posing threat to the bridge\u2019s stability. The reinforcement and restoration works of the flyover were also monitored by the team. The team reportedly raised concerns about the severe cracks on the girders. After the inspection beneath the bridge, the team went to the top of the bridge where they spent around 15 minutes to inspect the potholes and cracks. After this, Sreedharan concluded the inspection and returned to DMRC office where an internal meeting of all parties involved in the flyover construction was held.

The woman from Mannarkkad had complained of sexual harassment against the Shoranur MLA, following which the later was suspended from the party for six months. During the two-day camp of the DYFI on Saturday and Sunday at Elappully, the DYFI district committee was reconstituted by allegedly demoting some of the party members who had supported the woman. The complainant had tendered her resignation following the move on Sunday. T M Sasi, the new district secretary of DYFI, said the issue of resignation would be taken up in the next district committee meet. He added that the reconstitution of the committee was a normal procedure followed in the organization and it was used to promote people on merit and demote those who do not discharge their responsibilities efficiently. The woman\u2019s complaint against the MLA, who is also a secretariat member of the party district committee, was a major embarrassment for the CPM and DYFI and there were differences within the committee as some members supported the woman and demanded stern action against the MLA. The resignation is also said to be in protest against the elevation of a DYFI leader as the district vice-president, who was accused of tarnishing the image of the woman leader through social media. The MLA was suspended for six months from the party on November 26 after an inquiry commission appointed by the party, consisting of minister A Balan and P K Sreemathi found him guilty. As the punishment period was over, the party is learned to be considering to take him back. But the fresh controversy and the humiliating defeat of the Left in the Lok Sabha polls are likely to delay his reinduction.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

To make a quick buck, withdraw money from an ATM using a valid debit card, then slip back a currency note into the machine and then claim refund for the entire amount from the bank. The bank would credit the money into the account, thereby almost doubling the cash in hand. Such a fraud came to light on Wednesday with the arrest of Amin Khan (42) from Alwar in Rajasthan and Riyaju Khan (27) from Palwal in Haryana, following high drama at Mattancherry. They had withdrawn Rs 10,000 from their accounts when they were caught red-handed by officials from SBI, located right next to the ATM kiosk at Kalvathy in Mattancherry, for trying to cover CCTV camera with a piece of paper at 8.53am. They fled on seeing security guards, only to be chased down by residents and guards, who overpowered and handed them over to Mattancherry police. During interrogation, they revealed their modus operandi. \u201cFor instance, if they withdraw Rs 10,000 and five Rs2000 notes are dispensed, they would slip back one currency note back in. They said that some ATMs would \u2018think\u2019 that the entire amount was being taken back,\u201d said Mattancherry CI VS Navas. The accused would call up the bank\u2019s helpline and complain about the debit. As a result, the entire sum would be \u2018refunded\u2019 in their account. Navas said the duo managed 13 such frauds in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Tamil Nadu since June 10. The details are being compiled, said police. Sources said that though the attempt at Kalvathy failed, the accused claim they had executed one such fraud in city. Police said that a bank official had informed that this method was not possible. \u201cThe bank official told us that there is a way to switch off the ATM at the time of dispensation of cash and he suggested that the fraudsters might have used such an option. In this way they could convince the bank that notes were not dispensed owing to a system failure and demand refund,\u201d said Navas, adding that the accused were sticking to their version. A demo with expert technicians will be held to see how exactly the fraud happens, he said. \u201cThe accused claimed that their technique works in the ATMs manufactured by a certain company. We will be interrogating the accused further to know the truth. Anyway, their accounts received money lately,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, a senior banker, on condition of anonymity, said that fraud \u2013 as described by the accused \u2013 could be done. \u201cThis has happened before. At least, some old machines are still prone to this problem. If such a claim is made and fund is not transferred, bank would have to pay a penalty of Rs 100/day. So, most banks credit the sum right away. Once an enquiry reveals the truth, it would be too late,\u201d he said.

According to those opposing the sudden decision to sign the PPA, it is unfair from the part of authorities to sign such an agreement when the project has not even received the crucial Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) clearance. As per a communique from KSEB, the power utility will sign the PPA with the private firm in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. \u201cThe PPA should be signed only after the project gets EIA nod. We don\u2019t understand why KSEB is signing the agreement in a hurry,\u201d said Kerala electricity workers federation state secretary Jacob Lazar. \u201cThere are many instances in which the KSEB ended up making losses after signing such agreements without considering the consequences. KSEB is still paying fixed charges to National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) though the agency has stopped purchasing power from the Kayamkulam plant. As per the agreement with NTPC, KSEB should pay fixed charges even if it doesn\u2019t purchase electricity from the firm. Similarly, KSEB had to pay fixed charges to a private firm at Eloor despite no electricity was purchased from them,\u201d Lazar said. According to experts in the field of energy and zero waste system, the agreement is being signed in a hurry only to protect the vested interests of certain officials. \u201cThe undue haste shown in signing the PPA points to the possibilities of corruption. Breaching the laws first and then getting it rectified has become an order of the day, especially in the case of the state government,\u201d said Zero Waste Systems consultant Shibu K N. \u201cSome of the top officials are behind the move. Their aim is to constitute a waste to energy management authority and place themselves at the top of the body,\u201d Shibu said. Meanwhile, officials with GJ Eco Power Private Limited said the decision to sign the PPA was taken before the general elections. \u201cJust a formal signing of the agreement is happening on Tuesday. There is nothing illegal or unfair in this,\u201d said an official with the firm. \u201cThe project would soon get EIA clearance. We have completed the public hearing as part of the EIA clearance. Now, we will be sending the details of the public hearing, including the audio and video clips, to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA),\u201d the official said.

The petition (WP-C No. 16711/2019) was filed by Ranjit Karthikeyan of Vanchiyoor in Thiruvananthapuram, who is a chartered accountant, by alleging that the steps taken for issuing the bonds under Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Act of 1999 violates Article 293(1), which stipulates that state governments are allowed to borrow only within the country. A counsel representing the petitioner sought to withdraw the petition after a division bench comprising chief justice Hrishikesh Roy and justice AK Jayasankaran Nambiar pointed out that the investment is being canvassed not by the state government but by Kerala Infrastructure Investment Board (KIIB). The petitioner has no case that security offered is against the consolidated fund of the state, the court said. While withdrawing the plea, the counsel also sought permission to file a fresh one, if so advised, after collecting necessary information. While dismissing the case as not pressed, the court has reserved the liberty of the petitioner to approach the court again. It was contended by the petitioner that KIIB is a statutory body and a \u2018State\u2019 and is therefore bound by Article 293(1). A plain reading of the article makes it clear that KIIB violated it by issuing rupee-denominated bonds to overseas investors. Executive power of the state extends to borrowings only within India and borrowing from overseas investors, even in rupee-denominated bonds, has not been envisaged or provided for by the Constitution, the petition had stated. Issuing of Masala Bonds to overseas investors is illegal, arbitrary, and unreasonable and violates Article 14 (equality before law), 19 (right to freedom), and 21 (right to life and liberty) of the Constitution, the petitioner had argued while stating that any act of the government must be reasonable and should be towards public interest. The high rate of interest of 9.723% puts a burden on the public exchequer, thus compromising public interest, it was alleged.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Addressing a news meet here, Alfa Serene Apartment Owners\u2019 Association said the 1996 map was so crude that it was difficult to identify a place. \u201cIt is unlike the map prepared in 2012 by Maradu municipality, in which the building and CR zones can be clearly identified by the survey numbers,\u201d said association president Rasheed Usman.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing. Living with the dead: A grave in the backyard\"All we are asking for is some land for our ancestors. There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar. Their burial grounds are filled to capacity,\" said Nizam Khan, a mechanic. Village pradhan Sundar Kumar said that he had asked officials several times for a burial ground for Muslim families, but no action was taken. Ravi Kumar NG, the district magistrate, said that he was not aware of the issue. \"I will send an official team to the village and get details of the burial land required.\" Picture Credit: Hemant Kumar In Video:Houses turn into graveyards as Muslims in this UP village bury the dead at homeDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Ashton Kutcher": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/hollywood/news/ashton-kutcher-and-mila-kunis-trash-split-rumours-in-the-funniest-way-possible/articleshow/69868560.cms", "description": ""}, "2 held for ATM fraud in Kochi": {"description": "KOCHI: In a case of suspected ATM fraud, two persons were taken into custody by Mattancherry police after a guard saw them sticking a piece of paper around a CCTV camera.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai.

The event was held under the guidance of Pooyam Tirunal Gouri Parvathi Bayi, who is the OSA secretary. \u201cThe show is held every two years. The 87 members who were part of this show were of different ages and from all walks of life. We had grandmothers and mothers alongside granddaughters and daughters. It was hard work but fun too. Our dance director Aswathy Nair worked tirelessly to ensure seamless production and Ambili Ramnath\u2019s expertise with words and Kavalam Sreekumar\u2019s magic with the music have always been the mainstay of our performances,\u201d she says. Apart from performing, for Gouri Parvathi Bayi, it is also an event to meet her friends and teachers. \u201cI have never really left the Women\u2019s College - as a student, teacher and as part of the Alumni association, I have always remained in touch with the institution. For most of us, there is a sense of homecoming when we step into the college compound. The years fall away, and we feel rejuvenated. Ultimately in life, our real earnings are the friendships we have forged, the wonderful experiences nobody can take away from us and precious memories that stay with us always. Many of our older members make it a point to come to our meetings and events. They make a greater physical effort than youngsters who work a full day and have homes to run too,\u201d she adds. Actress Sona Nair was also part of the event, enthralling her friends in her avatar as goddess Saraswati. \u201cThis is an event that I eagerly look forward to. I feel blessed meeting my old teachers and classmates, and giving me memories to cherish for the next two years. Each of the 87 artistes were given a three-and-half-minute performance and so that ensured everyone had equal time to perform,\u201d she says, adding that she always makes it a point to find time amid her shooting schedules to make it to the reunion.

The situation has changed as the extraordinary gazette notifications are now available online. Advocates and government officials who needed a copy of the notifications had to make a trip to the high court, office of the advocate general, assembly secretariat or the state central library. A copy of the gazette would also be with the government departments which publish them. That was it. While the state\u2019s ordinary gazette, a public journal and an authorized legal document published every week by the department of printing and stationary, is available online from 2007 onwards, the publishing of extraordinary gazette to online space marks a significant shift in government approach. Officials and judiciary depend a lot on extraordinary gazette notifications and now they will have them at their fingertips as certified digital documents with legal validity. Jacob George, a faculty with National University of Advanced Legal Studies who had campaigned for such a facility, said this would be of immense use to legal fraternity. \u201cIt was hard to find extraordinary gazette notifications all at one place. While there are some teething issues this would be beneficial as it would increase the transparency,\u201d he said. Printing department director Muraleedharan said government departments would be able to directly upload templates of the required notification, which would be published online with digital signatures. \u201cPage length of extraordinary gazette may vary from one to many. It used to be printed as required,\u201d he said. They would be published exclusively online henceforth. Sources in the department said the ordinary gazette currently available at egazette.kerala.gov.in does not have legal validity. The ordinary gazette would also shift to a similar mode when all digital publishing modules are launched in another two months. While the extraordinary gazette has no bearing on general public, once the ordinary gazette notifications became available online as certified documents, public would benefit from it.

The statement given to security agencies in December 2018 by a Keralite, who was deported from Qatar for suspected terror links in 2015, says that some of those arrested by the NIA in Coimbatore regularly interacted with their Kerala counterparts. The Malayali, who hails from Palakkad, was deported from Qatar for allegedly trying to migrate to Syria to join Jabhat Al-Nusra, a terror outfit, in 2013. The NIA had in January 2019 registered a case against a group of youths for alleged terror links. The youth in question is among this \u2018group\u2019 and is currently under surveillance. He is likely to turn approver, it is learnt. He had told his interrogators earlier that one of the accused in the Coimbatore case was his Facebook friend. He had added that 30 persons, including Malayalis, were members of a WhatsApp group created by the Coimbatore module. The Malayali had said that, during a visit to India in 2014, he had visited Coimbatore to meet the members of the IS module there. Members from various muslim outfits petitioned Coimbatore Police Comissioner related to NIA search in Ukkadam.After deportation in 2015, he again met some of the members of the Coimbatore module and handed over money to them, who in return handed over copies of a book they published. According to him, the Al-Nusra module in Qatar included Thaha Muhammad, a Karnataka-native born and brought up in Qatar; Sultan, hailing from Kozhikode; Rijaz Aboobacker, Thrissur native but settled in Qatar; Irafan, a native of Mahe and Siddique, hailing from Kozhikode. They were radicalized by one Hashir, a native of Paravoor, who was already radicalized through the speeches Anwar Al-Awlaki, the Salafi preacher who was killed in a US drone attack in Afghanistan and Abdulla Yusuf Azzam, one of the founding members of Al Qaeda. Some in the group left for Syria via Turkey to join Al-Nusra but two of them had returned to India. Hashir and Irfan, who arrived in Syria, used to regularly contact those who did not migrate and had sent photographs from that country. The Kerala Al Nusra group had contacts with Yahya alias Bestin and Easa alias Bexton, the natives of Palakkad who migrated to the Islamic State strongholds in Afghanistan. Shias, the youth from Kasaragod who migrated to Afghanistan, was also a part of the gang. Abdul Rashid Abdulla, the leader of the Kerala IS module, also maintained contacts with the group. The statement by the Malayali confirmed the suspicion that Keralites had migrated to Syria even before the official formation of the Islamic State in 2014. There were reports that one Abu Tahir, a native of Palakkad who had gone to Syria in 2013, was killed in battle. He also had joined Al Nusra, the splinter organisation of the Al Qaeda formed in 2012 to fight the Syrian government.

He issued the order after hearing an appeal filed by office-bearers of the club, challenging the orders issued by the additional tahsildar and Fort Kochi\u2019s subcollector to recover the said land on Warriam Road. In an order issued on February 2, 2010 under Kerala Land Conservancy Act, the additional tahsildar said that the club has occupied puramboke land as per revenue records. Since it exists on encroached land, it should be vacated. The club secured a stay on the order and approached the Ernakulam sub court and filed a revision petition before revenue authorities citing that the land was given by the king of erstwhile kingdom of Kochi. But, nothing went in their favour. Club authorities then approached Fort Kochi subcollector, who is the appellate authority, to challenge the order. But the sub-collector\u2014in his order in April 2018 \u2014 upheld the order of the additional tahsildar. As per the basic tax register and puramboke register, 80.25 cents in the survey number 740/2 of Ernakulam village in Kanayannur taluk is government land and it was encroached by the club, the sub-collector said. Then, the club moved the high court which ordered the district collector to hear the review petition filed by the club and issue an appropriate order. Based on the court order, Safirulla considered the matter and found that the club lacked documents to prove the ownership of the land. The club claimed that the erstwhile kingdom had even granted timber for the construction of the club house. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the order issued by the district collector.

The contractor alleged that the procurement of sand for filling the geotubes was not the part of contract that was entered with the department. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the irrigation department to provide the necessary permissions, locate sand and avail sand. The department failed in this, which led to stoppage of the work,\u201d said the contractor. \u201cIrrigation department officials are passing the buck to hide their mistakes. As we had mobilized the manpower, machineries, equipment and geotube materials at site after receiving work order from the department on September 10, 2018, we faced loss of time and money. The scarcity of sand was intimated to the irrigation department several times and dredging is not possible from sea near to the site due to the silt and clay accumulated in the sea up to a greater depth. Availing sand is the prime responsibility of tender issuing department, but now they say that it is the responsibility of the contractor to source sand from anywhere,\u201d said K P Shajeel, supervisor of the project and staff of contractor Mohammed Niyas. Meanwhile, irrigation department executive engineer K Radhakrishnan said that sand was available in the sea and had to be dredged out by the contractor. \u201cThe contractor lacks the equipment to dredge out the sand and it is affecting the work which need to be completed at a fast pace. As he failed to meet the tender condition, the department had to initiate termination of contract,\u201d he said.

A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

But inside the hall at a trendy restaurant in Kochi, the atmosphere is heating up with talk of sex. It is a poetry evening, called Un-taboo, and a mixed crowd is talking about their bodies, love, loss, sexuality and abuse. \u201c\u2019Steady girl, take it slow\u2019,\u201d starts Sumi Thomas, as she reads her poem on lovemaking. \u201c... \u2018A little part of me laughs at the nerd that I am, the rest of me is burning with desire and cares not for correctness.\u2019\u201d Even if it is a small group which has pre-registered for the event, it is stunning to see that the wife and mother of two, albeit a media professional, doesn\u2019t mince or hold back her words and builds up her poem to a sexual and emotional crescendo. And a few others follow suit, attracting applause and drawn breaths in a couple of cases with the boldness of their words. Are women in conservative Kerala okay with expressing their feelings on their bodies and about sex openly? Sumi says, \u201cI know this poem is not exactly Kamala Das, but I posted it online because I felt I had to let out my voice for myself and my daughters.\u201d Anna Varghese Puthuran, a High Court lawyer who has worked with an NGO that works with building a new life for sexually abused women and children, says, \u201cI feel women need to reclaim spaces. This conversation has to be had. For how long can we run away from topics like this? I was always told off for writing explicitly and was told to write about pretty things, but it is important to go back to your authentic self whatever that might be. And maybe people are also more ready to accept women\u2019s voices now.\u201d And if they are not, don\u2019t feel bogged down by judgment, the women say. Lola hails from Kumbalam, a village on the backwaters of Kochi, but is today a globe-trotting artist. An exhibition she is planning this year in Kochi has vagina as its theme. The artist, who \u201cloves to draw and take pictures of nudes\u201d, says the worst comments come from people close to her family, but she gets about 30 messages every day from strangers admiring her work. But, even for an artist who posts pictures of herself in very revealing clothes on social media, there is a self-monitoring that takes place. \u201cSome days I\u2019m brave and some days I\u2019m not, but some posts can be an inspiration for others. If I\u2019m craving to do this so much, other women must be too; so why restrict their voices?\u201d she asks. As for her exhibition, she says Kochi is ready for it, because \u201cit\u2019s not sexual, it\u2019s art\u201d.  Sumi, who is now writing a short story \u2018with a lot of erotic elements\u2019, says, \u201cIf people judge my character based on what I write, it does not matter to me. All writing comes from some connection you feel to the stories that you are telling. I will write what I feel like writing.\u201d Lidiya Prasad, a copywriter, who moved to Kochi from Bengaluru, felt life here would be staid and culturally low-key, so she was happy to take part in an earlier adult poetry session. She recently published a book of her \u201cvery explicit and more low-key\u201d poems, and says, \u201cIt is not about rebelling, but people have to think of women beyond the good-girl and virgin labels. But funnily enough, though there are poems in my book which deals with other subjects, people only want to talk about the erotic stuff.\u201d  Women feel that there are inevitably several men who felt their words were an \u201cinvitation to casual sex\u201d. \u201cInitially, I used to cry thinking I invited this behaviour from men, but now I\u2019ve learnt that it is a problem they must deal with,\u201d says Lidiya.  Their families are a mix of understanding, encouraging and embarrassed. While the women are sometimes conscious that they must not post things that would embarrass their families, Anna says, \u201cOur relationships with our family get more mature as we age, and they become more respectful of our voice.\u201d  Jayakrishnan Pillai, whose media company organised the Un-taboo event, which was advertised on social media, says he received a call from an elderly man in Kozhikode congratulating them for holding the event, which he said was much-needed in our society. \u201cThis poetry event was a solution to the whole idea that women cannot express themselves freely on social media without attracting sexual and annoying comments from people. This was a chance to meet like-minded people and share thoughts without being questioned,\u201d he says. Apart from social media blurring the borders on what privacy mean, even a movement like the Kudumbashree has given women the opportunity to be outgoing, says activist Rekha Raj. She explains that at gender workshops, she meets lots of youngsters who question why their privacy is curtailed and just hang out and do the things they want to. \u201cEven the conversations in our homes are changing and families are discussing the idea of sexuality, thanks to the issues and the calls for rights in the queer movement. This is a positive change; it is probably reflecting quite slowly in society, but it is happening,\u201d she says.

There are more than 21,500 marine fishing vessels operating in the Kerala waters, of which more than 4,000 vessels are mechanized and another 11,000 accounts for motorized vessels. Studies by the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology have shown that energy efficient fishing systems including changes in the vessels, engine horsepower, gear and operations could reduce the carbon emissions. Fisheries scientists who have been working on sustainable fishing technology said that vessel design, construction and operation fishing gear and methods, adoption of advanced technology and fleet management conservation, management and enhancement of resources were the key. \u201cAcross the world studies have calculated the carbon footprint of major fish harvesting systems like trawling, purse seining, gillnetting and long lining. For example, in trawling, the global warming potential is 5.43 per kilo of fish caught,\u201d said Leela Edwin, head, department of fishing technology, CIFT. According to a series of studies by the CIFT scientists including Leela Edwin, Dhiju Das and Renju Ravi under a project on green fishing systems for tropical seas, fisheries in India consume as much as 1378.8 million litres of fuel and releases 3.13 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. The energy use in fishing begins from going to and from the fishing ground, dropping the nets, the fishing method, processing and transporting to consumer and this was calculated under the life cycle assessment of the individual fishing units. \u201cCIFT has worked with the Kerala government to fix optimum limits for boat engines and fishing gears. This along with other standards for the materials will ensure that we will be able to reduce the energy consumption in the fisheries sector. This will help in the usage of sustainable gear for the fishing sector and this is now being implemented in this sector,\u201d Leela Edwin said. Fishing vessel hull optimization, reduction of engine rpm, periodic maintenance of hull and replacement of two-stroke petrol engine to the inboard diesel engine is recommended to reduce the environmental impact related to the fishing operation. Use of high durable alternative webbing materials and appropriate use of lead sinkers will increase the life of gear and reduce environmental impacts.

This is following the information collected from some of the accused in recent cases who said that some of the medical shops are assisting smugglers. \u201cThe top narcotic secret group of Ernakulam excise division has been gathering intelligence about the drug suppliers in the city and found that ganja and Nitrazepam tablets are easily available for students, especially those studying in higher secondary level. On Tuesday, we arrested one such supplier after the details collected from a high school student, who underwent counselling at the excise Vimukthi counselling centre when his parents found ganja packet in his schoolbag. Drug menace among students is a major challenge that needs to be checked,\u201d said Palan. The official also said that excise officials would be part of parent-teacher meetings in schools in the district. \u201cThe School Protection Groups are already associating with excise to help counsel student and gather information,\u201d Palan said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

With the success of the first solar passenger boat, the water transport department is all set to launch three more boats in the coming months. \u201cAditya, our first solar boat has been running successfully for the last two years and not a trip has been cancelled. The fuel costs have just been Rs 200-280 for electricity and we have saved about Rs 48 lakhs on diesel,\u201d said SWTD director Shaji Nair. Three of the boats including a cruise-liner will become operational in the next few months. The tendering process for the construction of another three boats will begin by the end of this year. Nair said that in contrast to the huge criticism and pressure that the department faced for venturing into solar-powered boats, Aditya is drawing international attention too. \u201cWe had senior officials from almost 40 countries visiting us recently to travel in the boat. They were part of the International solar alliance (ISA) and had come to look at the boat so that it could be replicated and customized in their countries,\u201d he said. Of the two new boats under construction at NavAlt, one will be a return boat in the Vaikkom- Thavanakadavu route while the other would be in the Panavally-Thiruvananthapuram route. The cruise-liner will be an air-conditioned, double-decker boat and deployed in Alappuzha for \u2018See Kuttanad\u2019 programme. These boats will be powered by a hybrid battery. \u201cDuring day time, we will use solar power and at night battery power,\u201d Nair said. The first solar boat, Aditya, has completed two years of service in January. During the period, the boat carried 6, 00,000 passengers and travelled around 38,000 km without a single drop of fuel thereby saving 58,000 litres of diesel. This saved Rs 45 lakhs in diesel and maintenance cost during the period. Sandith Thandasherry, the man behind India\u2019s first solar-powered ferry and CEO of NavAlt Solar and Electric Boats said that all countries in the tropical area were interested in the solar boats and the delegation which visited Aditya was in discussions with his company for manufacturing solar boats. He said that the ISA had offered to try to aggregate the combined demand the requirement of the countries as Aditya was a successful model of a public transport with a capacity of carrying 100 passengers. The Inland Waterways Authority of India has also evinced interest in running solar boats in the Ganga and Yamuna. \u201cThey have called for tenders for the Yamuna taxi and have kept very high technical standards,\u201d Sandith said. Meanwhile, Kochi Metro\u2019s water project is already looking at solar boats. Also, Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) is also looking at a solar-powered boat which is intended to be operated in the inland waterways.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination. His late grandfather, Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, was long associated with the Congress. | Full coverage of Lok Sabha elections in MaharashtraAmong other prominent leaders from Maharashtra in the first list of candidates are Union minister Nitin Gadkari from his hometown Nagpur, state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve from Jalna, Union MoS Hansraj Ahir from Chandrapur and Union MoS for defence Subash Bhamre from Dhule. Late BJP MP Gopinath Munde\u2019s daughter, Pritam, who was elected to Parliament with a record majority after her father\u2019s death, has been renominated from Beed. Sitting MP from Sangli Sanjay Patil has also been renominated, putting an end to speculation over any change in constituency. Patil\u2019s candidature was opposed by a section of BJP leaders in Sangli. However, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is understood to have called a meeting of local party leaders and resolved the differences.

Following this, around 728kg of sandalwood pieces, from the biggest sandal seizures reported in Andhra Pradesh, had to be handed over to the AP forest officials for safe custody and the Kerala team had to return empty-handed. The officers include Munnar divisional forest officer (DFO) Narendrababu, Marayoor DFO B Ranjit and Marayoor range officer Job J Neriamparampil. According to sources, the team reached Andhra Pradesh on Sunday evening along with Shuhaib alias Kunajappa (36) of Pookkotur in Malappuram, the kingpin of the inter-state smuggling gang, who was arrested on Wednesday night. The operation was part of collecting evidences, based on the information extracted from Shuhaib who had reportedly smuggled more than 20,000kg of sandalwood from Kerala to Andhra Pradesh, of which nearly 10,000kg was sold to the said factory. An officer in the team said they had taken all requisite permission from the state government and given prior intimation to the Andhra forest department while maintaining the confidential nature of the operation. The team, after cordoning off the factory area on Sunday night, started the raid around 5am which continued to till 1pm on Monday. \u201cAfter the raid, while we were loading the sandalwood pieces on to a truck, AP forest officials arrived in a jeep and told us that we cannot take the items with us until we followed proper legal procedures.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

Around 50 cents were recovered through the drive. However, 12 years later, the revenue department doesn't have any detail about the land recovered at an area that has high land value, shows an RTI reply. Not only that, many of the land parcels that were evicted during the drive has been encroached on again. In a reply to an RTI query submitted by T N Prathapan of Thammanam, Ernakulam village officer stated that the details regarding the land parcels which were recovered through an eviction in 2007 were not available at the village office. \u201cAs this office doesn\u2019t have a file system, details regarding the eviction had not been codified and kept in the office,\u201d the reply by the village officer stated. When contacted, the village officer gave the same answer. Following this, Prathapan has filed an appeal before Kanayannoor Tahsildar. In the reply, the taluk officials said that he would get a reply from Ernakulam village office in a couple of days. Ernakulam Vikasana Samathi, a forum for the development of the city, has demanded that the authorities should take measures for protecting the land. \u201cRecently, a cent on MG Road has been sold at Rs 2 crore. At least 50 cents of land had been recovered through the eviction drive in 2007. Given the value of land in the area, assets running into crores of rupees are being alienated,\u201d said K S Dileep Kumar, president, Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi. \u201cThe corporation should construct compound walls for protecting the holdings from encroachment,\u201d he said. In many areas, the evicted areas are being encroached again. \u201cRecently, a shop owner near Jayalakshmi Silks paved concrete tiles on the poramboke, which was seized from encroachers during 2007 drive. They extended the tile pavement in front of their shop to the poramboke land. When we raised an objection, the corporation removed the tiles from the government land. But this is not an isolated incident,\u201d said Dileep Kumar. \u201cA shopping complex has claimed right of way through the land in front of their building. When the corporation tried to recover the land, the building owners moved court,\u201d said Sudha Dileep Kumar, councillor, Kochi Corporation. Once the land parcels are recovered from the encroachers, it can be used for purposes like constructing bus bays. This will avoid traffic snarls as well as accidents.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Dilapidated footpath at Ekm.": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/dilapidatedfootpathatekm-/articleshow/69657765.cms", "description": ""}, "Ishaan Khatter": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/did-ishaan-khatter-refuse-the-role-opposite-ayushmann-khurrana/videoshow/69864397.cms", "description": ""}, "Charlie: 100 Days celebration": {"time": "", "link": "http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/events/kerala/charlie-100-days-celebration/articleshow/51952851.cms", "description": ""}}
