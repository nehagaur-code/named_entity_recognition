A surprise pick by the ruling BJP-led NDA   , Birla's name was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself for the post, sources said. The 56-year-old leader is considered to be close to both Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah. Birla's nomination for the Lok Sabha Speaker's post also has the   backing of non-NDA parties   such as the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). Starting his political journey as a student leader, Birla was also elected to the Rajasthan Assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. He won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was again elected this year from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. Birla defeated Congress's Ramnarayan Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently-concluded general election. A conscientious parliamentarian, Birla has registered an 86-per cent average attendance in the House, asked 671 questions, participated in 163 debates and introduced six private members' bills in the 16th Lok Sabha. From 1991 to 2003, he was a key leader in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) as a state-level president first and then, as a vice-president at the national level. Birla, who holds a Masters degree in commerce, is a member of the Standing Committee on Energy in Parliament, the Committee on Petitions and the Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. He succeeds eight-time MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Lok Sabha Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this is not the first time that a relative newcomer has occupied the position. In 1996, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader G M C Balayogi, also a two-time MP then, was elected as the Speaker in the Lower House of Parliament. After his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

It advised that visa should be applied only through proper channel by visiting the official government of Canada website. Thousands of students every year apply for visa by paying hefty fees. Apart from them, thousands of Indians, especially Punjabis, apply for the Canada visa.

According to a rough estimate, over one lakh students are expected to go to Canada in 2019. Immigrating to Canada has been a craze among Punjabis.

He said Kolkata incident had forced him to rethink over his hospital\u2019s security. \u201cPresently we have just around half a dozen unarmed guards but now I am thinking to hire private security\" said he adding that Nursing Homes cell of IMA, Amritsar was holding a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issue in detail. Director, Cardiology, Fortis hospital Dr Arun Chopra observed that the violence against doctors was on rise especially in past couple of years. He said they had around 35 to 40 unarmed security personals out of which only about 12 to 15 were present in the hospital at any given time. \u201cBut they are insufficient to handle a frenzied mob of even fifty persons\u201d he said. The Kolkata incident had rejuvenated their worst fears about their own and their family\u2019s security, he added. He also agreed that if government failed to provide security cover to doctors they would be left with no option but to hire their own private security. The Times of India on Sunday visited a few private hospitals to find private security guards deployed at various places in plain clothes, even a few posing as patients, doctors practising with their licensed weapons. Doctors were collectively of view that poor infrastructure in government hospitals often forces patients to rush to private hospitals and many of them were not able to bear the high cost of treatment and in case of patient\u2019s death of a patient, the kins didn\u2019t wish to pay the pending bills and start blaming doctors for their negligence. \u201cOften these kind of people are sheltered by some local politicians who instigate them to stage dharna against the hospital and mount pressure on the hospital management to waive off their remaining bill\u201d said a doctor who didn\u2019t wish to give his name. Managing director Medicity, Dr Avtar Singh observed that private hospitals were in unorganised sector so they were vulnerable to violence. \u201cWhen I started my hospital, I was advised to have security in the hospital but I denied but now I realise that I need security\" said he adding that even the aggression in the society had increased over the years. Avtar who has his own private security said that the guards not only regulate the traffic of patients but also keep an eye on the behavioural pattern of relatives of a patient and warns the hospital staff accordingly. While justifying having bouncers by the doctors, he opined that first and the foremost reason behind attack on doctors and hospital was payment of bills. \"When it comes on paying the bill, they get hold of a local politician who instigate them for dharna etc. this has happened with us at Medicity about six months ago\u201d said he while suggesting that government had to make stringent of the rules and declare violence against doctors as a non bailable. Meanwhile president IMA, Amritsar Dr Inderbir Singh Nizzar informed that a complete shout down would be observed on Monday. \u201cThere will be no OPD or elective surgeries but emergency services will continue\u201d, he said. He informed that IMA had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggesting that a multifaceted approach encompassing the areas of legislation, security, data collection, training and public awareness was required to successfully address the issue of violence on health sector.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing. Living with the dead: A grave in the backyard\"All we are asking for is some land for our ancestors. There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar. Their burial grounds are filled to capacity,\" said Nizam Khan, a mechanic. Village pradhan Sundar Kumar said that he had asked officials several times for a burial ground for Muslim families, but no action was taken.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The NDRF is the premier body for rescue and relief operations in case of calamities, manmade and nature, in the country. NDRF 7th Battalion commandant Ravi Kumar told TOI on Tuesday that the operation to retrieve Fatehveer, who died after being rescued from borewell after five days, could not termed a \u201cfailed operation\u201d. \u201cThough NDRF does not have much expertise in handling such situations (of retrieving a baby from a borewell), we did our best. Central agencies do not leave anything to chance and we too made sincere efforts, though without success. We don\u2019t blame anybody or ourselves; it is only the circumstances which came in the way of the operation,\u201d he said. The operation to rescue Fatehveer has been criticized over the direction of a parallel pit, which was dug to pull out the boy, changing. Before this, the NDRF\u2019s 7th Batallion, which is headquartered in Bathinda, had faced only one incident in which a child had fallen in a borewell. Kumar said the NDRF would analyse the shortcomings of the operation, if any, to find out how standard operating procedure for such situations could be improved. Kumar refuted allegations that the NDRF team did not even have a compass to know the exact direction for digging the parallel put. He said the team was \u201cfully-equipped and compasses were present even in mobile phones\u201d. Two assistant commandants of NDRF supervised the operation running over 5 days, with a team of 25 jawans. Kumar said that NDRF got information about the incident in the evening of June 6 and the team had reached Bhagwanpura village near Sunam by 7pm. He said the operation was \u201cvery tricky\u201d. \u201cOur assistant commandant Ajay Verma remained concentrated on the operation for four days and only then we sent the other team led by another assistant commandant, Om Parkash Bishnoi, to provide some rest to the first team,\u201d the commandant added. \u201cEarlier, our men tried to pull the boy by a rope. But, when all such efforts did not bear fruit, we decided to dig a parallel bore with the full consent of district administration, family and those present,\u201d he added. The commandant said the direction of the second bore changed as the soil was sandy. He, however, dismissed rumours that the NDRF was not given full freedom and Dera Sacha Sauda volunteers and villagers obstructed them. Kumar fell back on the adage \u201cprevention is better than cure\u201d. \u201cWe need to take care that unmanned borewells are plugged to avoid another such incident,\u201d he said. \u2018Borewell narrower where kid was stuck\u2019Assistant commandant Ajay Verma, who commanded the operation for four days, said the borewell had a nine-inch diameter at the mouth, but it narrowed down to six inches where the bot was stuck. \u201cHe was entangled so badly that only his hands were visible. On the very first day, we tried to pull him out with a rope, but there was no vacuum to hold him. We tried to pull him from hands, but that was unsuccessful too. The parallel pit was dug to extract from the other side, but that too not worked well either and only created vacuum to pull him from the main bore,\u201d he said.

About 11am, he came along some accomplices and barged into our home. He dragged my daughter out of the house and started beating her up. They also abused her and did not spare me when I went to save her,\u201d she said. She said their entire family was of labourers. \u201cWe would not have taken the loan from them if we would have known they were so ruthless,\u201d she said. SSP Dhesi said Suresh Chaudhary and his accomplices Roop Lal, Sunny Chaudhary, Guddi, Sekhu and Jebo had been charged with sections 307 (attempt to murder), 452 (house trespass), 354(assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \u201cEfforts are being made to arrest others involved in the incident, including the councillor,\u201d he said.

One such measures at sustainable water management is its latest attempt at promoting drip irrigation in maize crop. The state agriculture and farmer welfare department has fixed a target for sowing maize: 1.50 lakh hectare. A pilot project of micro irrigation on maize crop will be taken up in 1,000 acre this season under state government\u2019s ambitious project Tandrust Punjab. Maize sowing had been on decline in Punjab over the years. The reason why the state government has fixed a target to increase acreage under maize in Punjab. In 2012-13 and 2013-14, the maize was sown in 1.31 lakh hectare, in 2014-15 it was 1.26 lakh hectare, in 2015-16 1.27 lakh, in 2016-17 1.16 lakh and in 2017-18 the maize was sown in 1.14 lakh hectare with production of 4.10 lakh metric tonne. This season\u2019s production target stands at 5.70 lakh tonne. Mission director of Tandrust Punjab, KS Pannu, who is also secretary Punjab agriculture, said, \u201cOut of 1,000 acre of maize under drip irrigation, 900 acre will be on surface drip system and 100 acre will be sub-surface drip system. Four micro irrigation companies will demonstrate drip irrigation on an area of 10 acre each to show farmers how water can be conserved through drip irrigation and also to prevail them upon to adopt the drip irrigation system.\u201d Pannu said that department officials have been directed to promote alternative methods of crop watering in the wake of serious water resource challenge the state is likely to face in the coming years. According to soil conservation officials, drip irrigation not only conserves water but it also increases yield. Experts from Punjab Agricultural University said that they have successfully conducted experiments of sub-surface drip irrigation system on maize, wheat and moong and that it should be promoted on mass scale. It is to be mentioned here that a pilot campaign of micro irrigation on cotton was also undertaken this season by soil conservation department, under which 200 acre of cotton crop has been brought under drip irrigation.

The hardliners did not pay heed to the Akal Takht\u2019s directions to Sikh individuals and bodies to not indulge in any kind of hooliganism or create ruckus in Darbar Sahib complex on the day when all would be remembering and paying homage to the persons who were killed in the Army action aimed at flushing out armed militants from the Golden Temple complex in 1984. Groups brandish swords inside the Golden Temple complex on ThursdayThousands of devotees early in the morning thronged the Akal Takht to attend the \u2018bhog\u2019 ceremony of religious prayers that began on June 4. Security agencies were put on high alert in and around this city in viewo f the anniversary. A day ahead of the anniversary, the Akal Takht acting jathedar said Parliament shoulda ccept that the attack carried out on the directions of the Indian government was a blunder and should submit an official apology for it. \u201cThe Indian Parliament should bring \u2018maafi da matta\u2019 (an apology resolution) for the execution of Ghallughara (Operation Bluestar) in 1984,\u201d he said in a statement. As against previous years, the SGPC tactfully restricted the Khalistani exponent Simranjit Singh Mann to a corner from where he delivered his speech exhorting Sikhs to struggle for Khalistan. Other pro-Khalistani groups, largely made up of adolescents, kept on raising slogans and struggling with task force to reach close to the Akal Takht. And in the melee, turbans of few were tossed while a few tried to jump over the barricades, and failed to do so, simply uprooted the blockades laid by SGPC. As a group of radicalised youth tried to overpower the SGPC\u2019s human chain barrier, a couple of task force members already equipped with bundle of lathis distributed these among other members of task force to deal with the situation. The situation also turned tense when parallel acting jathedar of Akal Takht Dhian Singh Mand not allowed to deliver his message intially. However, many police personnels in plain clothes were seen pacifying the agitated Sikh radicals. Later, Mand\u2019s supporters distributed his message among mediapersons. Similarly, another group read out the message of parallel jathedar of Akal Takht Jagtar Singh Hawara, assassin of former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh who is lodged in Tihar jail at present. Many Khalistani elements were carrying posters having pictures of militant leader Jarnail Singh Bhinderanwala and were wearing T shirts with his photographs and AK-47 rifles.

Meanwhile, arguments could not take place in the court of additional district and session judge Harbans Singh Neki on the anticipatory bail application of then DSP Baljit Singh and the matter was adjourned to June 12. The court, on June 6, had accepted the anticipatory bail of Pannu but rejected the anticipatory bail of Pandher. The special investigations team (SIT) had on May 28 filed the chargesheet in Kotkapura police firing case in court against five policemen and ex-MLA Mantar Singh Brar. The charges, including attempt to murder, had been filed against then Ludhiana police commissioner Umranangal, ex-SSP Sharma, Pannu, Baljit Singh, Pandher and Brar. The role of ex-chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, ex-deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal, ex-DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and then DIG Amar Singh Chahal is also being investigated in the case. After the Bargari sacrilege incident on October 12, 2015 protesters had assembled at an intersection in Kotkapura on October 13 and police had resorted to lathicharge, use of water canons and tear gas shells on protesters in the wee hours of October 14. Cops had even fired bullets. Many protesters had sustained injuries, including one Ajit Singh who took a bullet in the leg. According to the chargesheet, Umranagal had called the then SSP and the ADCP to Kotkapura. Earlier, SAD had accused SIT member IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh of continuing to work in the SIT despite orders by the Election Commission to spare him (from SIT) till the code of conduct for parliamentary elections was in place. SAD had accused the IG of signing the chargesheet on May 23, days before the code of conduct was lifted on May 26. In a Facebook post on June 7, IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh had termed the chargesheet \u201cof international standard, not very common in India. We can see such charge-sheets in the USA and UK and in some cases in France and Germany also\u201d. Faridkot district attorney Rajneesh Goyal said the hearing on chargesheet was adjourned as Umranangal and Charanjit Sharma had sent medical certificates to explain their inability to appear before the court.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar.

The Indian Medical Association (IMA) announced a nationwide strike on Monday to express solidarity with the victim doctors. \u201cWe are already working under constant fear and this recent incident has only aggravated our anxiety. The government has to come up with stringent laws, so that exemplary punishments are given to persons attacking doctors and ransacking hospitals,\u201d said Dr Hartej Singh Nagpal, who runs the 100-bedded Hartej Hospital, while talking to TOI on Sunday. He said the Kolkata incident had forced him to rethink over his hospital\u2019s security. \u201cAt present, we have just around half a dozen unarmed guards, but now I am thinking to hire private security,\u201d he saud, adding that the nursing homes cell of IMA\u2019s Amritsar chapter was holding a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issue in detail. Fortis Hospital director (cardiology) Dr Arun Chopra said they had 35-40 unarmed guards, of which only 12-15 were present in the hospital at any given time. \u201cBut they are insufficient to handle a frenzied mob of even 50 persons,\u201d he said. He agreed with Dr Nagpal on hospital not having any other option. The Times of India on Sunday visited a few private hospitals. It found out that some doctors had hired security guards and deployed them in plain clothes and a few of them were even posing as patients, while there were doctors who brought licensed weapons to the hospital. Doctors were collectively of the view that poor infrastructure in government hospitals often forces patients to rush to private ones and many of them were not able to bear the high cost of treatment. In case of the patient\u2019s death of a patien, the kin didn\u2019t want to pay pending bills and started blaming doctors for negligence . \u201cOften these kind of people are sheltered by some local politicians, who instigate them to stage a dharna against the hospital and mount pressure on the management to waive their remaining bill,\u201d said a doctor, who didn\u2019t wish to give his name. Medicity managing director Dr Avtar Singh observed that private hospitals were more vulnerable to violence . \u201cWhen I started my hospital, I was advised to have security. At first, I did not feel the need for it. But, now, I need security,\u201d he said He adding that people, anyway, had gotten more aggressive these days. Avtar, who has hired private security, said guards not only regulate the traffic of patients, but also keep an eye on the behavioural pattern of relatives of a patient and warn the hospital staff accordingly. Justifying the need for bouncers, he said bills were the first and the foremost reason behind attacks on doctors. \u201cWhen it comes to paying the bill, they get hold of a local politician who instigate them for dharna. This happened with us about six months ago,\u201d he said, while suggesting that government should make stringent rules and declare violence against doctors a non-bailable offence. IMA Amritsar president Dr Inderbir Singh Nizzar said a complete shutdown would be observed on Monday. \u201cThere will be no OPD or elective surgeries, but emergency services will continue,\u201d he said. He said the IMA had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, proposing that a multifaceted approach which encompassed legislation, security, data collection, training and public awareness.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The crop is expected to be transplanted on nearly 28 lakh hectares, down from 31.4 lakh hectares last season. Though activists of three farm organisations had started transplanting paddy from June 1, the state agriculture and farmer welfare department had fixed June 13 as the date for starting paddy transplantation. The state government\u2019s efforts to dissuade farmers to do away with water-guzzling paddy varities has borne some fruit as there has been an increase in acreage under maize and cotton. Last season, basmati was grown on 5.46 lakh hectares and the area is expected to rise to 7 lakh hectares. In the previous season, cotton was sown over 2.83 lakh hectares and this has risen to 4 lakh hectares this year. Maize was sown in 1.1 lakh hectares last season, and is expected to be sown on 1.6 lakh hectares this time. Agriculture experts say paddy grown on an acre of land consumes nearly 60 lakh litres of water till harvesting, with a kg of paddy using up nearly 2,500 litres. As there are no rain so far and the weather is mostly dry, farmers are expected to draw underground water. In 2018, paddy transplantation started from June 20, but the date was advanced by a week this year after an announcement by Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh at a rally organised for the Lok Sabha elections. Agriculture scientists and water conservationists did not take kindly to the decision. The notification for paddy transplantation was issued by additional chief secretary Viswajeet Khanna on June 4. According to Punjab agriculture secretary Kahan Singh Pannu and director Sutantar Kumar, the department is geared up for paddy transplantation. There is some solace that area under water-guzzling paddy is expected to decrease to some extent and it is expected to increase under basmati rice, which uses less water.

The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said.

Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

However, more rains can be harmful for cotton and more so when water stagnates at the bottom of the plant, hitting the growth of the crop. The agriculture department officials are also elated over the rains which were long overdue for smooth transplantation of paddy and saving the cotton from long dry spell. \u201cWe were praying for rains to our cotton crop some much-needed relief from very hot and humid weather.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party.

WWF-India wetlands and water policy director (rivers) Suresh Babu told TOI on Monday that they needed to develop a management plan for the conservation of dolphins by involving local community and engaging them to be the custodians of these dolphins. In December 2007, the fresh water dolphin was sighted in the Harike Wetland and Wildlife Sanctuary for the first time. Authorities had then spotted two dolphins, which were believed to be either a mating pair or an adult mother with its young one. Dolphins are an indicator of a healthy river system. India is one of the few countries in the world that has two fresh water dolphin species - the Gangetic river dolphin and the Indus river dolphin, sub-species of South Asian river dolphin. Indus river dolphins are found in the Indus river system and the Beas river is their only habitat in the country.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "BJP List 2019 Maharashtra": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/two-sitting-mps-from-state-denied-tickets-in-bjps-list/articleshow/68514735.cms", "description": "AURANGABAD/KOLHAPUR: Sitting MPs Sunil Gaikwad (Latur) and Dilip Gandhi (Ahmednagar) were denied tickets for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in the BJP\u2019s first national list of candidates announced on Thursday.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

The message reached the Attari station master and was communicated to the railway ministry, which in turn informed the external affairs ministry (MEA) for necessary instructions,\u201d divisional railway manager, Firozpur division, Rajesh Aggarwal told TOI. \u201cHowever, the MEA denied permission for the train to pick up the pilgrims, stating that it was not a properly routed proposal,\u201d Aggarwal added. So, the pilgrims who have permission to enter Pakistan only on train have no recourse now unless the two countries give them permission to visit Pakistan by road. The trip, as of now, is unlikely to ahead. Even Samjhauta Express only runs between India and Pakistan twice a week. The Sikh pilgrims had arrived at Attari international border on Friday morning to board the special train that was to arrive at Attari international railway station from Pakistan. However, the Pakistani train remained stationed at Wagah (Pakistan) railway station as it did not get permission to enter India. The denial of permission to the train caused resentment among the pilgrims who staged a demonstration at Attari international railway station and criticized the central government for allegedly creating obstacles in performing their religious rituals. The long wait for permission and no information on the Indian side led to fraying tempers and anger amongst the pilgrims. Talking to TOI, an elderly Sikh devotee, Darshan Singh said nobody knew why India was not giving permission to the train to enter Attari. \u201cWe have been told that train has come up to Wagah railway station and is waiting for permission from the Indian side,\u201d he said and added that everyone was highly disappointed as now they would not be able to undertake pilgrimage to Pakistan. \u201cDeliberate attempts are being made to create obstacles in fulfilling our religious aspirations that too by our own leaders,\u201d the angry man added. Angry that \u2018Guru ki Sangat\u2019 was being harassed, another devotee, Gurdev Singh said the central government should have not allowed them to apply for visas according to the martyrdom anniversary programme chalked by Pakistan on the basis of Nanakshahi calendar adopted in 2003. \u201cThey should have stopped us earlier. Now visas have been issued and we are ready to board the train but Indian Railways is not allowing it to enter India,\u201d he said. Leader of Nankana Sahib Sikh Yatree Jatha, Swaran Singh Gill, said he along with other Sikh devotees was highly disappointed on returning from Attari. Former PSGPC president Bishan Singh told TOI over phone from Wagah that a lot of senior PSGPC office-bearers as well as the Evacuee Trust Property Board officials were waiting for the Sikh jatha at Wagah. He said that India should have given entry to the Pakistani train so that the devotees could observe the martyrdom anniversary pending solution on the contentious Nanakshahi Calendar issue.
