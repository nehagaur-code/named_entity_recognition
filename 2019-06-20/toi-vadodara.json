A surprise pick by the ruling BJP-led NDA   , Birla's name was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself for the post, sources said. The 56-year-old leader is considered to be close to both Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah. Birla's nomination for the Lok Sabha Speaker's post also has the   backing of non-NDA parties   such as the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). Starting his political journey as a student leader, Birla was also elected to the Rajasthan Assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. He won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was again elected this year from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. Birla defeated Congress's Ramnarayan Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently-concluded general election. A conscientious parliamentarian, Birla has registered an 86-per cent average attendance in the House, asked 671 questions, participated in 163 debates and introduced six private members' bills in the 16th Lok Sabha. From 1991 to 2003, he was a key leader in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) as a state-level president first and then, as a vice-president at the national level. Birla, who holds a Masters degree in commerce, is a member of the Standing Committee on Energy in Parliament, the Committee on Petitions and the Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. He succeeds eight-time MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Lok Sabha Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this is not the first time that a relative newcomer has occupied the position. In 1996, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader G M C Balayogi, also a two-time MP then, was elected as the Speaker in the Lower House of Parliament. After his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

Uncertainty loomed large over their kin as most of the deceased were sole breadwinners for their families. The incident took place at Hotel Darshan on Dabhoi-Vadodara state highway between 12 midnight and 12.30 am. One of the workers had entered the tank for cleaning it but fell unconscious. T he remaining workers went inside one after the other to save the others, but all of them ended up suffocating to death.  Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services uses an earthmover to widen the mouth of the tank to recover the bodiesThe hotel owner, Hassan Abbas Bhoraniya, was booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and violation of Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act and Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. He is absconding, said police. Meanwhile, the Gujarat government announced a financial assistance of Rs 4 lakh each to the kin of all the deceased. In a statement, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said that he has directed the police to take strict action against the hotel owner. Workers died of suffocation due to high gas pressureThe seven deceased include Ashok Harijan (45), his son Hitesh Harijan (23), Mahesh Harijan (25), Mahesh Patanwadiya (47), Vijay Chaudhary (22), Sahdev Vasava (22) and Ajay Vasava (22). While Ashok, his son Hitesh, Patanwadiya and Mahesh Harijan were called for cleaning the septic tank, Chaudhary, Sahdev and Ajay were housekeeping employees at the hotel and were assisting them. Ashok was the first to enter the tank and had removed some of the dirty water using a bucket. But when the rope tied to bucket broke, he went further inside the tank to bring out the bucket. After going a little deep, Ashok got affected by the poisonous gas and shouted for help. On hearing that, Ashok\u2019s son Hitesh entered the tank but fell unconscious. When the fatherson duo did not come out Mahesh went inside followed by the three housekeeping staff of the hotel. Patanwadiya, a farmer, who had come only to carry the dirt in his tractor also entered the tank to rescue the six others, but he too fell victim to the poisonous gas. As all seven of them went missing, a couple of boys who had accompanied the workers called the hotel staff who in turn informed the Dabhoi municipality and local police. Since the municipality did not have necessary equipment, they sought help from Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services. \u201cAll seven died of suffocation as the pressure of gas was high in the tank,\u201d said Vadodara fire officer Nikunj Azad. The mouth of the tank was so narrow that firemen had to widen it using an earthmover to bring out the bodies. Once the bodies were removed, a suction tank vehicle of Vadodara Municipal Corporation cleaned the tank. \u201cWe had sent teams to the hotel owner\u2019s home in Bharuch and native Siddhpur, but he was not found at any of the locations,\u201d said deputy superintendent of police K V Solanki. The practice of manual scavenging that is banned by law, however, continues in Gujarat and has reportedly claimed 180 lives since 1993, claimed social activist Parshottam Vaghela. Earlier this year, five sanitation works have died of suffocation after entering manholes or septic tanks in separate incidents in Ahmedabad. In 1993 Union government had enacted the law prohibiting manual scavenging and in 2013 amended it to The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act- 2013. Between 1993 and 2013 at least 141 manhole workers have died after entering gutter or sewers, as per figures obtained under the RTI Act. Between 2014 and 2019 37 deaths of manhole workers have been reported, added Vaghela. Enraged over the incident Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra twitted, \u201cEnough.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

Eight of them are legendary tigers,\u201d Patel, 35, said. \u201cWhenever a visitor came to Tadoba, he or she used to ask a lot of questions about the sanctuary, the tigers and other living beings here. Also, there used to be a lot of confusion about the identity of tigers. Over last few years, I had developed my own technique of identifying tigers. I can identify a tiger just by looking at its face and walk,\u201d Patel added. It was then that Patel\u2019s friends and colleagues suggested that he should share his knowledge with others and write a book. \u201cI began working on the book two years ago and it was recently released in Tadoba. Harsh Mahajan, a Barodian who took photos of tigers in Tadoba, also contributed to my book,\u201d Patel said. Interestingly, Patel is a fine arts graduate from M S University and hasn\u2019t taken any formal training in wildlife. \u201cI learnt everything about the tigers by reading books. It was my sheer passion that drove me to become a naturalist,\u201d he added.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

Dabhoi municipality lets it suction tank vehicle for private use for a nominal cost whenever a formal request is put up. But Bhoraniya, instead of approaching the sanitation department of the municipality, decided to call in Ashok Harijan, his son Hitesh, Mahesh Harijan and Mahesh Patanwadiya. Ashok, Hitesh, Mahesh, Patanwadiya and three others were suffocated to death when they entered the tank for cleaning. \u201cWe let our vehicle to private persons for cleaning septic tanks depending on the availability.

There is a charge of Rs 250 for every time the vehicle\u2019s tank is filled and emptied,\u201d said a municipality officer. As the restaurant\u2019s septic tank is 12 to 15 foot deep, the suction tank vehicle would have to be filled and emptied at least 10 to 12 times. This means, the owner would have had to spend around Rs 3,300 to Rs 3,500 for the work. The hotel owner saved only Rs 1,300 to Rs 1,500 as the four workers were promised Rs 500 each for cleaning the tank. While the official said that they let out the suction vehicle for private use, but it takes several days and many requests before the vehicle is sent. \u201cWe have only two such vehicles and our own drainage lines are often choked, so we send the vehicle only if it\u2019s available. However, in this case, we did not receive any application or request from the hotel owner,\u201d the sanitation department official said. On Saturday, the hotel staff had told TOI that it was for the first time that workers were called in to clean the tank manually. \u201cThere is a pump to clean the septic tank but because a pipe had choked, it was decided to get it cleaned manually,\u201d said one hotel employee who is working there for the past eight months.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

Mahesh Harijan worked as a casual daily-wage labourer, while Mahesh Patanwadiya was a small farmer.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh.

The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

The step may bring respite to those in Vadodara city and villages along the Charotar belt who usually see these reptiles lurking in water bodies in their vicinity. Today, there are close to 250 crocodiles in Charotar belt and 300 in Vadodara city. The work on creating the unique habitat has already begun and it will be ready in two months. \u201cThe area will house more than 100 crocodiles,\u201d said Shrivastav. \u201cThe forest department usually releases the rescued crocodiles. Now, they will be released in this zone. There are 37 such abandoned mines that can be exploited for similar purposes,\u201d said deputy conservator of forests Anshuman Sharma. What has prompted the move is the gradual increase in incidents of human-reptile conflicts. In Vadodara, citizens may have made peace with these jawed reptiles, but Vishwamitri river has witnessed crocodile attacks at Sama lake and Asoj lake where five lives were lost in 2014. In 2017, two injuries were reported in Vishwamitri river, while in the following year, three injuries were recorded there. \u201cPeople in the Charotar belt have learnt to live with crocodiles, which is not the case in Vadodara city,\u201d said former Wildlife Institute of India (WII) member B C Choudhry. The growing attacks are also being reasoned to the growing number of crocodile population. These reptiles are highly territorial, making them more prone to attacks. The 2015 census had revealed presence of over 260 crocodiles in the 25km stretch of Vishwamitri river that passes through the heart of Vadodara. In the Anand-Charotar belt, 58 crocodiles were sighted at Deva village in Anand district. After Deva, the maximum number of crocodiles (38) were sighted in the two water bodies of Heranj, followed by 28 and 25 in Traj and Dabhou villages.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing. Living with the dead: A grave in the backyard\"All we are asking for is some land for our ancestors. There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar. Their burial grounds are filled to capacity,\" said Nizam Khan, a mechanic. Village pradhan Sundar Kumar said that he had asked officials several times for a burial ground for Muslim families, but no action was taken.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Pawar alleged that the VMC officials don\u2019t pay heed to his representations, but swing into action only when the opposition party councillors threaten to protest. He further alleged that the contractors hired by the VMC don\u2019t do their work efficiently. Pawar said that the opposition is making a big issue out of the turbid water supply and warned that it can spiral into an election issue in the civic polls next year. The supply of water from Nimeta to a population of around five lakh in the eastern and southern parts of the city had become a major loss of face for the civic body body. Gross irregularities had come to light regarding the operation and maintenance of the plant some time ago and it was also alleged that there were defects in it. The civic body had sacked one engineer and suspended another over the turbid water supply issue last month. VMC also blacklisted two firms that were responsible for building a filtration plant at Nimeta and maintenance of the facility. The civic body had swung into action and began cleaning up the water treatment plant after the controversy surfaced.

Their mother died of jaundice at the age of 38. Kuheli was 13 years old then. \u201cMy only aim was to make my daughters self-sufficient. I did not know how to cook, I learnt that and now I can claim to be a good cook,\u201d said Banerjee, 60. \u201cFrom the beginning, I wanted my daughters to be independent so that whether they get married or not, they don\u2019t have to be dependent on anyone,\u201d he said.

Gujarat has earned the distinction of disposing of maximum number of cases pending for the past 10 years. According to the data of National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), the lower courts in the state together disposed of 3,68,762 cases between 2015 to 2018. In the same period, All subordinate courts across the country had disposed over 12 lakh such cases during the same period. Uttar Pradesh was the second fastest in speedy disposal by clearing 2,68,465 cases. In fact, the disposal rate of cases in the state has been consistently high for the last four years. High court officials said that the high rate of disposal of old cases is mainly due to different initiatives taken. Regular meetings and monitoring of judicial officers at district level helped in bringing down the pendency rate of more than a decade-old cases. At district levels too meetings are held with lawyers to impart training and sensitization so that the old cases are not dragged for long. \u201cThe national lok adalats also help a lot in disposing the old cases,\u201d an official said. In fact, in April this year the Union law and justice ministry had lauded the state for high disposal rate of cases which are older than 10 years. A joint secretary of the ministry had written a letter of appreciation to the registrar of Gujarat high court as four district courts had ranked among the top 10 subordinate courts in the country that had disposed such cases in March. The high court registry had sent several suggestions to the ministry so that other states can too increase the disposal rate of such cases. As of now, the cases which are pending for over 10 years stand at 2,19,553, which is lower than Uttar Pradesh \u2013 9,63,538 \u2013 Bihar (3,98,118), West Bengal (2,94,858) among other states. According to the NJGD figures, the pendency of old cases in Gujarat is mostly waiting for presence of important witnesses or due to stay by a district court or high court. Another reason is also because of heavy pendency in court due to which time cannot be given to certain cases. Last year, courts in Ahmedabad district had disposed of maximum number of cases \u2013 28,679 \u2013 in the state, followed by 21,786 cases of Vadodara district, 8,319 cases of Surat district, 6,242 cases of Rajkot and 5,873 cases of Jamnagar.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "BJP List 2019 Maharashtra": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/two-sitting-mps-from-state-denied-tickets-in-bjps-list/articleshow/68514735.cms", "description": "AURANGABAD/KOLHAPUR: Sitting MPs Sunil Gaikwad (Latur) and Dilip Gandhi (Ahmednagar) were denied tickets for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in the BJP\u2019s first national list of candidates announced on Thursday. The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination. His late grandfather, Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, was long associated with the Congress. | Full coverage of Lok Sabha elections in MaharashtraAmong other prominent leaders from Maharashtra in the first list of candidates are Union minister Nitin Gadkari from his hometown Nagpur, state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve from Jalna, Union MoS Hansraj Ahir from Chandrapur and Union MoS for defence Subash Bhamre from Dhule. Late BJP MP Gopinath Munde\u2019s daughter, Pritam, who was elected to Parliament with a record majority after her father\u2019s death, has been renominated from Beed. Sitting MP from Sangli Sanjay Patil has also been renominated, putting an end to speculation over any change in constituency. Patil\u2019s candidature was opposed by a section of BJP leaders in Sangli. However, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is understood to have called a meeting of local party leaders and resolved the differences. The party has also given tickets to Heena Gavit from Nandurbar, Raksha Khadse from Raver, Poonam Mahajan from Mumbai North Central, Kapil Patil from Bhiwandi, Sanjay Dhotre from Akola, Ramdas Tadas from Wardha, Ashok Nete from Gadchiroli and Gopal Shetty from Mumbai North.
