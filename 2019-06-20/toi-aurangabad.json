The region, comprising eight districts, has received an average of only 16mm rainfall \u2014 accounting for only a little over 2% of average its annual rainfall received from June to October. The overall monsoon deficiency in Marathwada is more than double as compared to country\u2019s rainfall deficiency that stands at an average 43%. As per official data, Nanded district has received the lowest 6% of the expected showers since June 1, followed by Aurangabad (8%), Jalna (12%), Hingoli (16%) and Beed (21%). Remaining three districts from the region have reported over 30% of the expected rainfall during the current rainy season, offering some respite to the drought-hit areas. Latur district has recorded the highest 39% of the expected rainfall so far followed by Parbhani (36%) and Osmanabad (30%). In its monsoon-related bulletin, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said that conditions were becoming favourable for further advancement of the southwest monsoon to more parts of central Arabian Sea, Karnataka and remaining parts of Tamil Nadu. \u201cIn a regular course of action, the southwest monsoon should have reached central India by now, but it is yet to reach Maharashtra. The monsoon has been lingering over the southern peninsula and other areas with only coastal parts of Karnataka and Kerala received monsoon-related rain so far,\u201d the IMD said. As per Met forecast, monsoon is likely to become active again once cyclone Vayu crosses the Gujarat coast by Monday evening. Shriniwas Aundhkar, director of city-based APJ Abdul Kalam Centre for Astronomy and Research, said south-east Maharashtra that includes parts of Marathwada such as Latur and Nanded district can expect arrival of Monsoon by June 20-21. \u201cBesides the fact that progress of monsoon was somewhat halted due to cyclone Vayu, it was observed that no strong weather conditions were formed for the formation and onset of the southwest monsoon this year since the beginning. Let us hope that no more major hurdles come in the path of the onset of monsoon,\u201d he said. The farming community is among many who have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of monsoon. Ashok Mane, a farmer from Tadsonna village in Beed district, said it was nerve-wrecking to wait for the monsoon even after the first half of June is over. \u201cWe received pre-Monsoon showers, but those were inadequate to undertake the sowing activity during Kharif season. The drought has broken the backbone of the farming community and the extended delay is very agonizing,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, sporadic showers were reported in parts of the city with nearly 10mm rainfall getting recorded till 6.30pm on Monday.

In a letter dated June 4 sent to the agriculture director and joint commissioner of GST Bhavan, secretary MNS Paithan Taluka Vilas Jagdale and Aurangabad district chief Vijay Chavan had complained to both departments about the sale of bogus seeds and fertilizers directly responsible for farmer suicides. Referring to the action taken by agriculture department in Gangapur Taluka against marketing of bogus fertilizer worth Rs 3.5 lakh, the party unit stated that such practices cause financial losses to the farmers which leads them to the extreme step of ending their life. While the seeds are tax free, a GST of 5% is charged on fertilisers. Jagdale, a homeopathic doctor and a farmer himself, said that the crop loss cannot solely be credited to water scarcity. \u201cFor example, cotton is a crop for regions with dry weather. The crop yields better in drier areas than in water sufficient areas. However, it is due to the poor quality of seeds and fertilizer which causes huge losses to cotton farmers,\u201d he said. The MNS activists met with the state GST officials and informed them about the problem. Speaking to TOI, Santosh Shriwastav, deputy commissioner, state GST, confirmed that the department will hold confidential enquiry to find out about the sale of products without the payment of GST. \u201cI have forwarded the matter to joint commissioner, state tax Aurangabad division. Subsequently, our inspectors will verify the books of accounts of the seed and fertilizer dealers and impose penalty if tax evasion is found,\u201d Shriwastav said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam, in which the rituals are performed over five days in and around Mecca. Compared to this, Umrah, which is termed as mini pilgrimage, is optional and can be performed any time throughout the year. Usually, Umrah tours range from five to 40 days. During the Haj season, the pilgrims who want to perform only Umrah are not allowed. Haj Committee of India was formed in the 2002 through a central parliamentary Act.

The MIM corporators raised slogans against the mayor and created ruckus during the meeting. They also tried to snatch away the mace of the mayor. Following this, six MIM corporators were suspended for a day by the mayor. Subsequently, Sena-BJP, Congress and NCP joined hands to condemn the behavior of MIM members and insisted the mayor to pass a resolution to disqualify all the 20 MIM corporators present at the meeting. Following this, the mayor directed the municipal administration to prepare a proposal that will be sent to the state government, seeking its nod to disqualify the unruly corporators. The mayor also asked the civic administration to suspend and inquire the conduct of civic body\u2019s security officer Baburao Jadhav for not handling the situation properly even after being ordered to do so. Ghodele has asked the administration to ensure that 10 ex-servicemen hired by the civic body be posted at every general body meeting to tackle any such eventuality in the future. He also asked the administration to appoint women security guards. It all began with BJP members suggesting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be greeted for coming back to power for the second consecutive term. To this, Ghodele announced that he approves the proposal to greet Modi as well as all the newly-elected Members of Parliament. After a while, the MIM members entered the meeting hall and opposition leader Sarita Borde led by 19 other corporators raised the issue of passing a proposal to greet Jaleel. However, mayor ignored this demand saying that he has already approved a proposal greeting all the newly-elected MPs and no specific proposal could be passed. However, the MIM corporators insisted the mayor to consider their resolution. When mayor continued to ignore their demand, the corporators raised slogans against him and tried to snatch away the mace. He then suspended six of the MIM members for a day while asking them to go away. However, other MIM corporators rushed to the rescue of their colleagues and staged a sit-in in front of the podium. In the meantime, Congress corporator Afsar Khan strongly opposed the resolution alleging that MIM MP didn\u2019t deserve such a greeting. The mayor then called the police in.

However, with the help of police women they too were removed from the hall. Water issue raisedAfter the MIM corporators were removed from the meeting hall, the BJP took the administration to task for its failure in tackling the drinking water issue. BJP corporator Nitin Chittee virtually prostrated before the civic officials to draw the administration and mayor\u2019s attentions towards the acute water shortage faced by the residents. Madhuri Advant, another BJP corporator, threatened the administration of launching a \u2018jail bharo\u2019 agitation. She said that when she staged demonstration outside the water reservoir, the administration lodged police complaints against the agitators. Advant, who is also a lawyer, said several wards were getting water supply after a gap of nine to 10 days, still the administration or the officials concerned failed to act properly. The mayor then asked the municipal commissioner Nipun Vinayak to explain the situation who said the situation would be under control in a matter of four days.

Thus, the advanced devices help the central server to immediately detect any significant deviation in power consumption and thus detect any attempt of power theft,\u201d he said.Power thefts amounting to Rs2.37 lakh were reported in Latur during April and May and necessary criminal proceedings have been initiated against offenders.Among other benefits of the newly-installed meters, these devices help the state power utility in generating accurate monthly bills. \u201cThe meters and its server operate with minimal human interface which makes the entire system impeccable and accountable. The new devices are best considering the interest of consumers as well as that of the MSEDCL,\u201d Patil said.Nanded, Latur and Jalgaon are among MSEDCL zones that are notorious for power thefts and the state power utility has set a target of installing over 8.5 lakh new electric meters having the RF and IR technology here.Among different cities, Latur has a target of installation of such 88,338 meters of which 62,265 have been put into place by replacing the old devices.Aurangabad division of MSEDCL, comprising Aurangabad, Latur, Nanded and Jalgaon zones, had caught as many as 19,844 cases of power thefts during the last fiscal, recovering fine worth Rs6.02 crore.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The corporators asked the mayor to display the photos and videos, for which he allegedly had spent Rs 20 lakh of people\u2019s money. Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele refuted the allegations, calling them baseless. The public relations officer of the AMC said most of the money was spent on making video recordings of anti-encroachment drives and of solid waste management. On Saturday, based on the reply by the AMC\u2019s accounts department to an RTI plea, Aurangabad MP Imtiyaz Jaleel said at a press conference that, from October 29, 2017 to December 31, 2018, Ghodele spent Rs 19.93 lakh on photos and videos. \u201cThe mayor has spent Rs 19.98 lakh on photographs and videos of his events, Rs 4.70 lakh on tea, Rs 1.11 lakh on garlands and shawls, Rs 10.42 lakh on renovation of an already renovated official bungalow and Rs 4.19 lakh on food and sound system during the general body meetings,\u201d Jaleel had alleged. Jaleel said that at a time when the civic body did not have money to pay salary to its employees and contractors, the mayor spending money on unwanted things is uncalled for. \u201cWhen the mayor can purchase a sound system for less than Rs 1 lakh, why is he spending so much money on renting it?\u201d he asked. He pledged to dig out all documents from the civic body and bring all the scams to surface to ensure that the corrupt officials and corporators are put behind bars. On Monday, MIM corporators led by leader of opposition in AMC Sarita Borde, group leader Naser Siddique and district chief Shaikh camped outside the AMC office and raised slogans against the mayor. \u201cWe have asked the municipal commissioner to write to the chief minister about the gross misuse of public money by the mayor. If municipal commissioner doesn\u2019t act we will go to the court against the mayor for violation of article 10 (1) of Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporations Act 1949,\u201d Siddique said. Ghodele, however, said the allegations were baseless and were part of the MIM\u2019s habit. \u201cThe claims made about expenditure of Rs 20 lakh on photos and videos show their lack of knowledge. Only Rs 1.21 lakh is spent on my photos which were taken when I was on official visits,\u201d he said, adding that explanation of Rs 20 lakh expenditure will be given by the AMC\u2019s public relations officer. On Sunday, Ghodele had said that he as a mayor has certain privileges and the post should not be dragged into politics. \u201cI do not take the MP\u2019s allegations seriously. Their party has a tendency to make allegations.\u201d He said Jaleel should focus on development of the city rather than petty issues. \u201cBy bringing out such controversies, they are diverting us from development issues. I have commitment to the public and I will answer them about the money spent by me while holding the office.\u201d The AMC\u2019s PRO said, out of the Rs 19.93 lakh, Rs 4.95 lakh was spent on filming the actions taken by the anti-encroachment department as a proof in case of any legal complication, Rs 3.68 lakh was spent on coverage of welcome ceremonies, press conferences, anniversary celebrations and impromptu events, Rs 1.21 lakh was spent on photos and videos of mayor\u2019s visits. Rs 10.85 lakh worth of photos and videos were shot about the garbage issue of the city. \u201cAt one time, local residents resisted dumping of waste in their area at 4am.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

Low water levels in dams across the region, including Jayakwadi, and power shutdowns for maintenance have aggravated the problem. On Friday, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited (MSEDCL) conducted a shut down for maintenance works. As a result, taps ran dry in many areas for sixth consecutive day on Saturday. Residents began calling up tankers but were told about higher than usual rates. Suwarta Dongardive, a resident of Cidco N-6, said her laundry is piling up. \u201cWe cannot afford tankers but there is no option. We earlier used to pay Rs 300-400 for 2,000 litre tanker. Now, we are being asked to pay Rs 600 to private supplier,\u201d she said. Every alternate house in Gulmohar Colony Cidco N-5 has to shell out money to purchase private tankers. In Nandanwan Colony, if one needs a tanker, they have to book a day in advance. Santosh Bhujbal, a tanker supplier, said his family well has dried up and he has to pay the owner of another well for pumping water. \u201cWe have to pay the owner Rs 200-250 and then add the transportation cost. This is the reason the prices have surged,\u201d Bhujbal said. Cidco based SK suppliers said most local well have dried up, forcing them to fetch water from a well near the railway station. In April, the AMC had sought a report from its deputy engineers on the number of public and private wells in their zones with an intent to acquire them following district collector\u2019s permission. When asked about the acquisition of wells, municipal commissioner Nipun Vinayak said a list of acquired wells is shared with the deputy engineers for testing of water and starting the distribution. \u201cIt appears that water from many wells is unfit for drinking due to E coli,\u201d he said. Vinayak added that no regulation for the quality or price of private water suppliers is in place but he would prepare bylaws for the regulation and submit it in the forthcoming general body meeting.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing.

There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar.

While no specific budgetary allocations have been made for these two projects, the desired fund flow is expected in due course of time as both the ventures have official mention in the state budget. Among different specific allocations related to the region, finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar has earmarked funds worth Rs50crore for the development of pilgrim and tourist site of Kapildhara in Beed district along with five other similar sites across the state. A section of public representatives was demanding a state-of-the-art sports complex at Waluj following which a search for around 65-acre land had begun. First announced by the higher and technical education minister Rajesh Tope in 2013, the city has been waiting eagerly for the sports university. A demand was also raised before the state legislature, responding to which state minister Vinod Tawde had said that the desired facility will be raised at Karodi on the outskirts of Aurangabad. Notably, the newly-appointed state sports commissioner Om Prakash Bakoria has brought some momentum towards establishment of the long-pending National Sports University sanctioned in Aurangabad. The additional budget also has a mention of proposed multi-crore water grid project for Marathwada, but no specific budgetary allocation has been made. State water supply minister Babanrao Lonikar recently said the detailed project report (DPR) for the water grid was ready and actual work on the project during the first phase would begin before the upcoming Assembly elections in the state. Located around 15-km from Beed, Kapildhara has a few waterfalls and is a popular tourist destination during monsoon.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

She was diagnosed with left pynoephrosis (pus filled kidney) non-functioning left kidney. Subsequently, the doctors decided to perform a surgery and remove her left kidney. Urologist Aditya Yelikar said that if the kidney would not have been removed, the patient could have slipped into sepsis, endangering her life. \"The nuclear scan reported the functioning of the kidney as zero percent,\" he said. The kidney could have either been removed through open surgery or minimally invasive method (laparoscopy). An open surgery tends to leave scars, causes pain, and takes longer time to heal. Therefore, the doctors decided to go ahead with the laparoscopy surgery which requires a minor incision. The surgery was conducted after taking the patient's and her kin's consent. After explaining everything about the surgery to the patient and her kin, the doctors decided to remove the infected kidney through the vagina so as to ensure that there are no scars and cuts. Yelikar undertook the procedure called nephrectomy with trans-vaginal retrieval of specimen. This procedure ensures early recovery and the patient is discharged within 48 hours. \"As the kidney is as big as 10 cm the usual laparoscopy could have caused a much bigger incision. Therefore, the organ was removed through vagina.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The power outage not only left the residents sweating, but also led to disruption in water supply in many areas. MIDC Chikalthana industries also remained shut due to power disruption. According to a release by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), due to power outage at Jayakwadi, from 8.30am to 9.40am on Saturday, water could not be lifted at 56MLD and 100MLD pumping stations during that time. Pumping could start at 10.30am from Jayakwadi. This had a domino effect on water pumping station at Pharola, where pumping normalised at 12.30pm. Water works department executive engineer Hemant Kolhe said that it takes around 6 to 8 hours for water to reach the ESRs in the city from Pharola. In addition, as part of its routine pre-monsoon maintenance, the MSEDCL undertook power shutdowns at its feeders supplying power to elevated storage reservoirs (ESRs) at Kranti Chowk, Cidco N-5 and Cidco N-7 from 10.15am to 3.15pm. Subsequently, water supply from these ESRs was affected. Water distribution resumed at 5pm. Tanker supply remained affected throughout Friday in the affected ESRs. Residents from lane number 12 of Jai Bhawani Nagar, who came to Cidco N-5 ESR, said that they had paid for tanker water three months in advance. \u201cThe AMC charges Rs1,100 for 200-litre water on alternate days for three months. Today is the fifth day that we have not received any water. Nine of us paid Rs30 each to come to ESR tanker but they flatly refused supply,\u201d Sunita Shinde, a resident, said. Officials at the AMC water works department said that power shutdown at Jayakwadi on Saturday will affect water supply for two days. The supply will normalise only after two days, they said. Meanwhile, production at industries in Chikalthana MIDC had to bear the impact of MSEDCL\u2019s scheduled shutdown. MSEDCL urban superintending engineer B Nirmal said that the maintenance will help reduce frequent power outages faced by the units in the industrial estate.

The fact is that the industrial houses usually go slow during he summers due to water scarcity and start returning to normalcy with the onset of monsoon, which eventually increases the demand for labourers, skilled as well as unskilled. Taking advantage of the high absorption rate of daily wage labourers in Aurangabad\u2019s industrial areas of MIDC Waluj, Shendra and to some extent in the Chikalthana area, several labourers from different parts of the country come here and get employment. Police authorities maintained that it is part of the preventive measures being taken by the city police for keeping a check on criminals. Aurangabad commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad said, \u201cWe do not appreciate people getting hired or being given houses and flats on rent sans police verification. It is serious if those with criminal backgrounds are hiding in the city and working as labourers.\u201d The officer maintained that the police are concerned with labourers with criminal records as the presence of such elements help fuel illegal activities and criminal conduct. The police maintained that not only labourers, but also several labour and security contractors, are getting absorbed sans police verifications and are working without any license or authenticity in different industrial areas of the city. In the past. there have been incidents where the police has found that criminals elements, in an attempt to evade arrest, are working as labourers in the industrial areas of Aurangabad by using a fake identity. Sources in the police department said that even during the industrial violence of August 9, 2017, mobs that were later termed as \u2018motivated crowd\u2019, comprising locals and outsiders alike, targeted major industrial houses, causing losses amounting to several crores. Police authorities are also considering labourers with criminal records as the link between the manufacturers of country-made firearms and local purchasers.

It's also the first time in years a Shiv Sena leader out of Beed has secured a cabinet berth. The last time the party had this much influence in the region was when Suresh Navale held a minister of state rank back in 1995. Since then, the Sena has been unable to make any considerable progress in the district - eventually reduced to contesting just one seat (Beed city) out of six assembly constituencies. The Sena would contest from the Georai and Ashti seats too, but withdrew when the late BJP stalwart, Gopinath Munde, won negotiations with the party's leadership, Sena observers in Beed told TOI. Khsirsagar, who had much to the chagrin of NCP leaders supported the BJP's Beed nominee Pritam Munde prior to the Lok Sabha polls, enjoys good ties with the Gopinath Munde camp. He is also rumoured to have joined the Sena at the behest of BJP leadership as the Beed city constituency goes to the Sena\u2019s account for the next assembly election if the Sena-BJP poll arrangement is worked out, party sources said. Insiders also ruled out the possibility of a clash between Kshirsagar and the BJP's Pankaja Munde, the rural development minister and Beed\u2019s guardian minister. According to sources, the Sena would want Kshirsagar to expand the party's base in the district and beyond. Sources close to Khshirsgar said he is expected to lose votes from his Muslim and Dalit base. But he stands to get votes from the Sena-BJP catchment, they said, while citing his victory in the 2014 assembly polls in which he defeated Vinayak Mete, the Maratha leader who had contested on a BJP ticket, by a margin of 5,000 votes. News of Kshirsagar's appointment, however, has not gone down well with veteran Sena party workers. \"We now have to work for the man we had fought against,\u2019\u2019 said a senior Sena leader in Beed. He added that the move has \"demoralized\" senior workers of the party. The Aurangabad district found representation in the form of BJP\u2019s Atul Save, the Aurangabad East MLA, although state assembly speaker, Haribhau Bagade, also belongs to the district. Save\u2019s appointment makes a difference as he is essentially a party worker, state BJP president, Shirish Boralkar, told TOI. \"His elevation will strengthen the BJP's presence in the district. It would help the party in the next assembly and the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation elections,\u2019\u2019 Boralkar said. Local sources said Save's appointment would boost the morale of BJP workers in Aurangabad, where the party has been relying on the Shiv Sena, whose four-time MP Chandrakant Khaire lost to the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen's Imtiyaz Jaleel in the Lok Sabha polls. \"Khaire's loss underscores the fact that the Sena has been losing ground here,\" a source said. \"Khaire, instead of introspection, has been blaming the BJP for his defeat. He suspects the BJP supported Harshvardhan Jadhav, an ex-Sena man and son-in-law of the party\u2019s state unit president Raosaheb Danve (also the Union minister of food and civil supplies), to ensure his defeat. But that is not true. Khaire lost because of his bad performance,\u2019\u2019 another BJP leader said.

Vikas Yedke, an MIM corporator, had approached the high court seeking directions to the government to institute an inquiry into the role of the officers and appropriate action against them. On Monday, deputy secretary of the urban development department, filed an affidavit informing the court that the officer inquiring into the conduct of the civic engineers had been transferred and that due to engagements involving the state budget session, the process was being delayed. The deputy secretary also informed the court that inquiry would be conducted on July 4. The matter came up for hearing before the bench comprising Justice Prasanna B Warale and Justice R G Agachat, when B L Sagar Killarikar, the lawyer representing the petitioner, pointed out to the court that the inquiry officer was changed without any reason. The bench directed the government not to change the newly-appointed inquiry officer till the completion of the inquiry. The court directed that the new inquiry officer should conduct inquiry within six months and the report be submitted to the court. The government had in 2016 sanctioned Rs 24.33 crore special fund for improvement of the roads to Aurangabad Municipal corporation (AMC). The works were to be conducted under observation and supervision of a three-member committee comprising divisional commissioner, the district collector and the municipal commissioner. Despite this, the civic engineers allegedly connived to ensure that only one company got the work and made changes in the process violating the norms, the petition alleged. The petitioner had made representations to various authorities. He approached the high court through lawyers Killarikar and N T Tribhuwan when he failed to get response from other authorities. Following the high court directions, two inquiries were ordered into the work \u2014 one by divisional commissioner and the other by principal secretary of urban development department. Both the inquiries indicted three civic officials for causing a loss of about Rs 1.67 crore to the civic body. The then municipal commissioner, Omprakash Bakoria, had initiated a departmental inquiry, but the general body didn\u2019t give permission and subsequently petitioner approached the high court. Again, following high court directions D M Muglikar, the then civic body chief, appointed a regional inquiry officer to conduct the department inquiry. But this officer was having equivalent grade of the officials facing probe. Yedke then had then filed a civil application through Killarikar and Tribhwan pointing out that primary inquiry was conducted by an IAS officer of the principal secretary rank, therefore inquiry officer should be of the rank of secretary. Considering the arguments, bench then comprising Justices S S Shinde and R G Avachat had observed \u201cin our opinion it may not be proper to entrust the inquiry of erring officers with the regional inquiry officer, Aurangabad who is not higher in rank. In our opinion, no prejudice would be caused to the delinquents if the inquiry is conducted by the inquiry officer not below the rank of the joint secretary.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "time": "2019-06-19 13:06:00", "datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-directs-govt-not-to-transfer-officer/articleshow/69848778.cms"}, "Anushka joins hubby Virat in England ahead of India-Afghanistan match": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//videos/entertainment/hindi/anushka-sharma-joins-hubby-virat-kohli-in-england-ahead-of-india-afghanistan-match/videoshow/69860085.cms", "description": ""}, "Lesser known facts about Gurmeet Choudhary": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/lesser-known-facts-about-gurmeet-choudhary/photostory/65672397.cms", "description": ""}, "Women artists shine at an exhibition held in Aurangabad": {"time": "2019-06-15 11:11:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/women-artists-shine-at-an-exhibition-held-in-aurangabad/articleshow/69790561.cms", "description": "It was a delight for art lovers of Aurangabad as they came under one roof when eight female artists displayed their work at the recently held exhibition in the city.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Section of teachers stage protest": {"time": "2019-06-18 12:30:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/section-of-teachers-stage-protest/articleshow/69831206.cms", "description": "AURANGABAD: Coinciding with the reopening of schools after the summer vacation, a section of teachers from some unaided schools protested to highlight their demands, including for benefits of the old pension scheme, on Monday.

Speaking to TOI, deputy secretary at the state government\u2019s urban development department, Sudhakar Bobade said that the cities had declared details about the number of applications filed for individual household latrine (IHHL) and the number of IHHLs constructed on the Swachh Bharat Mission portal. \u201cThe cities are expected to bridge the gap between the number of applications filed and the toilets constructed by June 30,\u201d said Bobade. He further said that the urban local bodies (ULBs) had to ensure that the community and public toilets in the city were in good shape. First, the ULBs should ensure that the existing toilets are repaired and have light, water and are properly cleaned. The cities applying for ODF+ should have atleast 10% and those applying for ODF++ should have atleast 25% toilets with additional facilities like exhaust fan, vending machines and other amenities. \u201cThere will be a three phase inspection for ODF+ and ODF++ in which the municipal commissioner will have to make a self-declaration about the status of public and community toilets. After this, the divisional coordinator of Swachh Bharat will inspect and finally a third party inspection by Delhi based QCI will be conducted,\u201d said Bobade. He said that Aurangabad would have to meet ODF++ requirements before October 2 i.e. the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Vijaya Ghadge, who is overseeing the ODF status of the city, said that AMC would be repairing around 30 existing public toilets and constructing 25 new ones.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future? What new has she brought in?\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}}
