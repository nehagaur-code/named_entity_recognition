A surprise pick by the ruling BJP-led NDA   , Birla's name was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself for the post, sources said. The 56-year-old leader is considered to be close to both Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah. Birla's nomination for the Lok Sabha Speaker's post also has the   backing of non-NDA parties   such as the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). Starting his political journey as a student leader, Birla was also elected to the Rajasthan Assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. He won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was again elected this year from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. Birla defeated Congress's Ramnarayan Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently-concluded general election. A conscientious parliamentarian, Birla has registered an 86-per cent average attendance in the House, asked 671 questions, participated in 163 debates and introduced six private members' bills in the 16th Lok Sabha. From 1991 to 2003, he was a key leader in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) as a state-level president first and then, as a vice-president at the national level. Birla, who holds a Masters degree in commerce, is a member of the Standing Committee on Energy in Parliament, the Committee on Petitions and the Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. He succeeds eight-time MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Lok Sabha Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this is not the first time that a relative newcomer has occupied the position. In 1996, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader G M C Balayogi, also a two-time MP then, was elected as the Speaker in the Lower House of Parliament. After his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

Health officials conceded that none of the kids, who have survived the deadly \u2018chamki bukhar\u2019 or are undergoing treatment, has been provided assistance under Ayushman Bharat \u2014 a flagship scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY). A senior official in the state health department confirmed that treatment of AES can be covered under the scheme. PMJAY, launched during the first term of the Modi government, provides an annual health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family to nearly 50 crore people from 10.74 crore \u2018deprived\u2019 families selected on the basis of socio-economic and caste census data. Bihar government\u2019s Mukhya Mantri Chikitsa Sahayta Kosh Yojna is also aimed at providing monetary assistance to the poor for medical treatment of the disease. However, both these initiatives failed to come to the rescue. Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Shailesh Prasad Singh told TOI on Wednesday that no applications of AES patients were received either at the state government- run Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) or the trust-run Krishnadevi Deviprasad Kejriwal Maternity Hospital. G S Sahni, head of pediatrics department at SKMCH, said treatment of AES cases is covered under both the central and the state schemes.  \u201cSKMCH as well as KDKMH are listed under Ayushman Bharat scheme along with all 16 primary health centres (PHCs) two additional PHCs, two referral hospitals in the district are listed Ayushman Bharat scheme,\u201d he said, adding that 10 private hospitals in the district are also enlisted listed for treating people under the central scheme. Incidentally, none of the private hospitals listed under Ayushman Bharat scheme have pediatric intensive care units and only two of them have general ICUs. Relatives of a number of children admitted at SKMCH and KDKMH claimed that they have not even been issued the health cards under Ayushman Bharat scheme. \u201cWe have not been issued health card for getting treated under Ayushman Bharat scheme. Hence, we have not applied for it,\u201d said Poona Devi, whose son Raushan Raj (5) succumbed to the deadly disease on June 14. Devi is a resident of Dariapur Kafen village under Kanti block of the district. On being asked about getting the ailing children treated at the ICUs of private hospitals, Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh said it cannot be done due to technical and administrative issues. \u201cWe cannot shift the children from PICUs of SKMCH to any private hospital because it will create chaos at management level. If any death occurs at those hospitals, we cannot fix the responsibility on anyone. Even having an eye of treatment procedure at those private hospitals would be a hectic and lengthy task. So, we are not preferring to shift the children to a private nursing home,\u201d Ghosh said. The DM added that it has also been observed that the Matrisadan hospital has been referring the cases to SKMCH in the eleventh hour. \u201cIt becomes very difficult to save the life of the kid, when they are referred to SKMCH in critical condition,\u201d Ghosh said. Health experts also claimed that the outbreak of the disease also showed failure of the state and central government to spread awareness about its prevention. \u201cAES has been occurring from over past two decades and few common causes have been identified as low glucose level and malnutrition and its occurrence in peak summer season. But the disease still claimed lives of over 100 children, this year.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Dr Gopal Shankar Sahni, head of paediatrics department at SKMCH, said several teams of experts and doctors from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi, National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, and All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi and Patna have come to Muzaffarpur to study the cases and find the cause of AES, which has been occurring during peak summer and pre-monsoon season in the north Bihar district since 1994-95. Incidentally, most of these agencies and organizations had conducted studies on the disease in the past as well. \u201cThey are taking blood, urine and throat sob samples of the affected children. Besides, they will be studying the profile of the victims and their food habits, common places of occurrence of the disease, among others,\u201d Dr Sahni told TOI on Tuesday. He said researchers have so far failed to reach any conclusion. He attributed the disease to extreme heat and humidity. \u201cThe AES outbreak mostly happened when the maximum temperature remained above 38 degrees C and humidity was in the range of 60-70% and above,\u201d he said. Patna-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) doctor has suggested brain biopsy and tissue culture of the victims to know the cause of AES deaths. \u201cFollowing the inspection of SKMCH by Union health minister recently, the state government had asked IGIMS to suggest steps for finding the cause of the disease. Based on a detailed study and deliberations on researches done by agencies across the globe on the disease in Muzaffarpur, we have recommended brain biopsy in death cases and brain tissue biopsy in case of fever,\u201d IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal told TOI. He said majority of the researches have been based on blood samples only. Doctors at SKMCH, however, claimed the studies conducted in the past were not based on blood samples only. \u201cThe researches conducted by the NIV-Pune, NCDC and CDC-Atlanta between 2011 and 2013 were based on a number of samples, including blood, urine, cerebrospinal sasal fluid, rectal sob, nasal sob and throat secretin. NIV, in fact, had conducted even brain biopsy in one case. However, no virus was found to be the cause of the disease in any of the studies and viral encephalitis was ruled out. The studies put the disease in the category of non-inflammatory encephalopathy,\u201d Dr Sahni said. On being asked why brain biopsy was not done in suspected AES cases, Dr Sahni said: \u201cBiopsy and other forms of autopsies are done only in the case of unnatural deaths. However, the AES deaths are natural due to some disease,\u201d he said. The other researches on the AES, locally known as \u2018Chamki Bukhar (high fever with seizure)\u2019, include those published in journals of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta and The Lancet Global Health medical journal in 2017. Different studies and researches have blamed different causes of the disease, including malnourishment, binge-eating litchi on empty stomach and even heatstroke. Muzaffarpur-based Dr Arun Shah, who is a member of national executive committee of the Indian Paediatrics Association, said the CDC study had attributed the disease to acute hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, which is caused due to extreme low level of blood glucose in the body. \u201cUnder-nutrition is a common trend observed in most of the children suffering from the AES as they belong to poor families. The CDC, in its recommendations, had advised parents of the area not to allow their children to venture out in the orchards and feed them properly before going to sleep,\u201d said Dr Shah. Parents of several victims also accepted under-nutrition. Nunu Mahto, who lost his 4-year-old son Prince on June 10 due to AES, said his son had consumed nothing on June 7 night. He was convulsing next morning. \u201cWe tried to admit him to Kanti primary health centre, but they did not respond. Finally, we took him to SKMCH where he died,\u201d Nunu said.

The report observed that nine ventilators were present but not made operational at SKMCH and no ventilators were present in Kejriwal Hospital. It added that current manpower were \"inadequate in quantity and quality\" to handle the situation. The team advised better protocol-based management of AES to bring down mortality, improved use of case monitoring sheets and better prioritising of serious and not-so-serious cases to ensure optimal use of resources. It has also recommended constituting a research team from the National Centre for Disease Control, Indian Council for Medical Research, AIIMS Patna, National Institute of Virology, Pune and Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna to focus research not only on the children who have been admitted with AES but also others within the same geographical area to understand the risks. On the speculation that there may be a link with lychee, the report said that while earlier studies had inferred that this may be connected to the presence of a specific toxin in the fruit, \"the work was not sufficient to prove that the toxin is causative for all cases\". The multi-specialist team included Dr Arun Singh, national advisor in the health ministry and Dr Ram Singh, an entomologist from National Centre for Disease Control, among others.

The state government on Tuesday took a decision to depute at least one BFS officer in each department to take care of financial issues, said deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi after the review meeting of the finance department by CM Nitish Kumar. Modi, who also holds the finance portfolio, said with the introduction of Comprehensive Finance Management System (CFMS), all financial transactions in the state government has become online and different offices of finance department have become \u2018paperless\u2019. As the result, nearly 100 BFS officers who were earlier deputed in different treasuries, have become redundant. The government decided to open finance section in each department to utilize the services of these officers. He said the State Bank of India (SBI) was earlier working as \u2018agency bank\u2019 in the state. Now, the SBI has no role to play in transaction of salaries in the bank account of state government employees. He said salaries in the employees\u2019 bank accounts were being transferred directly from the Reserve Bank of India after introduction of the CFMS. Speaking at the review meeting, the CM stressed the need for better financial management in the state and asked the finance department to be prepared to take additional \u2018liabilities\u2019 in the wake of people\u2019s growing aspirations and demands. \u201cPeoples\u2019 income in the state is increasing. The purchasing power of even middle class people has increased. The market status has improved a lot across the state. These are indicators of economic progress. In such a scenario, the finance department should be ready to take additional liabilities.\u201d Earlier, principal secretary (finance) S Siddharth made a PowerPoint presentation before the CM about different steps taken by the department for better financial management.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Even as the state government blames hypoglycemia as the cause for most deaths, doctors, public health experts and researchers have raised concerns over the government's failure to contain the rapidly rising death toll from the disease. More than 112 children have died due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in the past fortnight and many more are feared infected in Muzaffarpur and the adjoining districts in Bihar. This has also compelled the Union health ministry to send different teams to probe and ascertain the exact cause, strengthen surveillance and measures in the affected districts. Ten paediatricians (including five senior consultants) and five para-medics from RML Hospital, Safdarjung and Lady Hardinge Medical College are part of the five teams set up by health ministry. The teams also include clinical and public health experts from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), National Institute of Nutrition and UN agencies. \"As of now, we do not have much clue about the exact cause of these deaths. However, we are working on several possibilities and are hopeful of zeroing on it in a day or two,\" a senior official from ICMR told TOI. Experts say there can be a clutch of factors causing AES including viruses, bacteria, fungus, parasites, chemicals, toxins and non-infectious agents. Though litchis are being seen as a primary cause, researchers say the fruit can only be a contributing factor and not the cause. Instead, prolonged malnourishment, the current heat wave, poor hygiene and lack of awareness about litchi consumption may have led to the significant number of deaths among children, mainly less than five year old. \"Litchi cannot be the cause. There is a particular component in the fruit which can contribute to reducing blood sugar level if too many litchis are consumed in an empty stomach,\" said a public health expert working in Muzaffarpur. Official data suggest the Bihar government has been indifferent towards improving child nutrition and healthcare in this district. In Muzaffarpur, nearly 48% children under the age of 5 are stunted, 17.5% are wasted (too thin for their height), while 42% are underweight--a glaring sign of chronic undernutrition, according to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4. The data also show merely 7.8% children aged 6-23 months receive an adequate diet in Muzaffarpur. While breastfeeding rates are better, the breastfeeding rate in the first hour of birth is poor. Moreover, maternal health indicators are also poor leading to inadequate nutrition for the child despite improving rate of breastfeeding. Every third women (15-49 years) in Muzaffarpur district is malnourished, having body mass index (BMI) below the normal level. Government reports show that 33% women in this age group in Muzaffarpur district are underweight. Experts also pointed at the poor health infrastructure as another major factor leading to deaths. \"Delay in care seeking is also a major factor for increasing number of deaths. There is lack of information and awareness. Patients from villages are rushing to town to seek treatment at tertiary care and losing time in the process. If they go to the nearest health centre or clinic, they can get immediate care and the situation can be controlled,\" another expert with an international health agency said. He added, encephalitis fever usually starts during night and by morning the symptoms are severe, once the fever reaches the brain and damages it, the situation is difficult to tackle even in tertiary care hospitals. So, it is imperative to access care at the earliest.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Reena Devi (35), a resident of Kankerbagh in the city, was seething with anger as she had to run from pillar to post for the treatment of her 13-year-old daughter Rita, who was suffering from high fever. The main entrance gate of the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), where she was waiting with her daughter, was closed due to the doctors\u2019 strike. \u201cYahan garibon ka koi sudh lene wala nahi hai (nobody is here to take care of the poor),\u201d a visibly angry Reena said.

The Patna high court division bench of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Anjana Mishra made the verbal remark while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Vikash Chandra alias Guddu Baba. The court, while taking strong exception to the issue, suggested the authorities concerned to settle the vendors encroaching upon public roads in front of the residences of ministers so that people could be spared of their sufferings. The petitioner had urged the court to direct the authorities concerned to get rid of roadside encroachments on Ashok Rajpath, Bari Path, Hathua and Lalji markets and the stretch between Pataliputra Colony and Digha road. These encroachments, according to the petitioner, lead to massive traffic snarls in the city. The high court asked the state government to file a counter affidavit by Monday, informing it about the current status of construction of vending zones and settlement of roadside encroachers. The court slammed the government for reappearance of encroachers on roads due to lack of proper vending zones for them. The issue of illegal settlement made below Rajendra Nagar overbridge by the then Patna DM U K Sinha on July 22, 1988, also surfaced during Tuesday\u2019s hearing. The high court had directed the state government to file a reply on the issue on January 15 this year. Patna DM, who filed a counter affidavit on behalf of chief secretary, informed the court that the state government had ordered removal of those living below the bridge at a meeting held recently. Sinha had allowed 214 people to live below the bridge in 1988.

Even as more and more cases are being brought in to the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital in Muzaffarpur, where bulk of the patients are undergoing treatment, the hospital continues to be hampered by lack of proper facilities despite high-profile visits by ministers, including the CM and the Union health minister. TimesViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicentre. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.Scarcity of beds and doctors coupled with unhygienic condition prevailed at the hospital even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses, who have been deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital in Muzaffarpur. \u201cAll 637 beds, including 30 in PICUs, in the hospital are full. We have to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\u201d SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there is a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \u201cThough there is a shortage, it is inhuman to throw out patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES \u2026 come every day. But our resources are very limited.\u201d To ease the situation, a makeshift paediatrics intensive care unit with 20 new beds and four new ACs were set up on Wednesday amid frequent power cuts. Hospital authorities said 154 children are undergoing treatment for AES at the three PICUs with 10 beds each with fresh cases coming in from neighbouring districts. In Vaishali, civil surgeon I D Ranjan claimed that 15 suspected cases of AES have been reported from Hajipur as well. \u201cSeveral kids have died in their villages, while others died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. However, their relatives claimed that they showed similar symptoms of high fever and convulsion among others,\u201d Ranjan told TOI. In Samastipur, at least three of the seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital, were referred to SKMCH, one of whom died on the way. However, civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied admitting any AES patients at the hospital. Meanwhile, the death of 2-year old child at a village in Katoria block of Banka district due to suspected AES raised alarm in the health department. However, To cope with the situation in Muzaffarpur, DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \u201cThe total number of affected and admitted children has gone up to 5,530 since June 1 this year alone. Though, 187 kids have been discharged from the hospital; 101 children are still undergoing treatment at two medical institutions of the district. The conditions of 24 children are critical and have been kept on ventilators,\u201d Ghosh said. \u201cA massive awareness campaign has been started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekaa.

Dariapur in Kanti block of Muzaffarpur has dalit and mahadalit population. It has been one of the worst affected villages in the district. The village with a population of hardly 3000 people lacks basic infrastructure even when the government claims all-round development up to hamlets level. Subodh Paswan, whose daughter Nidhi (5) died due to AES earlier this month, blamed lack of medical facilities at local public health centre (PHC). \u201cWe took Nidhi to the PHC but they refused to admit her and referred her to SKMCH where she was declared dead. The doctors at SKMCH said her life could have been saved had she been brought a bit earlier,\u201d Paswan said. Sanjay Kumar, another resident of Dariyapur, said the PHC remains open only for three to four days in a month. \u201cComplaints have been lodged with the block officials, but in vain,\u201d he added. Similar was the situation in Damodari, Ramur Sah and other villages from where majority of the AES cases have been reported. Most villagers are either daily wagers or agricultural labourers. Most children seldom go to the nearby Anganwadi centres as they remain open for hardly a couple of days in a month. So, they are deprived of nutritional foods supposed to be distributed through these centres. People have now started preventing their kids from going out in scorching heat, fearing fatal consequences. Even children and parents from urban pockets are apprehensive about the disease. \u201cWe are not sure whether this disease will affect our children or not as no urban locality has been hit by AES so far. We are taking precautionary measures and have asked our children not to go out in scorching heat unless necessary,\u201d said Prabhakar Kumar, a resident of Brahmin Toli under the Town police station area of Muzaffarpur. But, in rural areas of the district, every second family is afraid of getting their ward sick and keeps children indoors. \u201cWe try our best to not let our wards move out during day time. We are also trying to ensure that our children must not go to the litchi orchards,\u201d said Sakal Paswan of Dariapur Kafen under the Kanti police station area. Also, the tall claims of district health officials of providing manpower and infrastructure to the PHCs and additional PHCs along with referral hospitals of the district seem hollow as majority of the 16 PHCs are reeling from acute shortage of medical experts, nursing staff, apart from beds and other facilities, including medicines. The deadly disease, which was first reported in Bihar at Muzaffarpur in 1994-95, has spread its wings to neighbouring districts of Sitamarhi, Sheohar, East Champaran, West Champaran, Vaishali and Samastipur as well.

Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village.

In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'.

According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

In its daily all-India weather bulletin issued on Tuesday evening, the IMD stated that scattered rainfall would occur in Bihar from June 20 and it would intensity into fairly widespread rainfall by June 22. The Patna Meteorological Centre has predicted that maximum temperature in the city would remain below 40-degree mark from June 21 onwards. \u201cThe monsoon current is active in north-eastern and eastern parts of the country. The expected increase in the intensity of rainfall in Bihar around June 22 indicates onset of the rain-bearing winds,\u201d said a senior official at Patna Meteorological Centre. Monsoon normally enters Bihar through north-eastern districts of Purnia and Kishanganj around June 10-12 and covers the entire state by June 15. However, the overall onset of monsoon in the country was delayed this year as the rain-bearing winds hit Kerala coast on June 8 instead of its normal date of June 1. The pre-monsoon showers were much low this time in most parts of Bihar, except few north-eastern districts. Lack of showers and clear skies led to direct penetration of solar rays and pushed the maximum temperature above 40-degree mark at most places in the state. The unprecedented heatwave has so far claimed 83 lives in four districts of the state. The thundershowers in Patna late on Monday night also did not provide much respite from the scorching heat as mercury remained on the higher side on Tuesday as well. With a maximum temperature of 41.8 degrees Celsius, Gaya was the hottest place in the state on Tuesday. Patna, on the other hand, recorded a maximum temperature of 41.4 degrees Celsius. The Patna Meteorological Centre stated that heatwave prevailed at few places in south Bihar, north-east and north-central part of the state in the last 24 hours. The daily heatwave bulletin issued by IMD also stated that heatwave conditions were observed at some places in the state. Maximum temperatures were markedly above normal (5.1 degrees C or more) at a few places in the state. Heatwave has been predicted in some parts of the state on Wednesday as well.

While over 112 children below the age of 10 years died due to suspected Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) in Muzaffarpur and its adjoining districts in north Bihar, more than 90 people lost their lives due to heatstroke in Aurangabad, Gaya, Nawada and Jamui districts in south and central Bihar. However, the unofficial records show much high casualties in the two separate tragedies. The situation can be gauged from the fact that only 3.94% of the state\u2019s total expenditure is for health, which is the second lowest after Haryana. On the contrary, its neighbouring state Uttar Pradesh spends 5.07% of its total expenditure on healthcare. Moreover, the per capita expenditure on health is lowest in the state at Rs.495 compared to Rs 733 in Uttar Pradesh, the third lowest in the country. According to authoritative sources, there are 11,373 sanctioned posts of doctors in the state. But almost 50% of the posts are still vacant. The magnitude of the problem can be gauged from the fact that only one doctor was on duty when people with complaints of heatstroke started rushing to the Aurangabad sadar hospital for treatment last week. Statistics available with the health department revealed that only 12 doctors were serving at Aurangabad sadar hospital against sanctioned strength of 45. Similarly, 16% of the sanctioned strength of the doctors were posted in Sitamarhi district, which is in the grip of AES. The situation is no better in Patna, Vaishali and Bhojpur districts. Till date 41 people have died due to heatstroke in Aurangabad followed by 35 in Gaya, 12 in Nawada and two in Jamui districts. Majority of the deceased were above the age of 60 years. Former chief secretary of united Bihar V S Dubey said, \u201c It\u2019s a fact the state's budget in health sector is very low compared to other states. But what is more important is that whatever the infrastructure the state has, is not being utilized properly and effectively. The result is obvious. It\u2019s high time the government should take notice of it and improve the condition accordingly.\u201d Dubey expressed concern over doctors\u2019 strike on one pretext or the other. \u201c There have been instances when relatives and attendants of patients were assaulted by doctors in the government hospitals for asking for proper care of their patients. On the other hand, doctors are too beaten up by the attendants. It\u2019s two way. It shouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d he added. Referring to the AES deaths in Muzaffarpur and its adjoining districts, the ex-chief secretary said over 1000 children have died in the state ever since the brain fever or \u2018chamki bukhar\u2019 was detected in the state in 1994-95. The situation has not improved even today and children belonging to lower strata are dying everyday. State health minister Mangal Pandey admitted that there was dearth of doctors in government hospitals. He, however, said that appointment of around 1000 medical officers, 2200 specialist doctors, 6300 ANMs and 558 dentists was on the cards. \u201cCertain changes have been brought about in the appointment/selection rules to expedite the process,\u201d he said. \u201cEarlier, all appointments in the health department were made through the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC), which is already over burdened with lots of vacancies in different government departments. Now, the Bihar Technical Service Commission (BTSC) has been set up by the government for appointment of doctors, medical officers and other employees health department,\u201d Pandey said. Besides, efforts were on to improve the infrastructure as well. Three new medical colleges in Purnia, Chhapra (Saran) and Samastipur would be set up in the state soon. Altogether 11 medical colleges are proposed to be opened in Bihar.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Sushmita Sen": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/sushmita-sen-shares-adorable-moments-with-daughters-from-brother-rajeev-sens-wedding/videoshow/69863882.cms", "description": ""}, "Asus 6Z": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/asus-6z-to-launch-in-india-today-heres-how-to-watch-the-live-stream/articleshow/69851301.cms", "description": ""}, "Girls worried over safety in public transport": {"description": "PATNA: The alleged rape of a married woman by e-rickshaw drivers near Rajendra Nagar overbridge around 2am on Tuesday has raised questions on night police patrolling and safety of women and girls in the city.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.
