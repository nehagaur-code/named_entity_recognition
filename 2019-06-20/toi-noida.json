You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

There has been lack of upgraded infrastructure and accountability on the part of the power department in the district. Despite paying hefty bills, we are facing 4-8 hours of power cuts every day. How can a tariff hike be justified in a situation where the power department is unable to provide regular supply?\u201d asked NP Singh, president of the Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA). Apart from the 20% increase in power tariff across slabs, the UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) has also suggested a hike in the fixed charge from Rs 90 per KW to Rs 110. If implemented, this will lead to a steep increase in power bills \u2014 a monthly bill of, say, Rs 3,000 will rise to around Rs 4,000. In the tariff proposal submitted to UP Electricity Regulatory Commission, UPPCL has recommended the highest increase of 26% in the lowest slab of 0-150 units, raising it from Rs 4.90 per unit to Rs 6.20. The tariff for the 151-300 units slab is proposed to be hiked from Rs 5.40 to Rs 6.50 per unit. According to the RWA federation president, the hike is all the more unjustified in a district that pays the highest revenue and steep electricity bills. \u201cNoida is a \u2018no power cut zone\u2019, which is required for promotion of industry. It\u2019s also an area which provides the maximum revenue. Then, why should it be subjected to a tariff hike? We oppose the proposal and will take up the matter with chief minister Yogi Adityanath. We will approach Prime Minister Narendra Modi, if needed,\u201d said NP Singh. Greater Noida resident Alok Kumar suggested that the power department should instead focus on laying underground cables, upgrading old transformers, replacing rusting poles, panel boxes and increasing load capacities of substations. \u201cWe congratulate the district magistrate for the felicitation in revenue collection, but strongly oppose the hike in tariff,\u201d said Kumar. District magistrate Singh maintained that the hike was in the proposal stage. \u201cThe tariff hike proposal pertains to the power department. Residents should raise their concerns regarding tariff etc with them or the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Committee. It does not fall under my jurisdiction,\u201d said Singh, adding that he was only authorised for revenue collection.

A major survey is currently on to determine whether an underpass or a flyover can be constructed to ease traffic at the roundabout, officials said. The move comes after previous experiments failed to reduce congestion at the busy intersection and in the wake of the Greater Noida Authority approving the extension of the Aqua Line with a proposed station in Sector 123 at the Parthala Chowk. The metro extension project is expected to kick off later this year. \u201cParthala roundabout is a key junction in Noida. We are currently carrying out the survey. And once we get the report, we will take a call on whether an underpass or a flyover would be able to provide smooth connectivity from Ghaziabad to Noida and Greater Noida via the FNG corridor,\u201d KK Aggarwal, Authority\u2019s general manager, told TOI. \u201cThe decongestion project at the junction entails an investment of Rs 90 crore. We will spend the money once we finalise a structure on the basis of the feasibility survey report,\u201d he added. Experts also agree. Naveen Sharma of Medulla Soft Technologies that submitted a traffic feasibility report on the area to Noida Authority in March this year, said that while about 7,000 to 8,000 vehicles ply every hour in the area during day time, the number increases to about 18,000 during peak hours. \u201cWe had recommended reducing the circumference of the roundabout and other minor alterations. But in the long run, a graded separation by way of a flyover or an underpass is the eventual option for the intersection, especially since metro connectivity is planned in the area,\u201d he added. Residents of highrise apartments in the vicinity of Parthala Chowk say unclogging the roundabout is the need of the hour. \u201cCongestion at the busy intersection is increasing with each passing day. The Noida Authority must take a concrete step to ease traffic snarls at the roundabout once and for all,\u201d said Sanjeev Dixit, a resident of Sector 121. Currently, the Parthala Chowk connects many areas and is a main connecting point for Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. While it has traffic coming from Ghaziabad in the north side of the roundabout, its east side has the busy Kisan Chowk. The south of the roundabout caters to Surajpur area of Greater Noida, including the collectorate and the police headquarters, and its west side has traffic coming from Sector 71 and beyond, including the populated 7x sectors as well as the industrial sectors of 62 and 63.

The flying squad will be checking multiple spots every day to ensure solid waste management rules are properly implemented. \u201cThe warning boards mention that anyone found littering or dumping waste will be penalised and can be imprisoned. We have already penalised a few offenders. There is a huge task ahead as we need to get all these spots cleaned,\u201d said SC Mishra, senior manager at the Noida Authority. Officials said that left unchecked, people have now got used to throwing garbage at these points and keep coming back to using them, making it difficult to clean these in one go. The move to keep tabs on these spots comes after the UP solid waste management monitoring committee chairperson, Justice (retired) D P Singh, visited the city last week. He ordered that waste along roads was a common sight in Noida and the Authority would be penalised if these are not cleared by June 30. \u201cThe committee had observed that there were garbage piles along roads across the city. They said that it impacted overall public health. They gave two major orders. One was to clean these spots by June 30 and the other was to ensure segregation of waste at source,\u201d said an official from Noida Authority. The Authority had earlier asked all RWAs, malls, hospitals, hotels and industries to start segregation at source. It had also ordered that after June 30, only dry segregated waste will be picked up from residential areas. The RWAs are expected to use composting machines to manage wet waste internally. While residents claimed that it was difficult to start segregation immediately, officials said they were hopeful of meeting the deadline. \u201cWe have been speaking to RWAs regarding waste segregation and I have personally met members of over 20 RWAs.

A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

But the new-age dads, who stay in nuclear as well as joint families, where both husband and wife are working, are not only dividing the task of raising kids equally, but also making sure that they are available for their kids for a heart-to-heart conversation, advice on friendships, or period talks. From taking leaves for kids\u2019 exams to cooking and helping them with homework \u2013 things that one would typically expect a mother would do \u2013 are being done by dads quite well, who believe in not just sharing finances, but other responsibilities, too. On Father\u2019s Day, we speak to some dads and mothers leading by example, who tell us about the stereotypes that fathers are subjected to, and how they are breaking them and contributing as an equal parent. Dads not emotional, says who?Ankur Gupta, a doctor and resident of Sector 50, Gurgaon, says, \u201cFathers are not sensitive, kids turn to their mothers if they want to express their feelings; fathers are messy, don\u2019t help in household chores; they are not interested in school grades, and are uncomfortable in parent-teacher meetings \u2013 these are some common stereotypes that most fathers in India are subjected to. Thankfully, these are not applicable to me as at a very early age my daughter realised that she could walk up to me and talk about anything that is bothering her emotionally. I am also interested in knowing about what is happening in her school. There is no division of labour at our home but my wife and I know about the things we are good at, so we take the lead accordingly. I know I am good at language and my wife can manage the finances well, so it is like an unsaid rule that we follow to help our family in that way.\u201d Tilak Chowdhury, a resident of Sector 169, Noida, who works at a consulting firm, adds, \u201cThe stereotypes are not restricted to just, dads can\u2019t cook or look after the kids, often, they are also considered very strict and someone who cannot have fun, or show any emotion in front of their kids. Why can\u2019t people expect a father to be like Anupam Kher\u2019s character in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge who can encourage his kids when they fail, or do not perform well in studies, or can discuss their love lives openly like Rishi Kapoor\u2019s character in Hum Tum?\u201d Can\u2019t discuss heartbreaks with dads \u2013 seriously? You cannot discuss problems related to heartbreaks or seek advice after a fight with friends with your father as they won\u2019t understand them \u2013 new-age dads are trying to break this stereotype. \u201cWe understand and can give useful advice to the kids. Why do people find it so difficult to accept that fathers can also have emotions and kids can have a conversation with us on topics related to heartbreaks or can seek any other emotional advice? I have always been available to my kids whenever they have wanted me. I remember that my elder daughter, now 15, would return disturbed from school. One day, I asked her about what was bothering her as I was concerned. I did not mean to interfere in her personal life, but I told her that she could come up to me whenever she was comfortable talk about it, and I would try to help her in all my capacity. It took her two days to tell me that she was facing problems with a friend, who would often fight with her on petty issues. I told her that it was important to focus on the friendship if it was important to them, they can fight over petty issues but school days won\u2019t come back. We started with this topic and then she opened up about her school life and her friends from the neighbourhood. I was glad that she could tell me everything. That day, my daughter understood that she can discuss her problems with me and I will try to help her,\u201d shares Arjun Singh, a businessman who lives in Rajouri Garden and father to two teenage daughters. Arpana Prakash, who runs a dance school, adds, \u201cWhen I asked my seven-year-old daughter about who would she first tell about her boyfriend, and she said, \u2018Dad.\u2019 That is the comfort level that they share. We could never think about having a talk about menstruation with our fathers but today\u2019s generation surely can.\u201d \u2018Can take care of kids and deal with clients\u2019Raj Hazarika says that he is often asked why he willingly contributes as a homemaker. \u201cThis is something that they expect a woman to do but I like cooking and also enjoy doing it for my kids. Playing, cooking or just being with my kids is important as they are growing up, and this time will never come back. Raising kids is not an easy task, and there is nothing wrong in being equally involved with your partner in doing so. One has to adjust a lot while dealing with kids. I can manage my clients or colleagues easily but dealing with kids and their temperament is another thing \u2013 something that every parent should learn hands- on,\u201d says Raj, a resident of Sushant Lok 2 who runs a coaching academy. For some, it is also a way to bond with their kids. \u201cMy wife is a teacher and she leaves around 6.30am, so I wake up early before my kids leave for school and pack their lunch. I leave for work around 10am, so I have enough time to spend with my kids. We both are working parents, so I don\u2019t see it as a problem that I am cooking for my kids. When I come from work, my kids are often asleep because my wife is with them after school and helps them with the homework. If I have my Saturdays off, then I help them with their homework or extra-curricular activities but that is something I want to do as a parent, and not because somebody is forcing me to. People can think that I am too involved in my family but I am doing this because this is what I want to do,\u201d says Roshan Sharma, a resident of Saket, who works as a consultant in a firm.

Officials said this would not only generate a source of income for villagers, but also expand green cover in the district. As of now, the project has been planned for 88 villages. The officials said there was a growing demand for timber because of an expanding realty market and allowing it to be grown legally was the best way to meet the requirement. The trees that they are being encouraged to plant take almost 10 years to mature and their wood fetches good returns. \u201cWe are starting a series of informative and interactive sessions in villages of the district where we will inform villagers how to put their vacant land to use and grow trees as a mode of investment. People do not need permission of the forest department to cut some varieties of trees such as phicus, poplar and eucalyptus.

But Ishika Singh, Anuj Shukla and Anshul Kaushik won\u2019t walk out of jail yet because they have been booked in two FIRs, only one of which the court has ruled on. The court of additional district and sessions judge Nalin Kant Tyagi on Wednesday heard arguments in the defamation case filed by police against the trio for the show on the CM. The judge granted bail after submission of two sureties of Rs 40,000 each. The other case, which relates to charges of forgery and cheating and was registered because Nation Live, the channel, was allegedly found not to have the requisite permits, was heard by fast track court judge Ved Prakash Verma. The order has been reserved. The court asked the three news channel staffers not to seek a postponement of hearing during statements of witnesses and ensure presence either in person or through their lawyers on the dates of hearing. According to Nitin Gupta and Parth Upadhayay, lawyers for Shukla and Kaushik, respectively, they argued in court there was nothing defamatory in the TV discussion that was aired on June 6 and the channel had, in fact, tried to expose a woman who has been making controversial claims about the CM and also whether she was part of any political conspiracy. The woman featured on the programme through a dial-in. \u201cWe contended before the court that while the FIR states that the channel\u2019s show was solely aimed at provoking members of a party, there were no riots even after two days of the discussion being aired as against what the police report anticipated. No complaint was lodged by any of the party members and despite allegations of defamation, the CM did not lodge an FIR but it was a policeman who did so,\u201d Gupta said, adding they had also apprised the judge that the arrested trio was not produced before a court even 48 hours after their detention. The arrests took place after the local administration put together a report that saw the possibility of a law and order problem as a result of the show being aired. The office of Nation Live in Sector 63 was sealed on the same weekend as the arrests of Shukla and Ishika (June 8/9). Kaushik was arrested the following week. The FIR relating to defamation was filed on the complaint of a sub-inspector. The other was based on an inquiry by the district information department\u2019s assistant director, Meena Biswas. The government counsel opposed bail, stating that the channel had aired a discussion on the CM, who is at a level where \u201ceven a small aspersion can spoil the situation of society\u201d, and that it was a \u201ccrime serious in nature\u201d. But the court said the discussion did not seem to cause enmity, hatred and disaffection in society. \u201cThe accused are in jail since June 9 (Ishika and Anuj) and June 11 (Anshul). Looking at the facts, there are sufficient grounds to grant bail without commenting on the merits/demerits of the case,\u201d reads the court order. The court noted that the lawyers had contended that the trio had been \u201cframed\u201d and \u201cthey had no ill-intention in airing the discussion\u201d.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

If implemented, this will lead to a steep increase in power bills \u2014 a monthly bill of, say, Rs 3,000 will rise to around Rs 4,000. In the tariff proposal submitted to UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC), UPPCL has recommended the highest increase of 26% in the lowest slab of 0-150 units, raising it from Rs 4.90 per unit to Rs 6.20. The tariff for the 151-300 units slab is proposed to be hiked from Rs 5.40 to Rs 6.50 per unit. Similarly, urban households consuming 301 to 500 units per month will have to shell out Rs 7 per unit instead of Rs 6.20, and those with consumption higher than 500 units will have to pay Rs 7.50 per unit. Sources in UPERC said there will be a public hearing and, as per procedure, a public notice will be issued inviting objections from people. Principal secretary (energy) Alok Kumar said the hike was proposed in view of the rise in input cost of power. \u201cThere has been an increase in the cost of coal and fuel. The cost of maintaining transmission and generation infrastructure has also gone up,\u201d he told TOI. The last power tariff hike of around 12% was implemented in 2017, six months after BJP stormed to power in UP with an overwhelming majority. There was no tariff hike in 2018. Not surprisingly, the proposed hike has raised hackles of consumers. UP Rajya Upbhogta Parishad president A K Verma said that proposed hike was extremely high. \u201cThe power corporation has been putting the burden on consumers to hide its own inefficiency,\u201d he said.

Noida is a profit-making centre and an increase in charges will be completely unjustified,\u201d said A N Dhawan, secretary general of FONRWA, the umbrella body of RWAs in the city. He also said FONRWA had already written to the UPERC to declare Noida a profit centre and reduce tariff. \u201cThe power department is already unable to provide the required amount of electricity in Noida, while there is full recovery and good revenue from here.

The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing. Living with the dead: A grave in the backyard\"All we are asking for is some land for our ancestors. There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar. Their burial grounds are filled to capacity,\" said Nizam Khan, a mechanic. Village pradhan Sundar Kumar said that he had asked officials several times for a burial ground for Muslim families, but no action was taken. Ravi Kumar NG, the district magistrate, said that he was not aware of the issue. \"I will send an official team to the village and get details of the burial land required.\" Picture Credit: Hemant Kumar In Video:Houses turn into graveyards as Muslims in this UP village bury the dead at homeDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Ashton Kutcher": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/hollywood/news/ashton-kutcher-and-mila-kunis-trash-split-rumours-in-the-funniest-way-possible/articleshow/69868560.cms", "description": ""}, "Unauthorised parking": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/unauthorisedparking/articleshow/65361137.cms", "description": ""}, "Mahagathbandhan": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/news/arun-jaitley-calls-mahagathbandhan-a-political-circus-recipe-for-chaos/articleshow/68633012.cms", "description": "NEW DELHI: Taking a swipe at the grand alliance of opposition parties, finance minister Arun Jaitley on Friday said the 'mahagathbandhan' is a 'non-bandhan', political circus and a recipe for chaos. Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

Everyone in America knew what happened,\u201d explained the photographer. It\u2019s not as if ice hockey was a popular game in the US but such was the hype for the game \u2013 played at the height of the Cold War \u2013 that even Americans who had never watched ice hockey before or didn\u2019t even know the rules tuned in for it. Many Indians would find this scenario familiar. Because today, they will do the same as India and Pakistan face off in an epic Cricket World Cup game (unless the rain has other plans). Cricket might be a religion in India, but there still are plenty of atheists around, many of whom don\u2019t even understand cricket, let alone follow it. And they only end their aversion to the game on one particular occasion \u2013 when India plays Pakistan. The reasons range from peer pressure to a heightened sense of patriotism and even adherence to social decorum. \u2018Cricket-crazy family leaves me no choice\u2019Vamini Sethi, management consultant, 33, GurgaonI will watch the game as my cricket-crazy family will leave me with no choice. It will be on TV all day and all the discussions in the house will be about the match. I don\u2019t follow cricket because I find it too time-consuming and overhyped. There are other sports like hockey, kabaddi that bring glory to our country but go unnoticed. I have nothing against the game; it brings the entire nation together. But it has so many fans, I\u2019m sure it can do with one less. \u2018Don\u2019t usually have time to watch cricket, but will make time today\u2019Ashvarya Sharma, homemaker, 52, DelhiIt\u2019s not that I hate cricket but since I am a homemaker, I have to keep running around doing chores and can\u2019t spend the whole day sitting and watching cricket. But TV pe bhi toh wahi chalta hai din bhar toh dekhna hi padta hai. However, the India-Pakistan game is different. I watch it by choice. It\u2019s not just cricket; it\u2019s almost war-like. The sentiment is different. In fact, today I plan to finish my chores early. Kitchen ki bhi chutti hai uss din. I don't miss a single ball of any India-Pakistan match. \u2018Will watch the match because it is the patriotic thing to do\u2019Ananya Pandey, communication professional, 29, DelhiI really never had anyone in my family who was an ardent cricket fan or watched it for fun, so I never found any company to watch the game or develop a taste for it. The last game I watched was the 2011 World Cup final that India won. I watched because it was a special occasion and it felt like the patriotic thing to do. Similarly, I will watch the India-Pakistan match today because it\u2019s a different rush altogether. As clich\u00e9d as it may sound, as an Indian, any Indo-Pak discussion catches my attention. Specially post the Pulwama attack and the increasing political tensions, I\u2019d like to see how this tension will affect the performances of both the teams. Also, on a lighter note, my boss \u2013 a die-hard cricket fan \u2013 has instructed me to watch this match and cheer for India. 'After balakot strike, anything India-Pak will attract me'Rajat Kothari, banker, 38, NoidaI don\u2019t follow cricket but an India-Pakistan game is not cricket. I don\u2019t understand the rules and the jargon of cricket and prefer football, to be honest. At least, it\u2019s played by more than a dozen countries in the world. But when I will sit with my friends and family to watch the game today, I won\u2019t be watching cricket, I feel I will be supporting India against Pakistan, on all fronts. After the skirmishes recently and the Balakot Air Strike, the atmosphere is such that anything India-Pakistan will attract my attention. This will be my first ever cricket match and I hope India wins. \u2018The only way to socialise today\u2019Ishita Mathur, teacher, 22, GhaziabadI will watch it because it\u2019s a great way to socialise. Today, cricket will be the only topic of conversation. It just doesn\u2019t seem right to ignore that or not be a part of the discourse. So, I will join my family in front of the TV today and watch the game. The reason I don\u2019t watch cricket is because I find it boring. I prefer other team sports like football and basketball. They seem more participative and active. In cricket, it seems only the bowler and batsmen are doing something at a given time while the others are passively involved. 'Flatmates will suck me into the frenzy'Tsering Tashi, research scholar, 29, DelhiI will have to watch it. What else do you do when everyone around you is crazy about it? I live in a flat with three other cricket-crazy boys and they will watch the game. So, I will be party to the frenzy. I grew up watching and playing football and for me, that is the beautiful game. Cricket is just a colonial hangover, not a sport. I have managed to avoid all the other India matches in the World Cup so far but the hype around the India-Pakistan match is such that you get sucked into the maelstrom somehow.

Workers at the site said the two private contractors overseeing the construction had forced them to get into the ditch despite the soil being loose. Angoori (24), a construction worker, took along her three-year-old child, Monika, with her into the ditch as there was no one to look after her. Angoori, her husband Guddu (25) and Monika were all trapped under the soil along with two other labourers \u2014 Babulal (35) and Bari (55). The cave-in took place at the construction site of a private building in Knowledge Park area around 11.45am. An excavator had just dug a ditch to lay the foundation for the building when the two contractors \u2014 Lalit and Kapil Bhadana \u2014 asked six of their workers to get inside the 6ft ditch and level the walls manually. As both Angoori and Guddu were ordered to get inside, they could not have left Monika alone. \u201cMinutes before the accident, an earthmover had dug up the area. After this, the contractors asked a bunch of workers to get inside the ditch and level the walls. This seemed risky, but the contractors forced the workers,\u201d said Rajkumar, Angoori\u2019s brother. He said the workers had told the two contractors that the soil was loose, but they refused to budge. \u201cThere was a pile of debris that needed to be excavated, but the contractor, without realising the odds, forced the workers inside the ditch. The walls collapsed within minutes and fell on the workers. The adults survived, but Monika succumbed to her injuries. My sister and brother-in-law, too, suffered injuries in the head and chest,\u201d Rajkumar added. The victims were rushed to Sharda Hospital, where the child was declared dead on arrival, while others were admitted for treatment of injuries. The two contractors have been booked under sections 304A (causing death by negligence) on a complaint by Rajkumar. \u201cThe contractors \u2014 Lalit and Kapil Bhadana \u2014 fled the spot soon after the accident. Prima facie, the construction workers were not given any helmets before they were sent inside the drain. A probe has been initiated, and due action will be taken against those found guilty,\u201d said Arvind Pathak, the station house officer of Knowledge Park police station.

The complainant and two of her friends said they were waiting for a client at the Lajpat Nagar Metro Station in Delhi on Tuesday night when two men in a Swift Dzire, an Ola cab, reached out to them around 11.30pm, police said quoting the complaint. \"A deal was struck between them at Rs 3,000 per client and the women were told that they would have to come to Noida Sector 18 and there would be two more men along with the duo. Rs 3,600 in advance was paid to them,\" Senior Superintendent of Police, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Vaibhav Krishna told reporters. Later, the women were instead taken to a farm house in sector 135 where seven more men arrived. But the women expressed their reluctance and told the men in the cab that they wanted to return to Delhi, the officer said. \"They were then raped by the men and later, on their plea, one of the accused agreed to drop them near the main road from where they contacted emergency police number 100 at 5 am and the matter came to light,\" Krishna said. Soon, officials from the Expressway Police Station reached out to the women and based on their complaint, a case under Indian Penal Code sections 376D (gangrape) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) was lodged, he said. \"The women also told police that they were thrashed by the men and the money that was paid to them as advance was forcibly taken back, while they were made no more payment,\" he added. Taking up investigation, police have arrested seven of the accused. They have been identified as Akhilesh Yadav, Lovlesh Yadav, Bhola Yadav, Anjan Yadav and Rajesh Yadav of Rae Bareli, Satish Pal of Hardoi and Rajkumar Maurya of Shahjahanpur, Krishna said. Two of the accused \u2013 Mulayam Singh of Rae Bareli, the cab driver, and Pankaj, alias Bouncer, of Barabanki \u2013 are still at large and efforts are underway to nab them, the district police chief added. One of the accused, Lovelesh Yadav, worked as a security guard at the farm house, which belongs to an officer in the Motor Transport Department in Delhi, according to police. \"The farm house has been sealed under CrPC section 102 (power of police officer to seize certain property),\" Krishna said.

According to the order, there are different committees on air pollution, water pollution, plastic management, waste disposal and management, plantation and others that need to be handled by a single authority and will be merged with this committee. The district magistrate will head the team that will include the heads of all related departments and the divisional forest officer will be the member secretary. \u201cAir pollution and waste management are some of the priority issues in Gautam Budh Nagar as we are part of NCR located close to Delhi. We will be meeting in the first week of every month and the chief secretary will chair every fourth meeting,\u201d said B N Singh, district magistrate. This step towards integration is expected to reduce delays in the implementation and improve coordination towards environmental conservation, he added. Uttar Pradesh has 15 cities with severely polluted air, nine critically and seriously polluted industrial clusters and riverbeds of 12 major rivers in the critically polluted category, according to the government order. This is according to the Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) scores developed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Other UP cities in the list include Ghaziabad, Baghpat, Hapur, Muzaffarnagar, Kanpur and Agra, among others. The new monitoring committee is expected to look into all land, air and water pollution related problems and maintain transparency. A web portal, UP Environmental Compliance Portal, will also be set up by the state pollution control board where all complaints and problems will regularly be updated and NGT orders will also be published. \u201cThere is insufficient infrastructure in the state for solid waste and e-waste management, also medical waste, plastic and C&D waste management is also not satisfactory. This is why it was important to have a monitoring authority in every district,\u201d states the government order. According to officials, the departments will fix an agenda that will be discussed, and its progress will be reviewed in the monthly meeting. A report will also be submitted by every district every three months. At the state level, monitoring will be done by four issue-specific committees \u2014 implementation committee, river rejuvenation committee, air quality monitoring committee and state level solid waste management monitoring committee. \u201cWe have already taken many steps for pollution management and improving green cover in the district. However, the efforts by various departments are disintegrated. With this new committee in place, we will be able to get all these efforts together and ensure that these are completed on time,\u201d Singh said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

An Indirapuram resident for the past seven years, the 38-year-old drives to Delhi, where his office is, every day. Yet last Friday, while returning from a late shift, he almost drove his car into a barricade on NH-9, a few hundred metres before the Noida Sector 62 crossing. It was dark and he saw the diversion late. There was no \u2018diversion ahead\u2019 warning. An Uber driver who does the Noida-Ghaziabad-Delhi circuit every day learnt the hard way that he could not trust his GPS on NH-9 like he does everywhere else. He likes the GPS because it gives him the shortest route. But recently, while taking passengers to Noida from Vaishali, the GPS pointed to an exit that brought him to a dead end. There was a mound of earth ahead. He said his passengers had warned him but he had insisted on following the map. Now, he just takes the advice because the highway is a maze. Changes are happening almost every day on NH-9, or Delhi-Meerut expressway, as the road gets widened and upgraded from UP Gate till the Dasna toll plaza and work picks up pace. The result is diversions, detours and closed turns, which are necessary because traffic cannot be stopped while the highway is being upgraded. But the complete absence of helping hands for traffic has drivers at a loss as to which way to turn. For instance, the original right turn into Noida from the highway, towards Labour Chowk, as one drives from Delhi is closed. A U-turn has been created a little further, but with no clear markers or personnel directing traffic, motorists have been left to figure it out on their own. It\u2019s the same for the new exits created on the Indirapuram side. The GPS can\u2019t keep pace with the changes, and unless one is familiar with the terrain, a motorist could easily miss an exit and end up taking a long detour, or worse, driving on the wrong side like many already do. This has led to the possibility of an accident shooting up. Regular commuters pointed out that when the Delhi portion of the highway \u2014 between Sarai Kale Khan and UP Gate \u2014 was being upgraded, similar diversions had to be made, but there were always a couple of traffic personnel posted at the diversions. This was very helpful, particularly at night, because traffic did not go stray. But as the construction machinery has moved into UP, the same standards are apparently not needed. Currently, between Kala Patthar in Indirapuram and Pratap Vihar, where the highway upgrade work is on in full swing, motorists have to negotiate about six diversions. The central verge is almost entirely dug up but not uniformly barricaded, so if motorists are not careful, they could slip into it. \u201cThe diversions are mostly marked with fluorescent strips, which during the daytime are useless and if you are not cautious enough, chances are there you might veer into the muddy track,\u201d said Abhishek Singh, a commuter. At night, there isn\u2019t enough light for these strips to glow, unless a strong headlight beam falls favourably on them. Mohan Mohanty, another commuter, points to another major problem caused by the lack of police oversight \u2014 autos and bikes diving between diversions and driving on the wrong side almost across the entire stretch, making driving difficult and often holding up traffic. \u201cAt Chajarsi cut, chances of a head-on collision are high,\u201d he says.

The residents maintained that since the cess is collected for welfare of labour, it should apply to only labour cost of the property purchased or constructed and not the construction cost of the property.

Noida Authority has decided to undertake a pilot project for four months in which an artificial intelligence-based Integrated Traffic Management System will be launched. But traffic experts pointed out that several sections of the district, including two expressways, were already under CCTV coverage and the need of the hour was to fix road designs to ensure smooth flow of traffic. Referring to the intersections at sectors 57, 31/25, Noida-Greater Noida Expressway and Yamuna Expressway, the experts said many cameras could not capture violations due to different fonts and sizes of numbers on the plates. \u201cAt present, cameras at different intersections can capture only those violators whose number plates are easily visible. At the crossings, the problem is that only those offenders at the forefront can be captured. At these points, vehicles that jump signals stand bumper to bumper and their number plates cannot be read at all,\u201d said Anurag Kulshreshtha, president of TRAX, a society that works for road safety issues. Kulshreshtha also called for an awareness drive to instill road discipline in people. This, he said, can be done only if there are enough cops at the junctions and challans are issued to violators within days.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The committee, which recently surveyed Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Nodia, has dubbed the Hindon a \u201cdead river\u201d that has a dissolved oxygen level of almost zero. The team also visited 23 industries and government hospitals in Ghaziabad and noted that hardly any of them were adhering to environmental norms. In its report, the committee has said that \u201cup to 35-40% patients coming to these medical colleges and hospitals may be infected and they are prone to suffer from variety of diseases like cancer, asthma, collitis and other alike water and air-borne diseases\u201d. On pollution in the Hindon, the committee has said that government agencies have turned a blind eye on illegal colonies that have mushroomed around waterbodies. \u201cWe have issued directives to the administration of these three districts to initiate a demolition drive in the river catchment area,\u201d said Rajendera Singh, general secretary of the NGT committee. In Ghaziabad, the committee found that eight major drains \u2014 Jwala drain, Arthala drain, Kaila Bhatta drain, Indirapuram drain, Dasna drain, Pratap Vihar drain, Karheda drain and Hindon Vihar drain \u2014 were discharging untreated sewage in the Hindon. \u201cNo STP/ETP has been connected to treat the entire sewage, in consequence thereof, the entire city of Ghaziabad is polluting river Hindon with untreated sewage,\u201d the report said. The team also noted that industries were not adhering to environmental norms. \u201cOf the 20-plus industries we inspected, except for Honda industry, no other industry meets the environmental norms. Even those industries that have installed STP/ETP often bypass their effluents and discharge it directly into drains, which ultimately find their way into the Hindon river,\u201d said Singh, who added that a detailed report on the committee\u2019s findings is being prepared and will be released shortly. City-based environmentalist Sushil Raghav said that in July last year, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had carried out a survey to ascertain the level of groundwater and surface water contamination around the Hindon. \u201cGroundwater samples were analysed for parameters such as fluoride, sulphate, oil and grease and heavy metals. The report revealed that 93 of 168 groundwater sampling locations in Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur and Shamli are contaminated with one or more parameters and exceeded BIS drinking water specifications,\u201d said Raghav. \u201cWhat the committee is saying is nothing new, but despite such damning report and observations, no one is really interested in the river,\u201d he added. Hindon, also known as Harnadi, is a rain-fed river that originates from Saharanpur and flows through Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Baghpat and Ghaziabad before emptying into the Yamuna. Due to the high levels of pollution, Hindon has earned the status of \u201cdead river\u201d and its water declared \u201cunfit\u201d even for bathing.

The Aranya project was probably the first housing project in India to be deregistered under the new real estate law and taken over for completion by the regulatory authority in May. The project, which began in 2007, is valued over Rs 1,500 crore, and the total number of investors is around 1,400. According to UP-Rera member Balwinder Kumar, the step will help the regulatory authority to know exactly how many genuine buyers are invested in the project, so that a correct estimate can be drawn of the amount of money paid up to the builder and how much the investors still owe towards the completion of their flats. \u201cDuring preliminary investigation, we found multiple allocation of single flats. We have also found multiple flats \u2014 10 or 15 in a bunch booked under a single name. So obviously we are finding it difficult to get a true picture of the list of buyers. But a fresh registration of all buyers of the project would help us identify them,\u201d Kumar told TOI. Moreover, the regulator is in the process of getting a co-builder on board for the completion of the pending flats. \u201cWe have also asked a builder, chosen by the buyers to present their completion plan to UP-Rera on Wednesday. If we are not convinced, we may ask Noida Authority to select a builder for the same,\u201d he added. The UP-Rera had earlier asked the state government to constitute a special investigation team to look into the alleged misappropriation of Rs 147 crore by Unnati. The figure came to fore after a forensic audit by Curry & Brown. Moreover, an inspection team of Noida Authority earlier found that out of eight towers, only four are ready for completion and in four towers, major construction work is still pending. While Aranya phases 1 and 2 apartment buyers have completely paid up their money and the phases 3, 4 and 5 buyers have so far only paid up about 20% of the cost to the builder. UP-Rera officers earlier confirmed that the builder had left the country. The completion of the project has been initiated by UP-Rera by invoking Section 7 of the Rera Act, which makes provision for UP-Rera to step in and facilitate completion of abandoned projects.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

Anita Khanna, whose husband had died a few years ago, was living alone without her family, police said. She was a heart patient. Khanna is suspected to have expired nearly three days ago, but her body was found only when an employee working with a meter reading company informed police that the house was emitting foul smell. Amit Kumar, Sector 37 chowki in-charge said that a police response vehicle was sent to the spot around 11am on Monday. \u201cHer elder son is working in Dubai as a trader while her younger son is working in Bengaluru. Her daughter-in-law, who stays with her parents in Sector 29, was informed about the incident. Her elder son later came from Dubai. They refused to get a post-mortem done,\u201d Kumar said. In the same sector, retired major general Sher Singh Rathore, also 84, died at his home late Tuesday night. His body was retrieved on Wednesday morning. Rathore, who was suffering from high blood pressure and high sugar levels, told his attendant Ankit on Tuesday night that he felt uneasy. When Ankit checked his room later, he found that Rathore was not moving and informed police, said Sector 39 SHO Rajesh Sharma. Rathore is survived by three daughters, all based in the United States. While police said that Ankit was a full-time attendant, neighbours said he used to work part-time.

The two were suspected to have committed suicide due to financial woes.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step.

In his complaint, Prasad had also accused Kavita\u2019s mother-in-law of torture but the charges against her were abetted after she died a natural death on October 10, 2016. The government counsel said the defence lawyer failed to produce any evidence to counter the allegations against his clients. \u201cThey failed to produce any solid proof other than a few witnesses who denied the dowry part to counter the allegations. The defence lawyer, in his argument, said the deceased woman had been suffering from tuberculosis, and committed suicide due to depression,\u201d said the lawyer.
