Is it not the failure of the state government?

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

The 65 villages are divided into five provinces, and these are subdivided into 11 smaller portions call \u2018Karai\u2019, each administered by two leaders known as \u2018Ambalathukarar\u2019. There are 22 Ambalathukarars who administer and manage the three major temples in the region. All 65 villages are dominated by the Kallar community for whom appointment as Ambalathukarar is a matter of prestige. Recently, a person from the community demanded that he be instated as an Ambalathukarar which was opposed by many. He approached the civil court which dismissed his petition. The HR & CE department was then informed about largescale misappropriation of funds belonging to the temples. A petition urged the department to take administrative control of the shrines. On coming to know of this, the villagers decided to take out a protest march to the department in Madurai. However, the assistant commissioner of HR and CE, Vijayan, tahsildar Sivagaminathan and Melur DSP Subash and other officials held talks with the villagers and asked them to give their objections to the takeover of their temples. ``We were assured that nothing would be done against our wishes,\u2019\u2019 said S Kurinji Kumaran, the Ambalathukarar of Samattikarai, who has been leading this collective of villages for over 12 years now. He said that someone had told the HR & CE department that they were handling a lot of funds regarding the temples and sought the department\u2019s intervention. ``The Vellalur Nadu collective has been in existence for the past 500 years and about 2 lakh people from the 65 villages offer worship here, and the deities are considered their traditional deities,\u2019\u2019 he said. Earlier, there had been a similar allegation of the temples receiving crores of rupees as hundi collection, which was brought to the department\u2019s notice. Consequently, the village heads decided to do away with hundi collection in these temples over a decade ago. The annual festival of the temples is celebrated in a grand way, including the one for the Ezhaikatha Amman temple, where seven small girls are made to represent the female deity. They are made to stay in the temple and rituals conducted for a week. ``Our temples are administered exclusively on the donations from villagers, who are attached to these temples and no outside donations are accepted,\u2019\u2019 said Kumaran. He added that all the heads and the village representatives come together to decide on the annual expenditure of the temple festival, and it is split among the five provinces.  People in each province contribute to the festival. Donations are also collected in the form of rice to feed the people who come to the festival and for the workers. Over 20,000 people, most them women, gathered in the village protesting the proposed move to take over the temple. Shops in Vellalur Nadu remained closed on Wednesday morning in protest. They said that the ownership of the temple should be theirs and that they would not bequeath it to outsiders.

Speaking to reporters in Madurai on Tuesday, he said that the policy aims at increasing the gross education ratio (GER) of the country by 50 %, by 2032 in ways that could affect the entire system. So far, autonomous institutions have enjoyed only the academic autonomy without the financial or administrative power. But the new education policy paved the way for financial and administrative autonomy. This meant that the institutions were free to appoint people of their choice and fix own fees which would make it impossible for poor students to have access to it.  \u201cIn short, the Centre is shrugging off its responsibility in higher education,\u2019\u2019 he said. Mission Nalanda and Mission Takshashila would only lead to saffronisation of the education. It is regressive and similar to a system that existed almost 1,400 years ago, he said. The institutes would be categorised into three and the first two can provide learning through the open university mode and distance education mode, and there would be no norms to control them in terms of basic amenities. It says colleges can authorise degrees, which could result in the standard of education going down like that in Bihar.The proposals of National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) for Arts and Science Courses would keep it beyond the reach of poor students. The National Education Commission, Rashtriya Shiksha Aayog, can give the Prime Minister the permission to take decisions that could disrupt the entire education system, he said. The draft of the policy has been given only in English, and June 30 is designated as the last date for submissions of suggestions. \u201cThis is too short and it should be extended by six months,\u201d he said.

The theft came to light when a woman staff member in the pharmacy took stock of the collection of the day on Sunday night. She noticed a shortage of Rs 8,300 and reported it to the hospital management. Going through the CCTV footage recorded in the pharmacy, hospital authorities saw two youths stealing money from the cash box. The youths were seen asking for some medicines.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing. Living with the dead: A grave in the backyard\"All we are asking for is some land for our ancestors. There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar. Their burial grounds are filled to capacity,\" said Nizam Khan, a mechanic. Village pradhan Sundar Kumar said that he had asked officials several times for a burial ground for Muslim families, but no action was taken. Ravi Kumar NG, the district magistrate, said that he was not aware of the issue. \"I will send an official team to the village and get details of the burial land required.\" Picture Credit: Hemant Kumar In Video:Houses turn into graveyards as Muslims in this UP village bury the dead at homeDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Satta Market": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-assembly-polls-satta-market-bets-shift-from-winner-loser-to-seat-tally/articleshow/66726353.cms", "description": "BHOPAL: This assembly  is turning out to be a nail-biter. The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

President of the chamber, N Jegatheesan said that the number of international passengers in Madurai is higher than Coimbatore even though it had only three international services. The Coimbatore airport was already included in the Bilateral Air Services Agreement (BASA) with several other countries. International air traffic from Vijayawada airport during the same period was only 2,102, and no one departed from Tirupathi airport. However, while the central government declared Vijayawada and Tirupathi as international airports, Madurai remained a customs airport. Madurai, the second largest city in the state, is the gateway for thirteen south and central districts including Dindigul, Theni, Virudhunagar, Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari. These districts had a total population of 2,32,93,738, which is 29% of the state\u2019s population. Every year, approximately 1.2 lakh passengers travel from Madurai and the other southern districts to Malaysia, 94,000 to Singapore, 80,000 to UAE, 68,000 to Saudi Arabia and 75,000 to Oman. Lack of direct air connectivity to many of the international destinations has been restricting the tourism development, exports and economic growth of the region. Only declaring Madurai as an international airport will help its industrial growth, he said. As of now Madurai has direct flights only to Dubai, Sri Lanka and Singapore, being operated by domestic airliners. Since Madurai is a point of call airport with Sri Lanka, Sri Lankan Airways has been operating a direct flight service between Colombo and Madurai for long. Non\u2013inclusion of Madurai airport as point of call with other international destinations has been restraining foreign airliners such as Air Asia, Singapore Airlines, Tiger Airways, Air Arabia etc. from operating direct services to Madurai. All these airlines have applied to the central aviation ministry for permission to operate flights to Madurai. He has said that the TNCCI hoped that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take steps to declare Madurai as a 24x7 airport to enhance the industrial, economic and tourism growth in the region.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

The petitioner, P Udhayakumar, a physically challenged man, stated that after passing Class X, he had registered his name at the district employment office in Theni district during 1998. He said that though he has been waiting for the job for the past 13 years, P Sekar, who was junior-most in seniority, was appointed to the post of night watchman at the Kamayakoundanpatti panchayat union in 2011 as he was the relative of the executive officer. Hence, he moved the HC seeking to quash the appointment and appoint him as the night watchman. Justice S M Subramaniam observed that in view of the legal significance of the appointment of candidates to Group IV services, the court was inclined to suo motu implead the chief secretary of the state as a respondent for the purpose of implementing the order uniformly. The court said it is not inclined to quash the appointment of Sekar since he has been continuing in service for more than eight years and there is no sufficient evidence to quash the process of selection. However, the judge said there is concrete doubt in the mind of the court that such kind of appointments is made without following the established procedures. The judge said that postings to Group IV services and last grade services are made on favouritism and nepotism and that there are largescale allegations in respect of such appointments. He said that transparency is an elementary principle in improving the system of selection and appointment to public posts as it will minimise the possibility of favouritism and corrupt activities. \u201cThe district collectors are playing a pivotal role as they are the authority competent in their respective districts and therefore, they are dutybound to ensure that such appointments to Group IV services and last grade services are made with some sense of constitutionality,\u201d the judge observed.

The protest, which started at around 10.30am, ended only at 6pm. Due to this traffic on the Panagal Road connecting Goripalayam and Sivaganga Road had to be diverted through another route. The protesters demanded the arrest of all those involved in the attack, stringent action and compensation for the victim\u2019s family. Three more people, who sustained injuries in the attack are undergoing treatment. A few community leaders including former MLA of Usilampatti P V Kathiravan took part in the protest.

Later, collector (in-charge) S Shantha Kumar held talks with the protesters, but they did not relent. Again, a meeting was held at his chamber in the district collectorate. The protest was finally withdrawn after assurance that all the suspects will be arrested and a solatium of Rs 2 lakh would be given. The protesters also received the body and took it to their native village, where the final rites were carried out. It maybe recalled that four people from an intermediate caste were attacked by a gang belonging to the scheduled caste community in Kodukkampatti on Sunday afternoon. Rambu and his friends, hailing from Nathapatti, Kachirayanpatti and Kodukkampatti were cruising through a street on a bike when a group of youths from the scheduled caste community stopped the vehicle. A quarrel broke out when they snatched the keys and questioned them. As the arguments turned murkier, the gang consisting of about 15 people attacked the four using wooden logs and stones. Rambu died in hospital the next day. Police officials said that the Keelavalavu police have registered a murder case and arrested 14 people so far. A posse of police personnel have been deployed at vulnerable pockets in the villages around Melur to prevent further tension.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

President of the chamber, N Jegatheesan said that the number of international passengers in Madurai is higher than Coimbatore even though it had only three international services. The Coimbatore airport was already included in the Bilateral Air Services Agreement (BASA) with several other countries. International air traffic from Vijayawada airport during the same period was only 2,102, and no one departed from Tirupathi airport. However, while the central government declared Vijayawada and Tirupathi as international airports, Madurai remained a customs airport. Madurai, the second largest city in the state, is the gateway for thirteen south and central districts including Dindigul, Theni, Virudhunagar, Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari. These districts had a total population of 2,32,93,738, which is 29% of the state\u2019s population. Every year, approximately 1.2 lakh passengers travel from Madurai and the other southern districts to Malaysia, 94,000 to Singapore, 80,000 to UAE, 68,000 to Saudi Arabia and 75,000 to Oman. Lack of direct air connectivity to many of the international destinations has been restricting the tourism development, exports and economic growth of the region. Only declaring Madurai as an international airport will help its industrial growth, he said. As of now Madurai has direct flights only to Dubai, Sri Lanka and Singapore, being operated by domestic airliners. Since Madurai is a point of call airport with Sri Lanka, Sri Lankan Airways has been operating a direct flight service between Colombo and Madurai for long. Non\u2013inclusion of Madurai airport as point of call with other international destinations has been restraining foreign airliners such as Air Asia, Singapore Airlines, Tiger Airways, Air Arabia etc. from operating direct services to Madurai. All these airlines have applied to the central aviation ministry for permission to operate flights to Madurai. He has said that the TNCCI hoped that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take steps to declare Madurai as a 24x7 airport to enhance the industrial, economic and tourism growth in the region.

Police said that though the idols were made up of panchaloha (alloy of five metals), the composition of the valuable metals like gold and silver were of minimum quantity and hence the worth of the idols was less than Rs 2 lakh. The theft took place at Kariamanikka Perumal temple located in Idaikattur village situated 10 km away from Manamadurai. An FIR was registered with the Manamadurai police station. The idols were donated 15 years ago. Perumal idol was measuring up to two and half feet and weighing around 50 to 60 kg, Sridevi and Boodevi idols measuring around one and half feet high were weighing around 20 kg each. Police officers said that local thieves might have stolen the idols for its metal value. Since they were not antique pieces, they cannot be sold in their original shape. Teams have been formed to trace the thieves. The police suspect local hands in the crime. Deputy superintendent of police, Manamadurai range, G Karthikeyan said since it was village temple, there was no security in place. The only protection the idols had was a steel gate. The thieves entered the sanctum sanctorum after breaking open a padlock. They should have escaped through the backside of the temple, where a river is located.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

She noted that when she submitted a representation and approached the officials she leant that the pension was stopped as the officials received information that she was dead.Sundarammal said that it is the duty of the officials to verify the information and added that she had sent a representation in 2016 seeking to furnish her death certificate based on which her OAP was stopped. The deputy tahsildar of Kamuthi taluk though a communication dated April 15, 2016 asked her to give another representation seeking OAP. She said that though she has submitted several representations to the officials concerned, no steps were taken to distribute OAP. Hence, she approached the high court. When the petition was heard on Wednesday, justice R Suresh Kumar observed that though the petitioner was very much alive, she came to know that somebody have given false information that she was dead based on which the revenue authorities have stopped the OAP. Hence, a report by way of an affidavit or counter was sought as to what went wrong in this case on July 3.

B Pandiarajan, has extensively worked for the dalit rights and children education, in the capacity as a member of district vigilance committee, and is a full-time social activist. The new five-member CWC was constituted last year after a selection process, which started in 2015.

Recently, an official from the social defence department had informed that Pandiarajan was not selected for the committee since he was part of a couple of committees. Pandiarajan stated that they were only honorary membership and require only a few sittings in a year. \u201cWhen a government teacher with a full-time job was appointed, why not full time social worker?,\u201d he questioned. He stated that section 18 (2) of the juvenile justice act says that the vacancy of a member can be filled from the panel of names in the order of preference as recommended earlier by the selection committee.

The injured were identified as P Subash, 19, and P Thangaiah, 30, from Kodukkampatti, R Dhivakar, 19, from Kachirayanpatti. While the deceased and injured belong to an intermediate caste, the attackers hailed from a scheduled caste community. Police sources said that both the accused and the injured were under the influence of alcohol. The attack took place on Sunday afternoon at Kodukkampatti due to a sudden provocation between the two groups. Rambu and his friends visited Kodukkampatti village, where his relatives reside, to attend a temple festival. They went to a shop located in the scheduled caste people\u2019s residential area. As they sped through the locality on a two-wheeler, a group of people from the scheduled caste community warned them against rash riding in their area. This resulted in a heated argument. A group of around 15 people the attacked the four using wooden logs and stones, which left them badly injured. Rambu, who suffered grievous injuries, was first taken to a hospital in Singampunari, from where he was referred to the Government Rajaji Hospital, where he died on Monday.

The exercise is being carried out to ensure that students who discontinue studies without much thought are brought back, by talking to their parents. Since mostly teenagers and youths involve in criminal activities in Madurai city, the police believe that such a survey and counselling can prevent them from joining hands with anti-social elements. The dropouts are lured by gangs into engaging in minor offences before they go on to become hardened criminals. Youngsters\u2019 involvement in crime activities has been a cause of concern for the city police. First-time offenders mostly involve in crimes like snatching, which has been a big challenge for the city police. City police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham told TOI that the list of dropouts is expected to be made available in a month. Dropouts from classes VIII to XII as well as those from colleges also will be targeted. \u201cWe will check what the dropouts do now and efforts will be taken to put them back in schools and colleges. We will talk to their parents to make sure they continue their education,\u201d he said. Police officers from the city police unit say that minors involve in all sorts of crime starting from theft, robbery and chain snatching to murder. The youths, who are aimless in life, gang up and start committing minor offences before becoming notorious elements. \u201cSuch youths are supplied addictive stuff such as liquor and ganja. Once they become loyal, they are used to observe movements of their targets. After their involvement in a few crimes, they go for ghastly acts such as murder. Many also get murdered in the rivalry between gangs,\u201d said a police officer. After getting caught and landing in prison, they require money towards legal expenses to come out of the prison. When they come out they cannot get employed and are forced to commit another offence to find money to pay for the legal expense. Over time, this has become a vicious cycle. Hence it is important to wean them out of the criminal activities, another officer said. He added that \u201cit is the duty of the parents to closely monitor the behavioural changes in their wards. With both parents working to keep the family afloat, they would not be effectively monitoring their children. \u201cMost of the parents wake up only after a point where it is difficult to wean them out,\u201d an officer said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

A state transport corporation (TNSTC) official said that the sudden surge was down to the India-Pakistan match that ended shortly before midnight as many waited for the match to end to start off their journey. \u201cThere was a sudden rush after the India\u2013Pakistan World Cup match ended shortly before midnight. We tried our best to manage by operating additional buses,\u201d said a TNSTC official in response to the heavy rush at the Arapalayam bus stand. Return of a large number of college students from the southern districts to colleges in the Coimbatore and Salem regions for the reopening of academic year added to the situation. Besides, who were lucky to get consecutive auspicious days for weddings, were going back to wort on the day. Passengers swarmed the bus stand and the approach roads in the hope of catching a government bus. To the dismay of passengers, there were not enough government buses for Coimbatore. \u201cThe number of government buses early on Monday was way lesser than on other days,\u201d said passenger Premila,. The woman, who was heading for Coimbatore with two children, said that there was only one government bus to Tirupur around 1 am and no buses to Coimbatore at that time. \u201cThe bus to Tirupur was overcrowded and we could not get into it with the children and luggage,\u201d said the woman. Due to the rush, many omni buses (long distance private buses) did not enter the city on Sunday night and in the early hours of Monday. These buses used to charge Rs 250 for a semi-sleeper and Rs 350 for an AC sleeper berth to Coimbatore. On Sunday, passengers without any other option had to pay Rs 400 for a seater in an ordinary private bus to Coimbatore. There were at least 10 such private buses waiting at that time. \u201cWe have to return without passengers. Hence, we are charging Rs 400,\u201d said one of the operators. This left passengers lamenting, as they paid Rs 1,600 for a family of four as operators charged this fare for adults and children alike. \u201cIf there were enough TNSTC buses, we would have paid just Rs 510 at Rs 170 each for me and my wife and half the fare for the two children,\u201d lamented a passenger. A TNSTC official in Madurai told ToI that they operated 26 additional buses to Coimbatore, 12, Tirupur, 11, and Salem, 3, on Sunday night and that this was in addition to additional buses operated by the Coimbatore, 20, and the Salem divisions of TNSTC. Madurai division also operated around 20 additional buses Madurai and Virudhunagar to Chennai due to the heavy rush, he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The Congress leader hit out at BJP's strategy of playing the nationalist card. \"We are Congress\u2026 we launched the freedom movement\u2026 gave our blood and sweat\u2026 braved British atrocities \u2026 we don't need any certificate to prove our nationalist feelings especially from the ones who apologised to the British at that time\", asserted Priyanka, urging the workers to go to every household in their area and meet every voter. She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022. And once we come, we will stay here for long on the basis of our hard work,\" she said adding that the hard-workers would be adequately rewarded.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Saif Ali Khan": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/world-cup-pakistani-man-tries-to-misbehave-with-saif-ali-khan-fans-back-on-social-media/videoshow/69859837.cms", "description": ""}, "ENCROACHMENT": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/encroachment/articleshow/64820469.cms", "description": ""}, "Sundaram Park in Madurai needs to be maintained": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/sundaramparkinmaduraineedstobemaintained/articleshow/65713207.cms", "description": ""}, "Dumpage of Garbage in Water channel": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/dumpageofgarbageinwaterchannel/articleshow/64442345.cms", "description": ""}}
