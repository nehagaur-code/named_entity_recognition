During the inspection, the deputy commissioner couldn\u2019t find the stock register as it was not available in the store. Shankar, who lost his cool, ordered immediate suspension of the pharmacist and the drug warehouse manager. When Shankar found the hospital superintendent missing and was told he had gone to the zilla panchayat office to attend a meeting, he cross-checked with panchayat officials only to be told there was no such meeting.

This follows a recent assessment by the Kannada Development Authority (KDA) about the use of the state's official language in the company's marketing strategy. It led the company to print the brand and product names in Kannada on its products.  KSDL managing director MR Ravi Kumar said, \"Kannada and the local state language are used in marketing all our products. For example, if our products are sold in Andhra Pradesh, the words will be in Telugu and Kannada. When sold in Hindi-speaking areas, they'll be in Hindi and Kannada.\"  For products sold globally, KSDL will use English as the primary language along with the local language of that nation. \"Introducing Kannada for the export market has not yet been considered,\" said Kumar.  Also, the 103-year-old company will use photographs of Mysore Sandal Soap creators - Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar and his diwan Sir M Visvesvaraya - on all products sold worldwide. Board\u2019s nod awaitedThe state government has given its concurrence for using their photographs and the KSDL board\u2019s approval is awaited. The idea to promote the founders came after a spike in demand for its sandal incense sticks. \u201cWe initially mooted branding of our sandal incense sticks as \u2018MV 100 sticks\u2019 in recognition of Sir M Visvesvaraya\u2019s contribution. Soon after the meeting with KDA a few months ago, we decided to acknowledge Wadiyar\u2019s contribution in starting the company,\u201d said Kumar. The company\u2019s turnover in 2018-19 is Rs 700 crore with a net profit of Rs 110 crore, while 2019-20, the turnover is estimated to rise to Rs 900 crore with a net profit of Rs 150 crore.

The incident, which occurred in Rajarajeshwarinagar, has sent shockwaves across the locality. \"Had the driver or the van\u2019s attendant been more cautious, the boy would have lived. Sheer negligence on their part resulted in his death,\" said police. The victim, Chintan Ramesh Magadum, was a class 1 student of Swarangini School and PU College in BEML Layout. Chintan\u2019s father Ramesh Magadum works in a private company, while his mother Madhuri is a teacher. Ramesh and Madhuri had ensured that Chintan is dropped at the daycare centre in the school bus after classes. In fact, the attendant would escort Chintan to the centre on the other side of the road. Later, the couple would pick him up from the centre. The same routine unfolded on Monday, when the school van driven by Suresh stopped near the daycare centre at 3pm. However, the woman attendant reportedly did not pay attention to Chintan. She allegedly allowed the boy to cross the road on his own and returned to the bus. The driver, on seeing the attendant get into the vehicle, assumed Chintan had entered the daycare centre and pressed the accelerator. \"We have seized the bus and arrested the driver. He said he hadn\u2019t seen Chintan in front of the vehicle and this led to the accident,\" a police officer said. Following the incident, senior police officers suggested school managements take precautions and school van drivers and attendants take care of children\u2019s safety. \"We create awareness about road safety in schools and the measures that should be adopted by all to avoid accidents. There are students\u2019 association for road safety (SARS) in all 42 traffic police stations in Bengaluru and they are led by police constables. They visit schools in their jurisdiction during prayer time and provide lessons on road safety,\" a senior traffic police officer explained. \"Every year, we conduct workshops for school bus drivers to teach them about road safety. Schools have opened after summer vacation and we will soon begin conducting the workshops,\" said Sowmyalatha SK, deputy commissioner of police (traffic west).

FUO is a condition where a person\u2019s down with fever (101\u00b0 F) for over 2-3 weeks and investigations fail to determine its cause. While there were 1,57,881 FUO cases in 2017, the number stood at 1,42,890 in 2018 and 50,062 till May 2019. According to the ongoing study conducted by the the BBMP\u2019s Public Health Information and Epidemiological Cell (PHIEC), FUO has emerged as the most common reason for hospital visits by Bengalureans under the \u2018communicable diseases\u2019 category. The data was collated from 450 private and government hospitals in the city, including independent labs and diagnostic centres, BBMP\u2019s 85 primary health centres and 30 maternity hospitals. The exercise was taken up under the National Urban Health Mission to enable policymakers to design preventive strategies. However, hardly any efforts are being made to analyse FUO. Senior doctors working with PHIEC admitted the team hasn\u2019t done much to decipher the FUO data. \u201cWe are focusing more on preventing common communicable diseases like typhoid, cholera, dengue and gastroenteritis. If tests for typhoid, dengue, malaria and Hepatitis are negative, hospitals report them as FUO cases,\u201d said BBMP officials. The data has come as a shocker for the medical community. Those with self-limiting fever hardly come back for follow-up visits and can\u2019t be categorised as FUO patients, said Dr Ambanna Gowda, consultant, internal medicine specialist, Fortis Hospitals. \u201cOn the first day of fever, we don\u2019t advise a battery of tests. If the patient doesn\u2019t return, it can\u2019t be called FUO. If the same person visits another hospital, we wouldn\u2019t know. The data may not be completely accurate,\u201d said Dr Gowda. He recalled the case of 10-year-old boy from Odisha who\u2019s being treated for FUO. Formation of lymph nodes in the chest has now emerged as the cause. FUO is usually a symptom of tuberculosis, malignancy or abscess (puss formation in body tissue), which are diagnosed only after several tests, he pointed out. However, the BBMP ruled out duplication in data furnished by city hospitals. \u201cA patient\u2019s name and address can\u2019t appear more than once in BBMP\u2019s PHIEC data pool if he or she goes to another hospital with the same complaint. The address is captured using GIS-based reporting and hence, there\u2019s no room for repeat entries,\u201d civic officials explained. Loopholes in data reporting?According to Dr SM Prasad, vice president, Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Bengaluru chapter, to consider a case as that of FUO, a patient\u2019s fever must be watched and documented for at least seven days. \u201cIf it persists for the duration and tests don\u2019t reveal any cause, only then can it be called FUO. There could be loopholes in reporting of data. FUO could be an uncommon manifestation of a common illness, like fever seen in a child with skin allergy or puss formation. It could also be a common manifestation of an uncommon illness like meningitis (inflammation of brain, spinal cord),\u201d he opined. The expert ruled out the possibility of lakhs of such cases being seen regularly in OPDs. Doctors also said since the BBMP data doesn\u2019t reflect the duration of FUO, it\u2019s not sufficient to draw any conclusions. \u201cUsually in fever cases that are self-limiting viral infections, we don\u2019t look for the cause. If a child has fever but is stable, no investigation is done if it subsides. There\u2019s a possibility of such cases being reported as those of FUO. The data doesn\u2019t make much sense,\u201d said Dr SG Kasi, a paediatrician.

Sugar minister RB Thimmapur, in Belagavi on Tuesday, virtually confirmed the move, saying: \u201cWe are ready to resign in December if the high command asks us to do so.\u201d Thimmapur suggested the two independents \u2014 H Nagesh and R Shankar \u2014 were inducted into the cabinet to save the government from falling. Vishwanath to continue?Meanwhile, AH Vishwanath is likely to withdraw his resignation from the post of JD(S) state president, following a request from party surpemo HD Deve Gowda. During a luncheon meeting at the former Prime Minister\u2019s residence on Tuesday, Gowda reportedly prevailed on Vishwanath to continue as president, while categorically turning down his request to be relieved of the responsibility. Vishwanath had tendered his resignation two weeks ago, citing ill-health, while also owning responsibility for the party\u2019s poor show in the recent Lok Sabha elections. Gowda is believed to have requested Vishwanath to continue as president for some more time, saying the party is in a \"poor state\" and he needed a leader of Vishwanath\u2019s calibre and commitment to rebuild it. Vishwanath reportedly remained non-committal to Gowda's request and has asked for a few days' time to make a decision. It is learnt Vishwanath is also in a dilemma, but is likely to heed Gowda's request as he is indebted to the former Prime Minister for giving him political rebirth after he was sidelined in the Congress. When contacted, Vishwanath said his poor health does not permit him to do justice to the post. \"I will take a decision soon,\" Vishwanath said. Tourism minister SR Mahesh, with whom Vishwanath is peeved for refusing to extend tickets to his supporters in the KR Nagar local body election, was also present at the meeting.

In fact, when the revenue department questioned him last December on whether IMA had obtained permission from the RBI and Sebi, the IMA founder-owner replied: \u201cWe do not deal with financial instruments. We deal with metals such as gold, silver, copper, nickel and precious stones. Hence, the need does not arise to obtain any permission from RBI or Sebi.\u201d TOI has accessed a copy of the reply Khan sent to the authorities on December 14 when his firm\u2019s transactions raised the suspicions of revenue officials and they made moves to attach IMA\u2019s properties. Maintaining his stand that IMA had never collected deposits from the public, leaving police with no jurisdiction to take action against him, Khan said his mode of business was a limited liability partnership (LLP) governed under the LLP Act, 2008, under the purview of the registrar of companies (RoC) of the Union ministry of corporate affairs. \u201cFrom the outset, Khan tried to mislead state authorities by citing the RoC,\u201d said BC Thiruvengadam, a company lawyer who has dealt with similar cases. \u201cBut the fact of the matter was that the bullion business he was taking about is under the ambit of commodities market regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC), which the government merged with Sebi in 2015. So Khan could not have run his business without permission from Sebi.\u201d On Khan\u2019s claim that his company had never dealt with financial instruments, Thiruvengadam said while LLPs attract company laws, Sebi and the RBI could, in coordination with the state government, have moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and attached IMA\u2019s properties. \u201cThe authorities took a similar step in the Satyam case before they attached Ramalinga Raju\u2019s properties,\u201d Thiruvengadam said. But Khan may have inadvertently been helped by the state government\u2019s withdrawal of the assistant commissioner\u2019s powers to attach properties after he replied to its notice. \u201cThe powers were withdrawn for a technical reasons, but that move helped Khan get off the hook,\u201d said assistant commissioner, revenue, LC Nagaraj. After the scam broke out, however, chief secretary TM Vijayabhaskar convened a meeting of senior officials at which it was decided to restore the assistant commissioner\u2019s powers to attach properties in such cases.

Asserting that his comments against state Congress leaders were the opinion of the party workers, he said he was in the Indian National Congress headed by Rahul Gandhi and \"not in the Siddu (Siddaramaiah) Congress\". \"Last night, I got the information that I have been suspended from the party...Is it a crime to speak the truth? What I have said is the truth,\" Baig said. Speaking to reporters here, he said he had not criticised Gandhi and that he continued to be a \"disciplined soldier of the party\". \"My criticism of state leaders is true. Is speaking the truth a crime? They have taken action against me. There are some senior leaders and friends in the party like Ramalinga Reddy, H K Patil, Mallikarjun Kharge and K H Muniyappa. I will meet them and discuss with the party workers on whether to go to Delhi and speak there,\" he added. The Congress suspended Baig, a rebel MLA, on Tuesday night with immediate effect, citing his \"anti-party\" activities. Hitting out at Karnataka Congress leaders for the party's dismal show in the Lok Sabha polls, Baig had recently held Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah's \"arrogance\" and KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao's \"immaturity\" responsible for the \"flop show\". He had also called Congress general secretary K C Venugopal a \"buffoon\". Baig had dropped hints of quitting the party and appealed to Muslims to \"compromise\" with the situation on the BJP-led NDA returning to power at the Centre. The Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) had issued a show-cause notice to the MLA for his conduct, to which he had not responded. Noting that Gandhi had offered to resign as the All India Congress Committee (AICC) president, taking responsibility for the poll defeat, Baig said, \"When we criticise here in the state for the party winning only one seat in the Lok Sabha polls, action is being taken.\" \"Muniyappa, who is a senior Dalit leader in the party, was defeated (in Kolar) openly by those within...no action is being taken against them. \"At Mandya, our party leaders openly met and campaigned for (Independent candidate) Sumalatha...no action against them,\" he pointed out, claiming that he was being selectively targeted. Baig said he had ensured a lead for the Congress from his Shivajinagar constituency in the city, while the BJP got ahead in the poll race from the constituencies represented by the KPCC president and the CLP leader respectively. \"What I have said about a few of our state leaders is the opinion of thousands of our karyakartas,\" he said. Baig, a seven-time MLA and a former Karnataka minister, has been unhappy with the state Congress leadership over not being included in the coalition cabinet headed by Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy. The senior leader said he felt \"sorry\" for Gandhi and alleged that the Lok Sabha poll campaign in Karnataka was run in such a way that \"we were not involved and there was no political management\". \"...I have not criticised Rahul Gandhi. He is the Indian National Congress president. I am in the Indian National Congress, not in the Siddu Congress. \"I am a disciplined soldier of the Indian National Congress and was upset about the state of the party in Karnataka. I had said those things after seeing the exit polls, even before the results,\" he said. Gundu Rao had Tuesday said Baig's alleged links with IMA Jewels, which is involved in an alleged financial fraud that duped thousands of investors, would also be brought to the notice of the party's central leadership. State Revenue Minister R V Deshpande had Monday said Baig had introduced the firm's owner, Mohammed Mansoor Khan, to him about two months ago, but denied doing any undue favour to him. Not willing to comment on the IMA Jewels case, Baig said the matter was before a Special Investigation Team (SIT). \"I will tell the SIT whatever I need to,\" he said.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Channabasappa, 30, a resident of Devanahalli and from Gadag district, told the court that he is a government employee and was driving the ambulance in a careful manner and was on the way to attend an emergency case when the accident occurred on the night of May 27. A vehicle ahead of him had suddenly applied brakes and to avoid hitting it, he swerved to the right, resulting in the accident, he added. Channabasappa also contended that Yelahanka traffic police had booked him under the various charges, including culpable homicide under IPC section 304, though there was no sufficient ingredient in the incident. The public prosecutor argued that the driver had knowledge that his negligent act would have caused the death of some innocent persons. Though the accused may not have had intention to kill anybody, his act of negligence coupled with the knowledge that his act would cause death was a crucial aspect that the court had to consider. He pointed out that the investigation report disclosed that the accused was on official duty, but was proceeding towards his residence in Devanahalli. Considering all these, the judge opined that the negligent act of the accused resulted in the death of five persons and it was not a fit case to grant bail at this stage, as the investigation is still under way. Dipankar Dey, 42, his wife Swagata Choudhury, 42, their only son Druva Dey, 14, Swagata\u2019s mother Jayathi, 65 and Dipankar\u2019s elder sister Sujaya, 46, all from West Bengal, were returning home after the departure of a flight was put off to 6.30am when the incident occurred. Court cites SC order in infamous Alister Anthony Pareira caseRash or negligent driving on a public road with the knowledge that the act could cause death could be a fit case for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the Supreme Court had said in its decision in the Alister Anthony Pareira v/s State of Maharashtra case in 2012. \u201cOn going through the above ruling of the Supreme Court, there is no confusion about the question of law or provision of law applicable to this type of case. Here is a case where the accused, being a responsible government servant and having knowledge of the consequences of his act of driving, drove his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner, crossed the divider and hit the oncoming vehicle, which resulted in death of five innocent lives... Hence the act of the investigating officer in pressing section IPC 304 at this stage is valid,\u201d said K Narayana Prasad, 55th additional city civil & session judge, in his order on Saturday. Alister Anthony Pareira, who was from a family of real estate developers, driving a Toyota Corolla, had mowed down seven people on Carter Road, Mumbai in 2006.

Punati Sridhar, principal chief conservator of forests, told TOI he has communicated the same to luxury watchmaker Rolex though its Twitter handle and is awaiting its response. \u201cEven to facilitate payment in a single case, one has to interact with forest department officers. No such interactions happened with Wild Seve. Moreover, the department pays ex gratia and not compensation. So the claim of \u2018compensation\u2019 itself is flawed,\u201d stated Sridhar, who reiterated the same in his Facebook post on Tuesday. The department said the director of Bandipur Tiger Reserve, where Wild Seve claims to have worked, had issued a press note on May 17 stating its claims were false. The note had said that no organisation, individual and NGO was involved in facilitating the process of payment of compensation for crop damage or death of livestock due to attacks by wild animals and hence, any such claims are baseless and far from the truth. On the allegations made by the forest department, the Centre for Wildlife Studies \u2014 Krithi is its executive director \u2014 said the press statement (by forest department) and social media posts are factually incorrect and may mislead the potential rural beneficiaries of Wild Seve. \u201cThe programme is being implemented on private land or public access areas outside notified forest areas directly administered by the forest department. It is implemented by us directly in collaboration with individuals who are victims of wildlife conflict incidents. We intervene and assist them only after they voluntarily seek our help. It is perfectly legal. We have, so far, operated the Wild Seve programme around Bandipur and Nagarahole national parks with over 13,702 claims filed on behalf of 6,505 individual beneficiaries. The programme doesn\u2019t claim that it has provided direct compensation as is alleged in some recent media posts,\u201d a CWS statement said. The statement further said any unbiased observer can examine Wild Seve\u2019s record on the ground and they will be happy to share details with those interested.

In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

It plans to induct 500 buses under the lease model in the second phase. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for 500 e-buses on a lease model under FAME II, but the Centre is likely to give funds for only 300,\u201d said an official. A decision on the specifications of buses and other infrastructure requirements will be taken in a few weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll send a new proposal to the Centre to avail the FAME II scheme before July 18,\u201d he added. Several states including Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Delhi have already inducted e-buses on a lease basis. The BMTC's earlier plan to induct 80 e-buses on lease basis under FAME-I (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India) was delayed after transport minister DC Thammanna insisted they be purchased. The BMTC board in February had scrapped the earlier tender to induct 80 e-buses on lease and opted for the purchasing model. A BMTC official said it\u2019s a policy decision. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to loss the FAME II subsidy as well. The new tender will plug loopholes in the earlier one,\u201d he added. Another BMTC official said they are exploring both purchase and lease model. \"If there is financial assistance from the state government, then we will purchase e-buses\". However, 80 e-buses would have hit the city roads by now if the BMTC had gone ahead with its earlier proposal. These buses were supposed to start service in August 2018 itself. Under FAME-II scheme, department of heavy industry had invited expressions of interest from state transport departments for deployment of 5,000 e-buses across the country under the operational cost model. Six firms keen on project Under criticism for delay in inducting e-buses, cash-strapped BMTC in March had called expressions of interest from global firms to supply 1,500 electric buses in another five years. However, the corporation is not in a financial position to procure 1,500 vehicles, each costing between Rs 1 crore and Rs 2 crore, without support from the Centre and the state government. The state has so far not committed any financial assistance to purchase e-buses. Sources said six companies \u2014 Olectra Greentech Ltd, Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors, Edison Motors, JBM Group and AMS Electric Mobility Limited \u2014 have shown interest in the project. In fact, Olectra Greentech Ltd had emerged as the lowest bidder (Rs 37.5 per km to operate AC e-buses and Rs 24.5 per km for non-AC buses) under the lease model in the BMTC\u2019s earlier tender. The BMTC was the first state-run bus corporation in the country to have conducted trial runs of e-buses as early as in 2014. Cash-starved BMTC to borrow Rs 160cr The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has decided to borrow Rs 160 crore to pay off its dues, said sources in the corporation. Sources in BMTC\u2019s accounts department said they have recently invited expression of interest from nationalised/scheduled commercial banks to avail a loan of Rs 160 crore. \u201cThe proposed loan will be drawn in one go. The tenure of the loan will be a period of seven years. Offers are invited both for fixed and variable interest rates,\u201d a senior BMTC official, adding that the corporation has been struggling to pay post-retirement benefits and other arrears. \u201cThe financial situation has turned from bad to worse after salary revision and fall in passenger revenue. The government is also not allowing to revise the fares despite hike in diesel and maintenance costs. It has not provided adequate financial assistance so far,\u201d claimed another official.

Spike in offences comes with rise in Namma Metro ridership": {"description": "BENGALURU: The rise in patronage of Namma Metro has, regrettably, been accompanied by a steep spike in revolting and antisocial behaviour on the city\u2019s showpiece transit system. Records show that Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL), which now has a daily ridership of 3.7 lakh, had since 2013 fined 1,373 passengers a total of Rs 3.3 lakh for offences as varied as spitting on coaches and in stations, creating a nuisance and drunkenness, unlawful entry and obstructing officials on duty. The number of cases spiraled from 10 in 2013 to 464 in 2017 and 469 in the first five months of May 2019. TimesViewNamma Metro promises to enhance connectivity in Bengaluru exponentially in quality and scale within the next five years. It is already both the flagship of the city\u2019s burgeoning transportation network and a lifeline for lakhs of commuters. It is a disgrace that some customers damage the system and inconvenience other patrons with inconsiderate conduct. It may be cynical to believe that neither awareness campaigns nor rational counsel will make any difference to their behaviour, but for now it appears that only harsh fines will have a deterrent effect.In a country where expectorating in every direction comes as naturally to certain people as discharging saliva does to peeved llamas, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that spitting tops the list of violations: 1,133 cases in seven years have attracted fines of Rs 2.2 lakh. The fact that 365 people were fined Rs 61,950 for the offence in 2018 clearly had little preemptive effect \u2014 391 commuters were booked for the violation till May 2019. Officials report that several commuters spit paan and gutka on the tiled floors and walls of Metro stations. Creating a nuisance/ drunkenness was the second-biggest problem, with 115 cases in seven years, followed by unlawful entry (84), obstructing officials on duty (30), carrying away tokens (eight) and traveling in Metro coaches reserved for women (three). Worryingly, especially for women passengers, the number of Metro users booked for causing a nuisance especially while drunk increased from a mere three each in 2013, 2014 and 2015 to eight in 2016 before vaulting to a record 50 in 2017. There have been 43 cases so far this year. Delhi Metro provides its security staff with alcometers, which has proved a deterrent to drunken behaviour, but BMRCL is yet to consider taking such a step. Then, of course, are those patrons who delight in obstructing officials from discharging their duty. Their numbers increased from three in 2016 to 17 in 2017, dipped to one in 2018, before rising to seven till May this year. Unlawful entry into Metro stations and rakes also rose from four in 2016 to 48 in 2017; there were eight cases in 2018 and 24 in 2019. This year, for the first time, BMRCL booked men for travelling in women\u2019s coaches. The three men were fined a total of Rs 600. The Metro Railway (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002, stipulates that, depending on the nature of the violation, offenders may be fined between Rs 50 and Rs 5,000 and/or face imprisonment. \u201cWe are looking to take punitive action against offenders under the act so as not to inconvenience other passengers,\u201d a BMRCL official said.

He had called AICC general secretary KC Venugopal a buffoon, criticised what he called Siddaramaiah\u2019s \u201carrogant attitude\u201d and described KPCC president Dinesh Gundurao as a flop leader. \u201cIf speaking the truth amounts to anti-party activity, then let it be,\u201d Baig said. \u201cIn a democracy, such open and transparent discussions [his comments against leaders] are required to strengthen the party. Closed-door discussions within the four walls of a hall will not help.\u201d Baig also took exception to being singled out for disciplinary action, claiming others who had openly worked against the Congress during the Lok Sabha elections got away without so much as a slap on the wrist. \u201cCongress leaders in Mandya openly campaigned for independent Sumalatha Ambareesh,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Tumakuru, former MLA KN Rajanna worked against the coalition candidate HD Deve Gowda, party leaders openly said they will defeat KH Muniyappa in Kolar, a senior Dalit leader and former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi has been continuing his tirade against the party, but no action has been taken against any of these people. Why action only against me? For speaking the truth?\u201d The Shivajinagar MLA said he will discuss with senior leaders Mallikarjun M Kharge, Ramalinga Reddy, Muniyappa, HK Patil and his supporters before firming up future plans. \u201cAfter that, I will take a call whether I need to go to New Delhi,\u201d he said.

A surprise pick by the ruling BJP-led NDA   , Birla's name was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself for the post, sources said. The 56-year-old leader is considered to be close to both Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah. Birla's nomination for the Lok Sabha Speaker's post also has the   backing of non-NDA parties   such as the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). Starting his political journey as a student leader, Birla was also elected to the Rajasthan Assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. He won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was again elected this year from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. Birla defeated Congress's Ramnarayan Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently-concluded general election. A conscientious parliamentarian, Birla has registered an 86-per cent average attendance in the House, asked 671 questions, participated in 163 debates and introduced six private members' bills in the 16th Lok Sabha. From 1991 to 2003, he was a key leader in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) as a state-level president first and then, as a vice-president at the national level. Birla, who holds a Masters degree in commerce, is a member of the Standing Committee on Energy in Parliament, the Committee on Petitions and the Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. He succeeds eight-time MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Lok Sabha Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this is not the first time that a relative newcomer has occupied the position. In 1996, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader G M C Balayogi, also a two-time MP then, was elected as the Speaker in the Lower House of Parliament.

Instead it was glasses and glasses of rice beer and a chicken sacrifice that welcomed Devang Singh and Varud Gupta when they visited Rongmesek, a tiny village in Meghalaya, to observe a holy ceremony that was being conducted by the Karbi tribe. Singh and Gupta had undertaken the trip as part of research for their recently- launched book, Bhagwaan ke Pakwaan. The book, as the name suggests, is an indepth, incisive yet tongue-in-cheek exploration of India\u2019s aeons-old temple food traditions, which continue to thrive and satiate the hunger pangs of millions of visitors, irrespective of their religious beliefs. \u201cWe were quietly taken to the site of the chicken sacrifice. One of the interesting sights that still remains with me was watching the village elder clean the intestine of the chicken with rice beer,\u201d says Singh with a pause for added effect. It takes some time for one to digest the fact that an offering to god needn\u2019t be limited to a laddoo, pedha or payasam. \u201cWhen we set out to write the book we were clear that we didn\u2019t want to write a pious book, nor was it going to focus only on prasad or bhog (the food served to god). We instead wanted to look at how food and faith mix, and in our country, they have always mixed,\u201d says Singh. This search for the seamsless marriage of food and faith took Singh and Gupta to certain unusual locations: Rongmesek, the Christian village in Meghalaya; a monastery in Spiti valley; the Jewish Synagogue in Kolkata; Udvada, Gujarat which is the most sacred fire temple for Parsis in the country; and the Jagannath Temple in Puri that is famous for the 56-course meals that are served every day, all year. Last Sunday, at Ahara, a food and wellness workshop that was held in Bengaluru, musician and popular food and travel TV host Rakesh Raghunathan took his audiences on a sensorial journey as he spoke, sang and gave a live demonstration of the preparation of Akkaraadisal (rice cooked in milk with jaggery). A prasadam that is offered at the Srivilliputtur Andal temple, Tamil legend says that this was the food that Andal had promised Lord Ranganatha if he married her. \u201cShe promised to make him 100 thadas (tanks) of Akkaraadisal and 100 thadas of ghee,\u201d narrated Raghunathan who made a presentation called Sacred Offerings at the event. \u201cIt is a popular presentation series that I have made on our temple food traditions. The idea here is to try and appeal to the five senses of the audience through music, food and mythological stories.\u201d For Raghunathan, a keen foodie since he can remember, exploring temple food traditions is an offshoot of his wider interest in documenting south India\u2019s culinary variety. \u201cI have been documenting less-known recipes that have been handed down generations and it was during my travels that I got curious about temple food,\u201d he says. \u201cDoing research on prasadam, I realised, was a great way to learn about local regions, their geographies, agricultural practices, the local produce and their cooking traditions,\u201d he says, before noting how a common temple prasadam as simple as a puliyogare (tamarind rice) varied from one state to another. \u201cWhat\u2019s unique about temple cuisine is that it is adapted to suit the place. So, if in Kerala you have temples offering prasadam made with jaggery/or jackfruit(the local produce), in Andhra, where the climate e common offer- panakkam, a drink that helps cool your body.\u201d A PRACTICE OF FEEDING PEOPLE \u201cThe practice of naivedya \u2013 one of the sixteen upacaras acts) of a puja orship) \u2013 seems have been in from at least the f Ramayana\u2019s on, where we learn of the recommendation that naivedya should be what everyone\u2019s food was. Modern-day priests offer more pragmatic explanations for the development of the naivedya and prasad tradition. Babu Shastri, one of the head priests of the Kanchipuram Kamatciyamma Temple, told me that he suspected that the naivedya tradition developed because devotees would come from far away, or at least travel a great length of time to come to a temple and see a deity,\u201d explains Andrea Gutierrez, Researcher, University of Texas. SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRACTICES \u201cWhen we set down to write the book, we didn\u2019t want to look at temple food only on basis of taste, but also on how they came about. In Spiti, for instance, the food served in monasteries is nonvegetarian because that is their staple diet. And there used to be a time when they\u2019d cook kala mattar (black pea), which is tastier than green peas but that has become rare now. Similarly in Meghalaya, rice beer was a part of every ritual,\u201d explains Singh. The biggest takeaway from writing the book for Singh has been about learning how temple food, minus the religious angle, epitomized sustainable food practices, be it in using local, seasonal ingredients or using sustainable slow cooking methods. \u201cThe reason that food cooked in temples tastes so good is because it is cooked with a lot of devotion, but there\u2019s also technique involved. Use of fresh local ingredients, cooking all components of a dish from scratch, and the fact that it is cooked without being tasted because it is a holy offering differentiates it from other cuisines we have,\u201d says chef Aditya Fatepuria, who runs Sattvam restaurant and is one of the few who has trained in cooking food based on sattvic principles. \u201cTemple food was almost always made using seasonal food. Historically, for instance, dishes were made only using indigenous ingredients like moong dal and pepper. Items like chillies came later. Even today, if you look at the offering made during the yearly observance of the departed, only moong dal is used. And only country vegetables like snake gourd, bitter gourd and raw bananas are used,\u201d explains Raghunathan. As someone who holds workshops and has hosted temple food festivals for five star hotels, Raghunathan says that these initiatives are attempts to make people aware of our heritage. \u201cThese are recipes that are 1000s of years old. I think we have taken our food legacy for granted and so I do this because I want to share it with everybody.\u201d Unusual Temple Foods From dried fish and toddy to insect chutney and rice beer, there are holy spaces in India that serve prasadam that is not conservative by any measure. \u201cThe Karbi tribe make a chutney made out of cicadas (insects that appear once in four years), and I think that was probably the most unusual sacred offering I have heard of,\u201d says Devang Singh. For Raghunathan, it\u2019s the payasam served at the Suryanallar temple in Kumbakonam that stands out. \u201cI had the priest tell me rather enthusiastically about how the offering was made of broken wheat and not rice because according to myth the Sun God is toothless,\u201d he laughs. Other temples that have unusual offerings include the Sri Muthappan Temple in Kannur, Kerala where toddy and dried fish is served. The Muniyandi Swami temple in Vadakkampatti, Tamil Nadu holds a three-day festival in January where over 2,000 kg of rice and mutton is cooked and served to devotees. Meals Ready It would be a rueful comment from his mentor, Darshini man R Prabhakar, on how none of the restaurants in Bengaluru served food as safe and tasty as a temple meal that would goad Raghavendra Padukone to start Temple Meals in Malleswaram. Placing high emphasis on quality, the food served here takes inspiration from fare served in south Canara temples. \u201cWe do not use onion or garlic, the rice is parboiled, the spices and powders we use are made in Udupi and the vegatables are handpicked,\u201d says Padukone. The formula is a success and its proof is the long line of customers who wait for the tasty elle oota everyday. \u201cWe serve 400-500 meals per day,\u201d says Padukone. (Inputs from Aparna Sridhar) Look beyond the staple laddoo or pedha and you will discover a variety in India\u2019s temple cuisine that boggles the mind and palate.

Over the last couple of weeks, the Kannada Development Authority (KDA) has held talks with Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) officials on teaching Kannada in these schools. However, the KDA has been told that most of the 50 KVs in the state do not have teachers or students for the language. According to the KDA, Kannada as a language has been made mandatory in all schools, including KVs in the state, under the Kannada Language Learning Act, 2015.\u201cHowever, it has come to light that KVs are not teaching the language due to lack of students. We are seeking clarifications from the state government and the Centre on this,\u201d said KDA chairman SG Siddaramaiah. Sources in KDA say, KVs are trying to \u201cevade\u201d teaching Kannada, as it\u2019d mean additional budgetary and academic burden on them. \u201cThey show Kannada as an option initially and later withdraw the same, even if parents are keen on their wards learning the language. For example, in Mysuru, there are only five students at one KV. However, the school principal has said they require at least 20 students to offer Kannada as a language option. This means those five students will have to study Sanskrit, the only other third-language option in the state,\u201d said one KDA member. KVS authorities admit there is shortage of teachers and students for the language. \u201cAs per our sangathan policy, a regional language can be taught at our institutions only if there are 20 or more students in each of our schools. Even for this, we have to budget for a language teacher on contract and cannot hire permanent staff,\u201d explained one senior KVS official. The authorities, however, were quick to add that though they were keen on implementing the regional language as a subject, they haven\u2019t done so also due to a particular point in the Kannada Language Learning Act. \u201cThe Act mentions only private, aided and state government schools. However, there is no mention of central government schools. Effectively, this does make it difficult for the sangathan to implement the regional language policy,\u201d said a senior KVS official. However, with the KDA and KV officials having held discussion, the regional office will be writing to the sangathan in New Delhi on how best to address the issue. Q-papers, marksheets, PhD submissions in KannadaThe state has issued a government order asking all varsities in Karnataka to issue bilingual question papers, marksheets and PhD summaries. It has also instructed universities to allow students in all courses to write exams in the language of their choice, options being English and Kannada. The order has already been implemented by the six agriculture and horticulture universities, while 18 other varsities are yet to implement the same.

Assuring the pubic of fulfilling their expectations despite feeling the pain, the chief minister said he had the responsibility of running the government. \"I can't give the reason behind my pain now, as am responsible to run the state well and ensure the officials has the confidence in running the government,\" said Kumaraswamy. A fractured verdict in the 2018 assembly poll threw up a hung House with none of the three mainstream parties securing the halfway mark (113) for a simple majority to form a government on their own.

The health department has empowered deputy commissioners to constitute Arogya Raksha Samithis involving physicians, surgeons, paediatricians, gynaecologists and other specialists, who will visit taluk and district hospitals and public health centres on call to treat patients and pay them the same amount they get in private hospitals. The scheme, conceptualised last year, kicked in January this year. Due to the Lok Sabha polls, the implementation had been delayed. \u201cThe committee will frequently meet and analyse shortage of specialties in public health institutions and fix on-call rates for different types of cases, taking into consideration fees charged by specialists in private hospitals,\u2019\u2019 said Pankaj Kumar Pandey, commissioner, state health department. The rates will be fixed based on taluks and regions. \u201cLocal problems, availability of specialists in private sector, convenience of transport and distance to nearest specialty hospital will be taken into consideration. The committee will have the liberty to fix high rates after giving valid reasons,\u201d Pandey said. Once rates are fixed, the district health officer will advertise in local newspapers for on-call specialists. Depending on the response, he\u2019ll constitute panels involving 4-8 specialists in each field. In 2017-18, the Karnataka government had rolled out the \u2018specialists on call\u2019 scheme to create a pool of specialists in every district of the state to overcome shortage of doctors and avoid wastage of resources in staterun hospitals under the National Health Mission. Quality healthcare for all \u2018Revised on-call fees will push doctors to go to govt hospitals\u2019However, there was poor response from private doctors because the government had standardised the oncall fees in all districts. \u201cIt failed as the on-call fee for a doctor in a private hospital in Bengaluru was the same as that for a doctor in a private hospital in Yadgir (a backward district),\u201d said a senior health officer. \u201cWith the fees hiked, the government will pay the deficit,\u2019\u2019 Pandey said. As per health department estimates, about 3,000 posts of doctors, including 1,400 specialists, are vacant statewide. Many specialists appointed since 2015 haven\u2019t reported for duty. Health activist Somashekar Bhandari said: \u201cThis scheme may encourage doctors in the private sector. However, why would a doctor travel long distances to treat a patient when she can earn the same money by consulting at 3-4 private hospitals within a 5km range?,\u2019\u2019 he asked. \u201cThe revised rates on par with other private hospitals will encourage doctors to go to government hospitals,\u201d said Bengaluru-based gynaecologist Dr K Kishore. DNB doctors in Karnataka To deal with shortage of specialists, the Union health & family welfare ministry allotted 80 specialists seats to Karnataka under DNB (Diplomate in National Board) courses. Last year, the parliamentary standing committee on health recommended that the DNB awarded by the National Board of Examination is equivalent to Doctor of Medicine (MD), except in teaching. Health commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey said these doctors have to do three years on-the-job training and then sign a bond of 5 years with the government.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Since our apartment is located close to a bend, it\u2019s nearly impossible to spot speeding vehicles coming towards you. This is why the driver always parks close to the apartment gate.

It was highly irresponsible of both the bus driver and the attendant to let go of the boy without ensuring he safely crossed the road, and they should be brought to book. Parents hand over their children to schools with an unwavering faith that the little ones would be well taken care of. Monday\u2019s tragic incident should serve as a constant reminder for all stakeholders that they can\u2019t be lax with safety, as a split second of oversight could turn fatal.\"Safety of children is the responsibility of all stakeholders, including parents, guardians, bus drivers and attendants. We do insist that a parent or guardian (with parents\u2019 permission) picks a child up from where we drop him/her, in whose absence, the child is either escorted to his home by the attendant or brought back to the school where he/she can stay safe until parents arrive. Each of the 100 buses in our fleet comes with a woman attendant. We regularly conduct sessions for them and the drivers to hone their driving and other skills; we also get their eyes tested. This must happen across all schools in the state,\" said Manju Balasubramaniam, principal, Delhi Public School, Bangalore North. Immaculate Christopher, principal of Sophia Nursery Primary School on Old Airport Road, said extra attention must be paid to children from nursery and primary sections since they may not know how to navigate through traffic. \"We always ensure that a child is escorted by an attendant on his/her way back home from school.

Thanks to the near-constant drought, about three-quarters of the estimated 39,000 traditional kalyanis (ponds) and tanks that existed two decades ago across the state have either dried up, been encroached upon or have been turned into sewage dumps, leading to an alarming fall in groundwater levels. With water now scarce in most districts, the government has launched an ambitious project to rejuvenate the state\u2019s age-old water system. Titled Jalamrutha, the community-driven programme is aimed at blunting the impact of climate change and battling drought. \u201cOur focus is on spreading water literacy, rejuvenation and construction of conservation structures, smart use of water and afforestation drives,\u201d said LK Atheeq, principal secretary, rural development and panchayat raj department. \u201cThe goal is to make Karnataka water secure by 2020.\u201d Under the project, the government intends to rejuvenate at least 14,000 lakes and tanks this year with the help of communities at the gram panchayat level. There are about 6,068 gram panchayats in the state. The government will also construct 20,000 check dams across major rivers to retain water upstream to help recharge the groundwater table. \u201cCheck dams also help conserve rainwater as it prevents discharge into the sea,\u201d said a senior RDPR official who is overseeing the project. \u201cThey also provide fresh water bodies for local use and strengthen the ecosystem and local bio-diversity.\u201d Officials say by the end of June, every gram panchayat will have planted 500 saplings in schools, hostels, government buildings and community complexes besides near water bodies and other public places to develop social forestry. \u201cAbout 20 lakh saplings have already been planted,\u201d said Atheeq. \u201cWe are encouraging communities to help nurture two crore saplings.\u201d The state government has earmarked about Rs 5,000 crore for the project and the government has already allocated about Rs 600 crore for the first phase. Construction of check dams, revival of small water bodies and planting of trees will also be funded under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA). However, GN Girish, a green activist, said that while the plan looks good on paper, it may not work. \u201cEvery year, the forest department plants around two crore saplings, but green cover in the state continues to diminish,\u201d Girish said. \u201cGovernment programmes often start with a bang, they fail to deliver.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "time": "2019-06-20 07:59:00", "datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/to-battle-drought-govt-moots-ambitious-plan-to-revive-rural-water-bodies/articleshow/69864261.cms"}, "B'luru para swimmer wins 5 gold medals in Norway": {"time": "2019-06-18 10:43:00", "link": "https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/others/bengaluru-para-swimmer-wins-5-gold-medals-in-norway/articleshow/69831979.cms", "description": ""}, "Bipasha Basu": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/wife-bipasha-basu-posted-a-meme-on-hubby-karan-singh-grover-and-we-cant-stop-laughing/videoshow/69856115.cms", "description": ""}, "A starry launch in Bengaluru": {"description": "Daddy opened its doors to the public on Father\u2019s Day weekend.

The play travels way back in time to pluck a portion of India\u2019s history that is more relevant now than ever before. Through the plot that revolves around an intellectual discourse about a religious succession in a matha of the Pala Empire in the eighth century, the play sheds light on a historical milieu when the ideas of Hinduism were challenged by those of Buddhism, even though the latter was on the brink of an imminent decline. Muktidham\u2019s uncanny parallels with the country\u2019s current ideas about nationalism is quite evident. \u201cThe play piques one to rethink the common argument placed by the right-wing movement that their faith is under threat now. This only reflects how they still dwell on an imagined history,\u201d says the playwright-director.  The two-hour play features a cast of prominent actors including Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwini Kumar Chakre, Ipshita Chakraborty SIngh, Irawati Karnik, Kumud Mishra, Neel Sengupta, MD Pallavi, Pratyush Singh, Sandeep Shikhar and Shubhrajyoti Barat. Apart from an extensive tour of Uttar Pradesh \u2013 covering Bareilly, Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Allahabad, Delhi and Agra \u2013 the play has also travelled to Pune and Goa, and has even won awards in 2018.  Back to Ranga Shankara, where it premiered in 2017, it\u2019s bit of a reunion for the cast and crew of the play. But why wrap up the play so soon? \u201cIt will only be the closing shows of this particular production. The text of the play is published and available for theatre groups, if they want to adapt it into another performance. Muktidham was the first play we travelled so much with. And, we have had actors from every place we visited becoming part of the cast. Travelling with a production has its own limitations, and right now we want to concentrate on newer plays,\u201d says Vivek Madan, of Bhasha Centre that is presenting the play. Light design for the show is done by Anmol Vellani, while music and sound design is handled by Abhijeet Tambe and Pallavi. Tracing the dilemma\u2026The story is set in a time when the Pala kings, who followed Buddhism, were ruling the east and large parts of northern India. It is about this Hindu temple town, called Beerpur, which is surrounded by Buddhists. The protagonist of the play is Agnivesh, a scholar in the matha. Its head, Nath Nand, who is about to retire, is in a dilemma as to who among his students should become his successor. Will it be Yuyutsu, who believes in opening up the doors of the temple for the lower castes, or Agnivesh, who believes in raising an armed resistance to Buddhism? 00:35Muktidham's last run of shows in BengaluruMuktidham: A playDownload The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "time": "2019-06-20 00:05:00", "datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-sets-the-stage-for-muktidhams-final-run/articleshow/69856665.cms"}, "Houses partially damaged due to tidal waves in Karnataka\u2019s Mangaluru": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//videos/city/bengaluru/houses-partially-damaged-due-to-tidal-waves-in-karnatakas-mangaluru/videoshow/69784351.cms", "description": ""}, "garbage overflowing onto street": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/garbageoverflowingontostreet/articleshow/69209832.cms", "description": ""}, "Bengaluru: Woman makes selfie video before committing suicide": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//videos/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-woman-makes-selfie-video-before-committing-suicide/videoshow/69855089.cms", "description": ""}, "Garbage menace at Muninanjappa Layout": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/garbagemenaceatmuninanjappalayout/articleshow/69834429.cms", "description": ""}, "Sushmita Sen": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/photos-sushmita-sen-shares-some-delightful-moments-with-her-daughters/articleshow/69851624.cms", "description": ""}, "Horoscope Today": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/astrology/horoscope/horoscope-today-june-19-2019-check-astrological-predictions-for-leo-virgo-libra-scorpio-signs-and-other/articleshow/69850234.cms", "description": ""}, "Tahira Kashyap": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/after-getting-trolled-brutally-tahira-kashyap-pens-down-an-apology-for-sitting-on-a-buddha-statue/videoshow/69863475.cms", "description": ""}, "Jaya Prada": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections-2019/andhra-pradesh/news/andhra-pradesh-to-up-jaya-prada-now-a-saffron-star/articleshow/68606957.cms", "description": "HYDERABAD: It\u2019s been a roller coaster ride for actress Jaya Prada in politics. The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

College authorities are expecting their students to bag nearly 10 per cent of government medical seats in Karnataka and about 0.7 per cent of medical seats across India. They say at least 435 students from Shaheen Group of Educational Institutions should notch up government quota medical seats in the country this time. Last year, 304 students secured government quota seats; the number was 83 in 2013. Thouseef Madikeri, CEO of Shaheen Education Foundation, told TOI: \u201cSpecial NEET coaching is given to students of classes 11 and 12. A test is conducted every week, (the level gets tougher in class 12) and students are segregated based on their ranks. Every week, the list of toppers is updated online. The slow learners get special focus. Faculty members with more than 15 years of experience train these students, who can also opt for interactive online classes.\u201d Residential students are required to dedicate four hours to study every day. Classes begin at 7.30am and end at 9pm. Residential students get a break on Sunday. For day scholars, regular class ends at 5.30pm, but they can opt for the study hours by staying on campus till 9pm. Shaheen Group founder Abdul Qadeer Sahib is credited with introducing Hifzul-Quran PlusCourse for madrassa students since 2012. The aim being to integrate Madrasa-educated students into the mainstream. In the recently concluded NEET exams, 17 students who took the Hifzul-Quran PlusCourse cleared NEET. This year, 1,176 students were specially trained for NEET at the institute\u2019s two girls and one boys campus. Also, around 2,600 students have taken admission to class 11 this academic year. \u201cFor the first time, we are expecting nearly 435 students to bag government medical seats.

So it stands to reason that inventors \u2014 who are wont to take inspiration from nature \u2014 would by now have had a brainwave or two about the potential for innovation from this incredible organ. And scientists have, over the past decade or so, modelled automated arms after the elephant trunk, including for operations in industrial settings, in agriculture and even as an aid for people with disabilities. But perhaps for the first time ever, a team of researchers from International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIIT-B) and National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Nimhans) is awaiting a patent for a robot prototype \u2014 a hyperflexible bionic probe \u2014 inspired by an elephant\u2019s trunk and developed for brain surgery. The new device will allow surgeons to perform brain surgeries via a single port \u2014 an incision to insert equipment \u2014 and with just one probe. \u201cThis will change things completely. Surgeons now require multiple ports and numerous probes to do the same job,\u201d said Prof Madhav Rao of IIIT-B. While the robot is still a long way away from being deployed in operation theatres, its inventors say it could be the first of a series of products that revolutionise surgeries. Among other things, the robot, christened \u2018Mythri\u2019, can be manoeuvred within the body to ferret out cysts or tumours. Dr Vikas Vazhiyal of Nimhans recalled that he approached Rao and his team in 2016 with an idea for the product. \u201cRobotics had been around for a while in medicine, but not really in neuroscience,\u201d Vazhiyal said. \u201cI felt there was an opportunity and we began work on the idea.\u201d \u201cWe needed a flexible and light tool, and the first thing that came to mind was an elephant\u2019s trunk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe elephant\u2019s trunk is extremely tactile. It uses it to sense things, bathe, drink water and lift heavy objects. We wanted our tool to be just as versatile, something that could sneak into deep into the brain and do the work needed.\u201d Unlike the abdomen for instance, space is at a premium in the brain because so many vital parts are packed into a small place. \u201cThe elephant trunk was perfect in this respect,\u201d Vazhiyal said. \u201cFlexible robots of today are completely solid. We needed a hollow device with the equipment needed packed within.\u201d Rao said the tool uses a pulley system based on a micromotor. \u201cIt will be the first laparoscope with the ability to make three-dimensional movements,\u201d he said. Surgeons currently have to make at least two incisions for laparoscopic surgeries: One incision to insert the laparoscope, the other to manoeuvre it. Since Mythri can make 3D movements with more than 5\u00b0 of freedom, a second incision will not be required, Rao said. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed Mythri for neurosurgeries, but I\u2019m confident that it could be used in other parts of the body such as the abdomen,\u201d Vazhiyal said.

Kumaraswamy, 19, from Tumakuru, suffered a spinal injury and is undergoing treatment at Victoria hospital. Dancers say backflip is one of the most difficult moves in street style and hip-hop dancing and practising it cannot be a casual affair. Shilpa Somananthan, a dance expert who won the first place in the World Dance Championship (2018-2019), said: \u201cThree major factors matter while doing a backflip: Physical strength, presence of mind and a partner who is understanding. Even if one of these goes wrong, the dancer can easily fall and break neck.\u201d She said dancers with basic gymnastic training are better equipped to perform this move. She also pointed out that the partner needs to be firm on the ground and his/her legs must be positioned in a way that allows the dancer to run and step on his/her knees and flip in the air. \u201cA person needs to practice on the crash mat, sand or soft bed before doing it on any other surface,\u201d Shilpa said. Bharatanatyam dancer Sneha Nair said mental strength is more important than anything else while performing acrobatics in dance. A dancer normally takes a month to learn the art and two months to master the act, until which support would be advisable. \u201cMany times, our children fall and injure their legs or bruise their hand. We always keep a pillow to ensure neck is not damaged,\u201d she added. \u2018He did not use right flooring\u2019On what could have caused Kumaraswamy\u2019s accident, street dancer Princy William, who has been practising the act for eight years, said: \u201cHe did not use the right flooring to do it and his partner did not lift him properly.\u201d Kumaraswamy\u2019s relative Bharath M said the dancer\u2019s spinal cord is broken. \u201cHe tried the act twice and they were perfect. When he attempted it for the third time, it went wrong,\u201d he said.

The monk, from the Tibetan refugee colony in Mundgod, about 400km from Bengaluru, was befriended by the woman on Facebook. A complaint has been lodged with the CEN (cybercrime, economic offences and narcotics) police station in Karwar. The monk, Karma Khedup, said he joined Facebook in January 2017. Within months, the woman reached out to him on the site and introduced herself as Roland Michael, an American citizen who had grown up as an orphan. She told the elderly monk that she was keen on helping orphans in India. The two extended their friendship on WhatsApp and eventually, Roland said she wanted to settle down in India with his help. Karma heads the audio-visual archive at Drepung Loseling Meditation & Science Centre at Mundgod.

Roland then allegedly told Karma that one of her friends, a William Johnson, would come to India and work with him until she could leave US and come here. She asked Karma to contact William on his mobile phone. When Karma called him, William allegedly demanded money to pay for \"custom clearance, income tax, police verification and immigration\". William provided several bank account details and Karma transferred money in the hope of getting Roland's funds.  In his complaint, the monk said he had transferred nearly Rs 2 crore, at which point, William and Roland broke off all communication. Roland's Facebook account has also been closed.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

In a bid to build a consensus on holding simultaneous polls to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies, Modi convened the meeting of presidents of all political parties for which 40 were invited. 21 parties attended the meeting while three shared their views on the subject in writing. Amid no shows, PM Modi meets party chiefs on simultaneous pollsAddressing mediapersons after the meeting, Singh, who moderated the gathering, said most parties supported the 'one nation, one election' idea.

Milind Deora says simultaneous polls is an 'important and valuable reform', calls for debateTRS was represented by its working president K T Rama Rao. \"Most of the parties supported 'one nation one election'. There was some difference of opinion from CPM and CPI that how it will be done. And both Left parties didn't directly oppose it rather expressed apprehensions that how it will be implemented,\" he said adding, \"Prime Minister will form a committee which will hold discussions with all stake holders in a time-bound manner.\" According to sources, this panel is likely to be political in nature that will include leaders from various political parties. Singh said Modi made it clear at the meeting that the \"simultaneous polls is not government's agenda and that it is the nation's agenda.\" Quoting Modi, Singh said he told presidents of the political parties that if there is any difference of opinion it is welcome. Modi had invited the heads of all political parties which have at least one member either in the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha for the meeting to discuss several issues, including the \"one nation, one election\" idea, celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Singh said on the issue of increasing the productivity of Parliament all parties were in agreement on this. Those leaders who were present in the meeting were of the opinion that there should be cordial atmosphere for communication and discussion in the House. Leaders of various parties emphasised that the young generation should be aware about the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, Singh said. Those who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPM's Sitaram Yechury, CPI general secretary S Sudhakar Reddy, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conard Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti, National Conference patriarch Farooq Abdullah and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owais also attended. Besides Modi and Singh, the government was represented by Union home minister Amit Shah, his cabinet colleagues Nitin Gadkari and Pralhad Joshi. BJP's new working president JP Nadda was also present. Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday that she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Talking to reporters after the meeting, Yechury described the concept of simultaneous polls as \"anti-democracy and anti-federalism\" and said \"the BJP is trying to bring in president form of government structure through back door.\" On celebrations of 150 years of birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Yechury said the best tribute to the Father of Nation could be by taking stringent action against those who are glorifying his assassin and enacting a strong law against mob lynching. BJD's Naveen Patnaik, who supported the government's idea of simultaneous polls, demanded the inclusion of the words peace and non-violence in the preamble of the Constitution. Sources said that the opposition parties want proper discussion before going ahead with simultaneous polls. Last August, the Law Commission had recommended holding simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft, submitted to the law ministry, however, cautioned that \"holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution\". The Centre has been toying with the idea for quite some time now. \"The Prime Minister called for widespread debate and consultations on simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas, keeping in view various aspects such as the resulting financial savings and consequent better utilisation of resources,\" an official release said last week after Modi addressed a NITI Aayog meeting. The government think-tank, NITI Aayog, last year suggested synchronised two-phase Lok Sabha and Assembly polls from 2024 to ensure minimum campaign-mode disruption to governance.

However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

Monsoon hit the coast on June 13, delayed by five days for the first time in recent years. It has become persistently weak since then with only districts like Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Uttara Kannada and Kodagu receiving rain, according to Srinivas Reddy, director, Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC). Usually, monsoon enters the coast between June 7 and 9 and spreads across the state by June 19. But that hasn\u2019t been the case this year. \u201cTill now, monsoon has covered just 20 per cent of Karnataka. Moreover, no cloud formation and pressure are being seen anywhere in the state, which is really a worrying factor,\u201d Reddy said hinting at a continued dry spell in the coming days. The rainfall data of KSNDMC shows none of the 30 districts received normal rainfall between June 11 and 17. The average rainfall deficit touched 80 per cent in most districts of south interior and north interior Karnataka during the period. For example, the cumulative rainfall in south interior Karnataka between June 1 and 17 is 19 per cent more than normal while it has received 79.7 per cent less rainfall between June 11 and 17, indicating a sharp decrease. Even in coastal districts, which have been witnessing showers for the few days, the figures are below normal. Sowing takes a beatingElusive showers have also impacted sowing activities across the state, mainly in rain-fed North Karnataka. As per data provided by the office of the agriculture director, of the 76.7 lakh hectares of targeted area under kharif crops, sowing has taken place only in 6.9 lakh hectares, including 3.3 lakh hectares of irrigated land. In 10 districts of North Karnataka, including Bidar, Vijayapura, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Gadag and Haveri, no sowing has been done. \u201cThis is almost 10 percentage points less than the area usually covered by the second week of June.

The cabin crew member on AI 772, that was preparing for take-off to Kolkata with boarding completed, took offence and then the two almost came to blows in full view of passengers. When informed of the situation by other crew on board, the airline immediately grounded both of them and the flight operated with a delay of two hours after calling in another captain and purser.

Both are accusing the other of pushing them first which led to the fight. This issue is being probed to see exactly what led to the fight.\" The fight led to the flight being delayed by over two hours. AI 772 has a schedule departure time of 11.15 am from Bengaluru and arrives in Kolkata two hours later. On Monday when the fight broke out, the flight left Bengaluru at 1.22pm after AI got a replacement crew as the captain and flight purser had been grounded. Luckily this fight did not erupt mid air and happened when the aircraft was on the ground at the airport. In the past, airlines have witnessed midair fights between crew members too. A senior pilot said, \"Crew members fighting on board aircraft, or during layovers between flights, is simply not acceptable. It does not matter who started the fight , the other person should have acted with restraint, maturity and filed a report with the management for further action,\" said a senior pilot.
