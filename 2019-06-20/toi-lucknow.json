The Uttar Pradesh Private University Ordinance 2019 was passed by the state cabinet on Tuesday. Clarifying the government\u2019s stand on seeking an undertaking from private universities that they would not allow any anti-national activity on their campuses in accordance with the ordinance, state education minister Dinesh Sharma told TOI on Wednesday that universities are centres of learning and there should be no room for such activities. While the exact parameters of what constitutes anti-national activity have not been defined, Sharma said he referred to the 2016 \u2018tukde tukde\u2019 incident in JNU to state that \u201csuch activities\u201d would not be allowed. \u201cPrivate universities should be centres of educational excellence and we will promote them in that fashion. But anti-national and anti-social activities, which weaken unity and disrupt education, will not be tolerated. In some universities, anti-national slogans have been raised like \u2018Bharat tere tukde honge\u2019 and objectionable terms used to define the nation. In UP, we are here to teach and study, not to engage in any activity that seeks to divide,\u201d said Sharma. Adding that universities would be held liable if anything objectionable was said or done on their campuses, Sharma said that the new ordinance would act as a shield for universities. By making a university liable, he said, its administration would ensure that no anti-national activity was carried out on the campus as it would not want to be shut down. \u201cNow they can fix their agenda and let those speaking on campus know what cannot be said or discussed. The ordinance guarantees the right to speech but will not allow any anti-national activity. One is free to criticise leaders and the country but demanding its division is not permitted,\u201d added Sharma. Claiming that the ordinance ensured independence to universities while equipping the government to act like a chowkidaar, the education minister added that even in the distribution of honorary degrees, the government would not be recommending names but only clearing those proposed by the universities. Giving the example of former JNU president Kanhaiya Kumar, who has been charged for his involvement in the \u2018tukde tukde\u2019 incident, Sharma said that if the court was to clear his name in the case, the government would have no objection if he were to be given an honorary degree. \u201cWe have no objection to a university inviting Kumar to speak, but he cannot say the \u2018tukde tukde\u2019 kind of things there. The college cannot claim that it did not know what he or anyone would be saying,\u201d he said. While the ordinance has been passed by the cabinet and will be presented in the upcoming assembly session scheduled to commence from July 18, Sharma remained non-committal on when it would be implemented. The 27 private universities in the state will be given one year to change their Acts in accordance with Ordinance.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

During peak hours, the time taken to negotiate this brief length is a traumatic 30 minutes, considering one is lucky. On a real bad day, the nightmare can be as long as an hour, if not more.

She \"trapped\" her targets by showing her videos and pictures with the help of a software malware released from a third-party server hosted in a West Asian country.  She was involved in the case related to the leak of classified data on BrahMos missile in 2018.  TOI has accessed her chats and the details of the malware called 'Whisper' used by her. Malware is an abbreviated form of 'malicious software' that is specifically designed to gain access to or damage a computer, usually without the knowledge of the owner .  Sejal's FB account had cropped up following the arrest of BrahMos senior systems missile projects engineer Nishant Agarwal by the UP anti-terrorism squad (ATS) and military intelligence (MI) for passing on classified information about the project to Pakistan spy agency ISI.  Sleuths in UP Police and MI have now unearthed more than five dozen chats of this female spy. \"Well install whisper n check your desktop icon, open it and send me the code, lets talk there\" the Pak spy agent says in one of the chats. \"Waiting dude? Installed? After installing u will see Whisper icon on ur desktop. Just send me the code, then we will good to go. just unzip it. n click install. it's a chat app dude In UK, we all use that (sic)\" she adds. \"Nope, its restricted. Its getting restrictd.

Both work on stealth mode and have \"self-aware\" detection techniques which make them extremely difficult to be recognised by anti-malware programmes installed in computers.  \"It's a malicious communication app. It uses a malware command. A hacker can use as many as 25 internet addresses to mask her identity,\" said a top intelligence official, closely monitoring the probe.  \"Instantly, after getting downloaded, the malware first prompts the user to key in a code. It's to ensure that the app is not a virus or malware. Immediately after that, it scans all latest attachments sent from the computer in emails or downloads. It then scans all files with photographs, databses of MS Word and MS Excel, by first verifying their encryption keys and then opening their passwords,\" said a senior intelligence official. Sejal states in her FB profile that she's an employee of a firm called 'Growth Company' in Manchester, UK.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing. Living with the dead: A grave in the backyard\"All we are asking for is some land for our ancestors. There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar. Their burial grounds are filled to capacity,\" said Nizam Khan, a mechanic. Village pradhan Sundar Kumar said that he had asked officials several times for a burial ground for Muslim families, but no action was taken. Ravi Kumar NG, the district magistrate, said that he was not aware of the issue. \"I will send an official team to the village and get details of the burial land required.\" Picture Credit: Hemant Kumar In Video:Houses turn into graveyards as Muslims in this UP village bury the dead at homeDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Satta Market": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-assembly-polls-satta-market-bets-shift-from-winner-loser-to-seat-tally/articleshow/66726353.cms", "description": "BHOPAL: This assembly  is turning out to be a nail-biter. The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

According to Ayurveda experts, the benefits of brahmi include sharpness of memory, ashvagandha has been in use for general wellness, including against depression and high blood sugar, and mashparni\u2019s benefits include boosting body energy, strengthening muscles and increasing sperm count. Undertaken by UP\u2019s public works department (PWD), the plan is an extension of NDA\u2019s flagship Ayushman Bharat Yojana. According to the detailed note by PWD, accessed by TOI, pilot project has started in 18 districts. The PWD note also blames the invasion of \u201cEnglish plants\u201d (meaning non-native species) such as cacti and bonsai (the Japanese word for growing miniature trees by stunting their growth) in homes, offices and parks, and the declining use of plants mentioned in the Ayurveda system of medicine. \u201cBesides, one of prime reasons for unfit India is shrinking open air and disappearing Ayurveda trees.

The cure is possible with help of these herbs,\u201d the note added. A pilot initiative has already been implemented on busy stretches of the Delhi-Yamunotri state highway 57 in Saharanpur, Ashapur-Sarnath state highway in Varanasi, Panchkosi Parikrama state highway in Ayodhya, the Gorakhpur-Deoria state highway, the Aligarh-Mathura highway via Keshavdham and the Banda-Bahraich stretch in Chitrakoot. \u2018UP is the 1st state to implement scheme\u2019For centuries, Indians at home have used these Ayurveda herbs, either as condiments in cooking or to cure diseases.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "UPPSC: Interviews for recruitment of 610 civil judges in UP from June 21": {"description": "LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) would conduct interviews for \u201cUP Judicial Service Civil Judges (Junior Division) Exam-2018\u201d from June 21 to July 17.

As many as 1857 aspiring judges are competing for 610 vacancies of junior division civil judge in district court across the state. One of the biggest recruitment of the judges in the state started after Allahabad high court intimated the UP department of appointment and personnel (DoAP) about the number of civil judges lying vacant across the state. Following this, a requisition of 610 posts was forwarded to the UPPSC for filing the posts, said officials. High Court has directed UPPSC to complete the recruitment in a time bound manner so as to address the issue of shortage of civil judges in the state, said Jagdish, secretary, UPPSC.

Even if you have scored as low as five marks in the Lucknow University management entrance test, you stand a chance of getting admission to the course.

A candidate scoring marks even in single digit in the entrance test is likely to get admission. This is because for admission to 600 MBA seats, only 742 candidates had appeared for the entrance test. Besides, a number of candidates did not turn up for counselling. As a result, low scorers are likely to get an opportunity for admission as the difference between the total number of seats and the number of candidates is very low. LU offers six management courses. While there is maximum rush for regular MBA, seats in other courses\u2014MBA (finance & control), MBA (human resources & industrial relations), MBA (marketing), MBA (international business) and master\u2019s in tourism and total management, often remain vacant. In the overall merit list for the six courses, all candidates from rank 1 till rank 742 have been called. The candidate with the last rank has scored 5 marks in the entrance test out of 300. \u201cA number of candidates don\u2019t take admission if they don\u2019t get admission in the most sought after MBA courses offered due to lack of career prospects.

The protesters were all scheduled caste, demanding action against their gram pradhan for providing water supply only to the village area inhabited by upper castes and not giving them any. \u201cWe are forced to walk to the handpump across our village, crossing a highway for it. When we cannot go to fill water, our children do. It is highly dangerous for them. The pradhan has diverted all the water to the area where upper caste people live. We are unable to do daily wage work because we have to get water,\u201d said Savitri, a resident. Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Bundelkhand district, one of the most backward in country, has a perennial problem of water scarcity, but the situation is worse this year. In 2018, the region saw rainfall deficiency ranging from 8% to 56%. This year, with monsoon already delayed, the rainfall deficiency between June 1 and June 18 is already being pegged from 26% to 84%. Ponds and wells have dried up and locals have to walk an hour to fetch water. The livestock is worst affected as carcasses are seen lining roads and lying scattered in fields. In the absence of jobs, failing agriculture and water shortage, most people have left for cities for temporary employment and will return to sow their fields when monsoon arrives. In Dhikwaha village of Mahoba district, 18-20 tubewells have gone dry. Princy Yadav (14) tells she has to walk an hour to the only tubewell outside the village to get water. \u201cAround 125 people from our village have gone to cities because there is neither water nor any work here. The women of the households go to fetch water in the morning, and in the evening, it\u2019s the turn of children after they return from school,\u201d she says. It takes 30 minutes to reach the tubewell, but well over two hours are actually spent in returning with water because there is a long queue at the tubewell. \u201cThere are frequent fights, as the tubewell often runs out of water and so all the people want to fill their vessels first,\u201d she said. In Dhoraiyan, residents say that 15 families left the village with the onset of summer and will return only after first monsoon rain. \u201cMonsoon had failed last year,\u201d says Pushpa, a resident. \u201cIt is delayed this time also because of which agriculture has been seriously affected. The fields are dry and there is no fodder for cattle. The wells and tubewells dried up months back. The government doesn\u2019t send any water tankers,\u201d she added. Mahoba recorded a rainfall deficit of 56% in 2018 where Banda was 8% rain deficient. This year, the pre-monsoon deficit is already 29% and 84%, respectively, with no rains yet to recharge wells and village ponds.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

An endangered species endemic to India, especially to the northern region, the number of gharials at the wildlife sanctuary have seen an over 50% rise in population. From mere 15 gharial nests in the river Girwa, wildlife conservationists at the sanctuary counted 32 nests this year. \u201cAs many as 852 hatchlings came out of eggshells in these 32 nests and went into the river. We managed to save 160 hatchlings, and will protect their life so that their population can be increased further,\u201d said Dudhwa Tiger reserve field director Ramesh Pandey. The Katarniaghat wildlife sanctuary falls under Dudhwa tiger reserve. \u201cIn 2005, there were just five gharial nests. After conservation, their count went up to 30-40 in next decade. But last year, the number went down to 15,\u201d he added. The conservationists then noticed that the sandbars used by the fish-eating narrow snout gharials were changing form significantly. This was because of over growth of tall grass, change in nature of sandbar\u2019s slopes when they got submerged in water and the presence of predators like dogs and vultures. \u201cWe systematically eliminated all of these factors, held vigils in teams and protected the eggs that the gharials hide in sandpits and the hatchlings from predators,\u201d said Pandey. Adding to the number of the species, conservationists have re-started the process of keeping back some hatchlings to help in population growth. \u201cThe 160 hatchlings we have kept with us, will be nurtured to attain strength and will be reintroduced into the river in winters so that chances of their survival improve and the survival rate is higher than when they are smaller and are in the river,\u201d said Pandey.

Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

TimesViewFrequent incidents of chain and purse snatchings in the heart of the city mean there is no fear law among petty criminals . In such a scenario, CCTV cameras and quick response by police can act as deterrents. In case of arrest, evidence in the form of footage will help speed up investigation. Severe punishment should follow, especially for repeat offenders.A police dossier has listed 255 cases of chain and cash snatching in the city since January, which effectively means one person is being targeted every 15 hours. Worse, very few of the these cases have been cracked till date in the absence of effective electronic surveillance. Indiranagar and Gomtinagar top the list of unsafe neighbourhoods with a total of 49 cases followed by Aliganj with 11. The victims were mostly morning walkers, besides working women returning home late from office. In some cases, the accused used firearms to rob their victims of valuables. On May 29, two bikers tried to rob Urmila Devi of her gold chain at gunpoint in B Block, Indiranagar. She managed to retain half of the chain. Shikha Tiwari of Mahanagar recalled the horror of June 3 when two men flashed a pistol and snatched her gold chain in broad daylight. There were no patrol teams or CCTV cameras to nail them, Tiwari said. On June 8, Rekha Shah was robbed of her gold chain right in front of a police outpost in Talkatora. It was early morning. Her husband was teaching her how to ride a scooter. There were no policemen who could come to their rescue, she recalled. Not just women, snatch gangs have targeted men too in the recent past. On June 7, Ayush Jaiswal was robbed of his wallet by two men on a bike near Bhoothnath market. He says police have done precious little to identify the culprits, let alone arrest them. Sangeeta Agarwal of Mahanagar is still afraid to go out alone. On June 11, two men on a bike snatched her chain near Gole market when she was out to buy milk. \u201cI have stopped venturing out alone since that day. Police rarely patrol the city and CCTV cameras are absent. The city has become unsafe,\u201d she said. Ayushi Garg of Vibhuti Khand, who was robbed near Kathauta Crossing in May, said Lucknow police lack a dedicated mechanism to curb snatching. \u201cLast year, my friend was targeted at Husadiya Crossing while my aunt was robbed near Viram Khand crossing in 2017. Police are yet to crack those cases or take concrete measures to prevent rerun,\u201d she said. SSP Kalanidhi Naithani denied allegations that police were not doing enough to curb bike gangs that target unsuspecting victims and speed away. \u201cWe have identified vulnerable areas.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step.

However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

Candidates and teachers are citing lack of awareness, inadequate publicity and delay in issuance of certificates by the district administration as the main reasons behind the lukewarm response. There are 3,048 undergraduate seats at LU of which 10% are reserved for EWS candidates. The admission process is almost over, but 77% of these reserved seats had no claimants till this report was filed on Wednesday. Many candidates didn't click on the EWS option in the online form as they did not have the mandatory certificate in hand while applying. \"We were afraid of being denied admission altogether if we were unable to submit the quota certificate,\" said a candidate, not willing to be named. Gitika Upadhyay, a BSc candidate who got selected under the EWS category, said there was confusion over eligibility, as the district administration did not clarify the same to candidates who did rounds of tehsils for certificates. \"Hence, many did not opt for the quota. I, however, took a chance and got lucky. I have already applied for the EWS certificate and will submit the same to LU as soon as it is issued to me,\" she added. Teachers feel the provision of reserved seats was not properly promoted by the government. Lucknow University Teachers' Association (LUTA) president Neeraj Jain said, \"The reservation policy should have been publicised in a better way by the state and its academic institutions, so that no deserving applicant missed the opportunity.\" Dean of student welfare at LU Dhruvsen Singh argued that every new provision took time to reach the masses. \"The case is same with EWS (quota). Many candidates are still not aware of what the quota is and how it can be availed of,\" he said. Singh maintained that many candidates had more queries about funds and scholarships for underprivileged students than the EWS admission quota. He added that faculty members in different university departments had spread the word about seat reservations, but their reach was understandably limited.
