You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India.

Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

The swap occurred at an ATM kiosk in Upper Bibvewadi on March 2, while the cash was withdrawn from ATMs in Bibvewadi and Dhankawdi between March 2 and 4. On March 2, 63-year-old Dattatraya Paste was trying to withdraw money from a State Bank of India ATM at Raskar Palace. When he entered the kiosk, he saw a man, in his mid-twenties, already standing inside. The money was for his granddaughter\u2019s school fees. Paste was about to insert his card into the machine, when the stranger stopped him and said he was doing it in an incorrect manner, police said. The suspect, under the pretext of showing Paste how to do it properly, took his card to demonstrate. Then, he distracted Paste and swapped his debit card for an inoperative one. The suspect returned the card to Paste and told him to insert the card into the machine again, enter his personal identification number (PIN) and withdraw the cash. The elderly man followed the suspect\u2019s directions, but, despite multiple attempts, the machine did not dispense the money. Meanwhile, the suspect memorized the PIN and quickly made his escape, police said. The same evening. Paste\u2019s daughter received a text alert that Rs20,000 was withdrawn from the account. They were unable to block the card on March 3, as it was a Sunday. However, the suspect withdrew a further Rs20,000 the same day. According to the FIR, the conman transferred Rs20,000 into the SBI account of one Mohan Ingle on Sinhagad Road on March 4. Paste\u2019s daughter got the card blocked immediately to prevent the suspect from withdrawing/transferring money from her father\u2019s account, police said. On the delay in lodging FIR, sub-inspector Kiran Lite of Bibvewadi police said Paste had submitted a complaint application after he got duped. \u201cWe conducted a preliminary inquiry and lodged his complaint under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code on Monday. The inoperative card is the name of one Vijay Kulkarni. We have send a letter to the SBI to provide CCTV footage of the fraudster,\u201d Lite said. In June, in two separate cases, the police had arrested two men for using this trick to cheat people. In one case, a Koregaon Bhima resident had swapped a woman\u2019s debit card in Alandi and spent Rs79,000 on it. In the second case, the suspect was arrested and 87 ATM cards were recovered from his possession. The previous month, a 24-year-old student lost Rs22,500 after a stranger swapped her debit card at an ATM in Koregaon Park.

The CBI pleaded that it wanted to confront Punalekar with a fresh set of evidence, including documents recovered from his seized laptops and the call data record of his cellphone. Special UAPA judge R M Pande posted the matter for a hearing on Thursday after asking the defence lawyers to make their written submission on the CBI\u2019s remand plea. The CBI\u2019s plea comes at a time when arguments over the bail pleas of Punalekar and his assistant, Vikram Bhave, were nearing completion. Special public prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi was to conclude his arguments. The arguments are now on hold. Suryavanshi told TOI, \u201cThe CBI has retrieved the data from the two laptops seized from Punalekar\u2019s office following his arrest. The CBI wants his presence in custody for further investigation in relation to this data.\u201d He added, \u201cThey also want to probe him in relation to the call data record and this was the reason it moved a remand plea. The bail proceeding will now be taken up after the remand matter is settled.\u201d Lawyer Virendra Ichalkaranji, representing Punalekar, said, \u201cWe feel the CBI\u2019s remand plea is nothing more than a tactic to prolong the matter.\u201d The CBI arrested Punalekar and Bhave on May 25 for allegedly instructing destruction of firearms used in the murders of Dabholkar in Pune on August 20, 2013, and Gauri Lankesh in Bengaluru on September 5, 2017, and aiding the two shooters in a recce, respectively. It is the probe agency\u2019s case that Sharad Kalaskar, one of the two men accused of shooting at Dabholkar, said in a statement recorded before a Karnataka magistrate on October 12, 2018, that Punalekar had told him in June 2018 to destroy the firearms used in the two murder cases. Kalaskar acted on the instruction by dismantling and throwing four firearms into a water body from the bridge at the Thane creek on July 23, 2018. Bhave is accused of accompanying Kalaskar and the other alleged shooter, Sachin Andure, for a recce on Dabholkar\u2019s routine and the escape route, the agency claimed. A Pune court had ordered the duo\u2019s remand in CBI custody till June 1, when the probe agency told the court that it had applied charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which entitled them for a total 30-day custodial remand. The court extended the remand till June 4 and ordered the duo\u2019s remand in judicial custody. They were sent to the Yerawada central jail.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing. Living with the dead: A grave in the backyard\"All we are asking for is some land for our ancestors. There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar.

Expertise in physics is the easiest way to make a career in astronomy. Tarun Souradeep, senior professor at IUCAA, said during his time, the engineering syllabus had a much broader view which allowed him to move to physics for a master\u2019s degree. \u201cIt is not the case any more as engineering has become much more focused. I do not believe that you need a specialized course in astrophysics or such in the undergraduate level to become an astrophysicist. What is required is a good fundamental knowledge of physics as everything is eventually an applied version of physics.\u201d Sukanta Bose, science lead of the LIGO-India Project, said while pure physics in graduation will do, there is a need for a master\u2019s thesis as well as smaller projects in the astronomy related field during the postgraduate course if a student wishes to have a career in astronomy. \u201cCentres like IUCAA are mandated by the University Grants Commission to expand astronomy courses in Indian universities so that at least when graduating there is enough representation of astronomy among other sciences. We are currently in process of working with Savitribai Phule Pune University to have students enrolled in MSc Physics do something exclusively in astrophysics for their master\u2019s thesis,\u201d Bose said. Varun Bhalerao, assistant professor at IIT Bombay said even if a student is unable to make a career in astrophysics despite taking up physics in their masters and PhD course, he or she can get a job in industries as they too are opening up their recruitment drives to students with a PhD. But he advises students to make sure that their PhDs are on a good subject and from a good institute. \u201cA PhD in physics means you have taken up a problem which nobody has solved as yet. In the years of research, you are solving the problem and submitting your research for your PhD degree. Industries also want people with excellent fundamental knowledge who can solve problems innovatively and research students fit the bill. While there is a huge difference in the recruitment of PhD students in foreign countries, the Indian industry is opening up too,\u201d Bhalerao said. Bhalerao who took up engineering for his bachelor\u2019s degree says despite his course work, he made sure that he kept himself up-to-date with physics and did projects in the astronomy sector. \u201cBut I got a lot of rejections when I was applying for my research in astrophysics because there were students of physics who were always given preference. Hence, if a student knows that he or she wants a career in astrophysics, it is always better to take physics in the undergraduation and specialize along with mathematics, computers and statistics,\u201d Bhalerao added. Arvind Paranjpye, director of Nehru Planetarium, said in the present scenario, engineering students have an option of doing PhD with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) after graduation through the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. \"With the kind of leap ISRO is taking, the basics of space science should come down to primary level. Astronomy should be taken to schools. These days small kits and models are available for space-related things which could be introduced at the school level itself,\" Paranjpye said.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

While the teenager\u2019s father died on the spot, the boy suffered grievous head injuries and was later declared brain-dead. On June 14, the family members of the boy agreed to donate his vital organs.The recipient suffered from type 1 diabetes since childhood and his condition further deteriorated after he developed kidney failure a couple of years ago. \u201cAfter the transplant, the patient is recovering well and does not require insulin. His blood sugar level is within normal range and his kidney functions are also normalising,\u201d multi-organ transplant surgeon Vrishali Patil told TOI.Patil led the team of surgeons, including transplant experts Ninad Deshmukh and Bhagayashree Khaladkar, in performing the complicated surgery, which is common in western countries but rare in India. The recipient initially presented with cardiopulmonary failure and life-threatening fluctuating blood sugars not responding to medical management. Senior transplant nephrologist Atul Mulay treated him initially and worked him up to sustain the transplant surgery. This involved fine-tuning his dialysis and treating his complications.Elaborating on the complexities, Patil said, \u201cIt involved connecting a part of the small intestine and whole pancreas to major blood vessels on one side of the pelvis and then connecting the kidney to the blood vessels and urinary bladder on the opposite side.\u201d This required critical monitoring throughout and immediately after the surgery. Hospital\u2019s anaesthetist Sujit Saraf, intensivist Prasad Akole, gastroenterologist Sachin Palnitkar provided the medical care with Mulay during this period.\u201cFor someone like this young man with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes and complications like hypoglycemia (blood sugars less than 70), renal failure, cardiopulmonary failure, pancreas transplant is a life-saving operation.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

Of the 91 reservoirs the Central Water Commission (CWC) monitors, six in Maharashtra have reached the no live storage level. Sholayar dam in Tamil Nadu and Nagarjuna Sagar dam \u2014 straddling the border between Nalgonda District in Telangana and Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh \u2014 have also run out of live storage. Water can be discharged from reservoirs for use till they have live storage. According to the CWC data till June 13, the six state dams without live storage are Yeldari in Parbhani district, Ujjani in Solapur district, Jayakwadi in Aurangabad, Upper Tapi in Jalgaon, Pench in Nagpur and Isapur in Hingoli, Yavatmal, Nanded. Maharashtra is currently the only state after Andhra Pradesh that has recorded the highest plunge in its reservoir storage in comparison to the live capacity till now. A CWC official told TOI that no live storage in reservoirs means only dead water storage was available in them. \u201cThere are eight such reservoirs in the country among the 91 major reservoirs monitored by us. A majority of them are in Maharashtra. The drought-like situation last year in Maharashtra and delayed monsoon this time have caused water levels to dip considerably in dams, leaving only dead storage in some. Whatever little rainfall the state has been receiving has been in scattered locations, which has not helped in filling the dams,\u201d the official said. He said other states might be currently better off than Maharashtra because they might not be using dam water to that extent or received better rainfall. A water resource department official said the live storage in dams was taken for water planning throughout the year. \u201cThe dead storage is not considered in this planning but still, that water is available in dams and can be used if need be. A major demand and allocation of live storage water is for irrigation (75%), while 10-15% of it is allocated for industrial and domestic uses. For domestic usage, enough water is still available in the dead storage in dams,\u201d he said. On the maximum number of dams in Maharashtra reporting 0% live storage, the official said the state had more dams in comparison to others states and so the number of dams with only dead storage was more here.

Monsoon could be a couple of days away, but the day temperature has started dropping significantly in Pune and other parts of the state with its arrival being imminent.  The maximum temperature has dipped below 35\u00b0C in various places in Madhya Maharashtra. Shivajinagar recorded a pleasant 32.8\u00b0C on Tuesday.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, said, \u201cThe partly cloudy condition to mostly cloudy condition in parts of the city/district almost throughout the day have resulted in less heat load penetrating the city\u2019s soil surface. Also, rainfall in adjacent areas of Konkan and the presence of moist westerly wind over Pune has helped in keeping the day temperature low. Pre-monsoon rain in and around the city as well as the district has also added its bit in lowering the temperature.\u201d Kashyapi said all these conditions were indicating that monsoon was almost knocking at Pune\u2019s door and its onset was likely to happen in a couple of days.

Deputy director of education Minakshi Raut said the 19 colleges in Pune were shortlisted based on last year\u2019s cutoffs. \u201cColleges with more than 85% cutoff in the second merit list are among those that can increase the intake. We will scrutinize the applications for other willing institutions where there is a demand and grant them the hike,\" she said. Principals of some of the 19 colleges where FYJC seats will increase this year were unfazed by the state government\u2019s decision. They said it was in the right direction. Some heads of institutions said instead of increasing the overall intake, there should have been an extra division. It would have meant an increase of teachers and support staff, accordingly. Others said an increase of just 10 or 12 students per class will not affect the teaching-learning process in the class and the only difference will be during the practical sessions which needed sorting out. Most big colleges in the city have nearly 120 students per division and a total intake of around 720 in the science stream. A 10% hike would take the number to 72 more students. Smaller colleges like Laxmanrao Apte Prashala and Junior College with an intake capacity of 260 students would add 26 students. Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, prinicipal at Fergusson College, was optimistic. \u201cOur intake capacity is 720 seats in the science division and in the arts stream we have an intake capacity of 240. A 10% increase will mean an increase of 12 seats per division which can easily be managed. Moreover, the Deccan Education Society, our parent body, has agreed to provide teachers on contract in case we feel the need to increase the teacher strength per division,\u201d he said. Colleges hire teachers depending on the number of divisions. At Symbiosis College of Arts, Science and Commerce, the science section has 120 students per division and one teacher per subject. Principal Hrishikesh Soman said if the state is interested in increasing the intake, then colleges must be allowed to add divisions. \u201cWe already have 120 students per division. If they are going to add 10%, then it will be 12 students more per class. However, the number of teachers will remain the same. The infrastructure will also be a problem. The same teacher will now be saddled with more work. The government should allow additional divisions, teaching and support staff, \u201d Soman added. SP College principal Dilip Sheth said they already had over 1,500 students, but the added number of students would only affect the science stream. He said they could cope with the increase as they had the infrastructure and would recruit teachers on contract. \u201cWe have 720 seats in the aided and 120 in the unaided section for science stream which comprises six divisions and a non-grant section. In commerce, we have 480 seats and in arts the number is 240. A 10% increase will affect only the science sections as they have practicals. However, the number of additional seats is just 84 in the stream. We will spread out the 12 additional students per class and for practicals we will add a few more batches,\u201d he added. Rajendra Zunjarrao, Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce in Shivajinagar said more students would get into centrally located colleges because of the government\u2019s decision. The college has 600 seats in science, 600 in commerce and 360 in the arts stream. \u201cSome years ago, many junior colleges had sought permission to increase the seats but were told by the deputy director of education that the state government would decide.\u201d he said.

A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

The CCS team, which had been studying the Sahyadri ranges as part of a project since the past few years, said that these regions experienced rainfall between 25mm and 70mm in May. This year, the rainfall was zero, which has had an impact on fauna. For example, the members observed that insects mostly seen in the forest regions of Sahyadri ranges in May after the first showers were missing this year. The number of fireflies seen in the forest in May was distinctly low, but increased in the second week of June. Mitali Inamdar of CCAS said, \u201cThe large number of fireflies noticed at the end of May and also the insects seen after the first showers are now seen in the second week of June. This has impacted animals that depend on these insects for food,\u201d she said. Narrating a rare incident, Inamdar said, \u201cDuring our visit to Bhandardara, we saw a common krait snake eating a dead frog on the road. This snake commonly eats other snakes. However, due to unavailability of food or prey, the snake was forced to eat the dead frog.\u201d In the last two-three years, the CCS team had recorded an average rainfall of 60.7mm in Radhanagri, 69.8mm at Amba, 33.2mm at Bhorgiri, and 22mm in Bhandardara in May. The CCS members observed that it was once quite common to see frogs coming out at night before the monsoon, but now it has become rare. Even sounds of night insects were hard to come by. According to senior zoologist Hemant Ghate, \u201cPre-monsoon shower is important for the growth of insects. Due to these showers, water is available and also the temperature comes down. Some insects are seen when the right temperature sets in for them after the showers. There needs to be a detailed study on the relation between fireflies and monsoon.\u201d Sachin Punekar, biodiversity expert, said that many small and medium ponds and water reserves in Sahyadri have dried up due to lack of rains. Due to no rains in May, insects and frogs were unable to lay eggs. The little ones that come out of the eggs require large amount of food but due to lack of water, there was a major dearth of food. The situation has a cascading effect on the food cycle of insects and animals that are dependent on these insects.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "time": "2019-06-19 06:44:00", "datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lack-of-pre-monsoon-showers-affects-fauna/articleshow/69848636.cms"}, "Yogi Adityanath": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections-2019/uttar-pradesh/news/lok-sabha-elections-rahul-gandhi-scheme-for-poor-a-farce-says-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/68586697.cms", "description": "VARANASI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath slammed Congress president Rahul Gandhi for suddenly showing concern for the poor and asked why he didn\u2019t ensure a minimum income scheme for them during Congress-led UPA regime when his mother Sonia Gandhi acted as \u2018super prime minister\u2019 and had a say in everything.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Pune: 3 men rob courier firm employee of Rs 5L": {"description": "PUNE: Three men travelling in a car robbed a scooter-borne courier company employee of his bag containing Rs5 lakh beneath the Shankarsheth Road flyover near the busy Seven Loves Chowk around 4.30pm on Monday, police said. Complainant Pareshkumar Rameshbhai Kadiya (35) of Shukruwar Peth has been working with the Rameshkumar Kantilal Patel courier company for eight years and his job is to collect cash from clients and deposit it with the firm owner on a daily basis. The police said Kadiya had collected Rs5 lakh from a businessman in Market Yard around 4pm, packed it in a cloth bag and kept it in the storage space of his two-wheeler. The police added that he reached Seven Loves Chowk via Nishat talkies and was headed towards Swargate when the three men in a car overtook and intercepted him. Kadiya sought to know from the two men, who got down from the car, the reason for intercepting him. They, however, forced him to get down from the scooter and pushed him to an area under the flyover, the police said. One of the robbers then removed the ignition key of the scooter and opened its storage space. \u201cHis accomplice stole the bag containing the money,\u201d an officer said. A terrified Kadiya raised an alarm, but the passersby did not come to his rescue, the police quoted him as saying. \u201cHe remained silent after the robbers threatened to kill him and sped away with the money in the direction of Swargate,\u201d an officer said. He then contacted the owner of the company on the phone and alerted him that he was robbed of cash. The owner immediately reached the spot and took Kadiya to the Khadak police station for registering an FIR. But by then, two hours had passed since he was robbed. Personnel from the Khadak police and the crime branch (Unit I) visited the spot and launched investigation for arresting the robbers. Two robbers were detained. The police said a search was on to arrest the man who kept the money with himself. Khadak police assistant inspector Umaji Rathod said,\u201cThe robbery happened within five minutes. However, the courier firm owner spent quite a bit of time while questioning his employee. An FIR has been registered under sections 392 (robbery), 341 (wrongful confinement) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.\u201d He added, \u201cKadiya told police that he did not have the courage to physically resist the robbers.

Based on an increase in rainfall in parts of the state, officials at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) told TOI on Wednesday that the much-awaited rainy season could start in Pune and Mumbai on June 23. The onset dates of monsoon over Pune and Mumbai are June 10 and 11, respectively. There was no further progress of monsoon on Wednesday, but the Met department said conditions were becoming favourable for further advance of the southwest monsoon into some more parts of central Arabian Sea, Karnataka, some parts of south Konkan and Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, remaining parts of Tamil Nadu, some more parts of Bay of Bengal, remaining parts of northeast India, some parts of Gangetic West Bengal, Sikkim, parts of Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha during the next two or three days. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, said though the monsoon onset conditions over Mumbai seemed favourable for the past few days, something similar could not be said about Pune. \"The westerly wind flow, a characteristic of monsoon, has started in parts of the state but the amount, spread and intensity of rain in Maharashtra is less than required to declare the onset. Also, the onset criteria require fairly widespread to widespread rain as well as heavy rain in isolated places of a region, which is not happening currently but may be fulfilled around June 23 for both Mumbai and Pune, simultaneously,\" he said. Kashyapi said the conditions on June 19 and 20 might not seem favourable for the monsoon onset over parts of the areas adjacent to southern Maharashtra with mostly just overcast skies but poor rainfall. \"We see ideal conditions around June 21 for monsoon onset over south Konkan and Goa,\" he said. As far as Pune is concerned, Kashyapi said the city was likely to record light rain and have mostly cloudy skies till June 22. \"From June 22- 23, our forecast indicates increasing likelihood of light to moderate rain in spells in Pune. Hence, monsoon may make an onset over Pune around that time,\" he said. Kashyapi said monsoon was likely to make a simultaneous onset over Mumbai and Pune. Though Mumbai is fulfilling onset criteria to an extent, we cannot declare onset over south Konkan and Mumbai simultaneously because there is a huge aerial difference between the two. After the onset over south Konkan, monsoon is likely to take another two days to reach Mumbai,\" he said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

School education minister Ashish Shelar on Tuesday had said that the government had decided to increase the number of seats in popular junior colleges in Mumbai, Pune, and Nagpur based on the number of state board, ICSE and CBSE students applying for admissions. The schools and college heads said that arts and commerce faculties would not face issues while accommodating extra students in the classrooms due to availability of larger classrooms, but colleges with science stream will have to arrange for extra batches for practicals and hire teachers and lab technicians on a temporary basis. A M Shaikh, principal of Shri Mhalasakant Vidyalaya, Akurdi, said the trend last year was of most students opting for commerce which he thinks will continue this year too PB Buchade, principal of Abasaheb Garware College, also said that the move though beneficial for the students will become an inconvenience for the college managements. \u201cOne teacher has to hold the attention of 120 students at a time which is an impossible task. Now, we have seven divisions in the science stream and two divisions in the arts stream which means 108 additional students. We need more teachers for sure and additional batches for practical sessions. Hence, we may need to recruit teachers or lab assistants on contract basis once we see how the classes are going,\u201d he said. Rohini Patwardhan, principal MIT school and Junior College said that it is a challenge to accommodate additional students without lowering the quality and hence any college would need to employ additional staff. \u201cThe same number of students will be there for the next year too which is the crucial class XII. We have already seen a decrease in the marks in standard XII and this may not be the ideal solution to improve the condition. Most colleges that have compulsory attendance are not preferred by students because they prefer to go to colleges where attendance is given without checking so that these students can enroll in coaching classes. New colleges are given permission and there is vacancy in traditional colleges where rules are stricter. Everybody knows what is happening in most colleges but there is hardly any check on them and no action is taken resulting in bad results,\u201d Patwardhan said.

But the way it is being implemented will ultimately benefit nobody. The technicalities are still not sorted. Each division will have 12 more students in my college.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Only 2.17 lakh units have been constructed in the state against the target of 19 lakh affordable houses by 2020. This means more than 88% of the target is yet to be achieved. In 2018-19, the state government has constructed 1,892 units. In 2017-18 and 2016-17, it had built 55,695 and more than 1.6 lakh units respectively. The houses, meant for the economically weaker section, are constructed in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, in the PMR region in Pune and Shrirampur. \u201cThere was some delay in sanctioning of land last year. We will pick up the pace of construction now. We have recently launched a scheme at City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO),\u201d said housing officials, who plan to offer nearly 90,000 homes under the PMAY scheme. As per reports, in January this year, nearly 17,000 houses were approved for the urban poor by the urban development department. However, there was no deadline set. Unless adequate land is available for the project, completion will take time. Land availability is an issue especially in the big cities, said the the housing department official. The responsibility of land procurement is usually given to the Maharashtra Housing and Development Authority (MHADA), Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) and the local corporations. Under PMAY, the Centre provides assistance of Rs1lakh to Rs1.5lakh per dwelling, while the state contributes Rs1 lakh. The government allots the land at the rate of Re1 per sqmt with Rs1,000 charged as the stamp duty. The scheme has recently also involved developers under a PPP model. The state government has also waived the required security deposit for affordable housing meant for the economically weaker sections. There are other schemes like beneficiary-linked construction (BLC) and credit-linked subsidy scheme (CLSS) under which the state is trying to create affordable housing stock. Officials have, however, said there is also the issue of identifying genuine beneficiaries. Various agencies have been roped in to find the actual beneficiaries.

The Congress leader hit out at BJP's strategy of playing the nationalist card. \"We are Congress\u2026 we launched the freedom movement\u2026 gave our blood and sweat\u2026 braved British atrocities \u2026 we don't need any certificate to prove our nationalist feelings especially from the ones who apologised to the British at that time\", asserted Priyanka, urging the workers to go to every household in their area and meet every voter. She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022. And once we come, we will stay here for long on the basis of our hard work,\" she said adding that the hard-workers would be adequately rewarded.

Around 125 critical junctions would be covered in the initial stage of the project\u2019s implementation. The scope would be expanded to cover 261 junctions across the city in the next phases. The tender for the ATMS project was closed in March 2019. Two bids were received and evaluation of the pre-qualification criteria was underway.

The Regional Transport Authority (RTA) has given its nod to set up the stands at Pune railway station, Swargate and Shivajinagar state transport bus stands, and Sangam bridge. A senior officer of the Regional Transport Office (RTO) told TOI, \u201cThe project was under consideration for quite some time and the RTA has finally given the permission to start the prepaid autorickshaw booths. Primarily, the traffic wing of the Pune police will set up the stands. The RTO will assist them. The RTO has finalized the rate chart from different locations and given to the police. It will be the job of the police to provide space and infrastructure for these stands. The Pune RTO is working in close coordination with them.\u201d Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Pankaj Deshmukh said they had earlier thought of letting different autorickshaw unions do the job. \u201cThey were told to coordinate among themselves and start these stands. But there is a lot of infighting among them and the stands couldn\u2019t start. A non-government organization (NGO) registered with traffic branch was dormant for a long time. It has been revived and will look after the initiative. A vendor has been selected for the purpose and the space for the autorickshaw stands in the four areas has been finalized.\u201d He said the police were hoping that the booths would start in the next 10 days. \u201cThe spots were carefully chosen after studies. A lot of passengers look for autorickshaws at these spots. The new stands will be a relief for them,\u201d he said. The officer said was hopeful that the autorickshaw drivers would join the initiative and cater to passengers through the four booths. \u201cAt the end, they also want business. The infighting was about which union would start the booths. Now that the job has been taken care, they will use them,\u201d Deshmukh said. Hailing the move, Ravindra Gangwane, a frequent commuter, said, \u201cPMPML (Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited) cannot guarantee a proper service in terms of timings. Hence, many of us use autorickshaw regularly. A majority of the autorickshaw drivers refuse trips or ask for extra money.

Officials said that the road construction work began around 11pm on Tuesday and was completed about 11am on Wednesday. However, work on the 120-metre stretch of the road could only be completed as some farmers were yet to handover the land for the remaining portion comprising 30 metres. The road will be widened further as per the development plan (DP), once the remaining landowners along the side margins agreed to the compensation package, officials said. \"The civic body could not construct road on the 150-metre-long stretch of DP Road in Sawantnagar for the past 25 years as 30 to 35 landowners were not ready to give their land for road construction. On Tuesday, a majority of the land owners agreed to hand over their land. As a result, we have been able to get land for 120-metre stretch. We have tarred the 9-metre-wide contiguous portion of the road to enable vehicles cross the stretch quickly,\" an official said. Dighi village, located along Pune-Alandi Road, was merged within PCMC limits in 1997. Residents of Dighi have to travel through Bhosari to reach Pune-Nashik highway. But some of the roads that link Bhosari have not been properly developed due to land acquisition problems.

Another BJP corporator, Vikas Dolas, said, \u201cResidents living near the untarred road were facing respiratory ailments due to the dust blown up by vehicles passing through the open land during summer.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week.
