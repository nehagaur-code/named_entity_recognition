{"3 generations from Kalighat family serve armed forces": {"description": "KOLKATA: The Das family from Kalighat\u2019s Haldarpara is like any other Bengali family, except for one remarkable thing: three generations of this family have served in the country\u2019s armed forces. On June 8, as a proud Col Ashish Das (retd) put epaulets on the shoulders of his son (called \u2018pipping\u2019, in military parlance) after the passing-out parade at the Indian Military Academy at Dehra Dun, it was more than a dream come true. Accompanying him was his daughter, already an officer in the Army. The family can serve as an inspiration for the state that gradually earned the reputation of belonging to a \u2018non-martial\u2019 race. The colonel\u2019s children are the third generation to serve the country as soldiers. Their grandfather, Late Master Warrant Officer (MWO) B B Das, joined the Royal Indian Air Force and was based in Lahore in 1944 during World War II. He also fought the 1971 Indo-Pak War and went up to Jessore in what was then East Pakistan. He retired from the 253 Signals Unit in Barrackpore. Col Das graduated from St Xavier\u2019s College in Kolkata before joining the Assam Regiment in 1978. In a career spanning nearly 31 years, he was part of counter-insurgency operations across the country. He was also involved in peacekeeping operations with the Indian Peace Keeping Force at Jaffna in Sri Lanka. His exploits along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Arunachal Pradesh in 1986 prompted the Army to name a high-altitude post there \u2018Ashish Top\u2019. He served two tenures at Poonch in Jammu & Kashmir, once when militancy actually started there in 1988-\u201990. Das retired in 2009 and was appointed director of the Army\u2019s Placement Node in the eastern sector a couple of years later. He continued to head it till 2013. \u201cI have no regrets,\u201d Col Das said. \u201cMy daughter joined the Army as a legal officer in 2017 after graduating in law from Dehra Dun. My son is a technical graduate from Bengaluru but opted for an entry in the general stream (he could have opted for the technical stream). He is now an infantry officer in my own regiment. What more can I ask for? My son didn\u2019t even inform me of his plans till after clearing the written exam. He was worried that I would dissuade him as his sister is already in the Army. I can now concentrate on my golf,\u201d the veteran said.

The entire city has been dug out in the guise of laying underground drainage scheme and left without repair. How shocking it is to see 30 people dying of diarrhoea in a city like Guntur? Is it not the failure of the state government?

The threats followed within minutes of uploading her views last Sunday, condemning the enmity that spreads every time India face Pakistan in a cricket match. \u201cWithin minutes of me posting that I will remain as much a Shoaib Akhtar fan as a Yuvraj Singh one, comments started to pour in.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

The doctor-patient relationship, which forms the foundation of medical care, was affected the most in the week-long stand-off between the administration and junior doctors, protesting against the attack on their colleagues at NRS Medical College and Hospital and demanding safety for their fraternity. When services resumed on Tuesday, one of the biggest challenges for the medical professionals was to reclaim faith. Junior doctors and interns, who usually handle multiple patients at a go in emergency departments and don\u2019t have time even to look up, made it a point to smile and speak warmly with everyone visiting as they resumed work. Some doctors at OPDs, who could afford the luxury of having a chat owing to low turnout of patients, explained their predicament to the families. Many even expressed regret on how many patients had to return without receiving treatment. Some junior doctors explained the cease-work was neither planned nor rehearsed but manifested from their anguish. \u201cIt was painful when we could not treat people despite their repeated requests. It was not a pressure-building tactic, though it was perceived as one. We received support from several patients and their families but it is natural for them to get agitated when denied treatment. We tried to explain to some patients that our movement was to safeguard the medical fraternity so that we can serve you better,\u201d said Jayanta Sinha, an intern at Medical College and Hospital. After OPDs reopened and emergency wards returned to normality, the surge in the number of patients was not as high as on other days. The reason, doctors said, was probably because people from districts, who formed a bulk of government hospital patient count, were not sure whether services had resumed properly or not. But those who did land up, many from far-flung villages, were surprised to find doctors attending to all, smiling and even striking up a conversation. Families that frequent government hospitals are aware of the rush and that doctors don\u2019t get any time to speak to anybody. \u201cBut I was surprised today. They were so cordial and polite. I am unwell and have problem in moving. They assured me I would be fine if I followed the medication properly and helped me move as well. These interactions and word of assurance are important in improving the doctor-patient ties,\u201d said Shamsur Mullick (50), who visited SSKM Hospital from Basirhat. At Medical College and Hospital, several patients narrated how doctors at OPD asked after them and expressed regret that they had to wait for treatment for so long. \u201cI visit the nephrology OPD often and no doctor has ever spoken to me about anything but my ailment. But today, daktar babu asked me how I was doing and said it was bad that so many people had to go without treatment for a week. He explained what they did was to protect their fraternity, which was under attack from all quarters, and was creating hindrance to work,\u201d said said Sabir Mondal, a patient from Howrah. During their agitation, the junior doctors reiterated they wanted to serve patients but the frequent attacks had pushed them against the wall. \u201cA perception was created that instead of serving the ill, we were sitting on a dharna to protect ourselves.

It will be a keenly fought battle between Tamilisai and DMK\u2019s state women wing secretary and Rajya Sabha MP K Kanimozhi in Tuticorin. Though Tamilisai initially preferred to contest from Chennai South, which has a sizeable votebank for the party, she finally settled for Tuticorin.

The autumn-winter collection that the designers showcased in Kolkata on Sunday, set new benchmarks in men\u2019s couture wear. An ode to the past: The collection, \u2018The Prince Unknown\u2019, took inspiration from the bygone era, but the balance of contemporary and traditional was well achieved in the designs that were all about structured silhouettes, drapes and layers. Says Shantanu, \u201cWe have always been inspired by the pre-Independence era. Through this collection, we revisited the palaces and had an insight into the lives of royalty. The princes and kings had a charming appeal and were known for their unique and classic style. They were fearless, indulgent and knew what luxury is. We wanted to show that prince and rulers in the past had a life which pretty much had the motto of work hard, party harder. So the fearless attitude is reflected in the structured silhouettes. There was also a bit of feminine touch through the drapes and layered effect. We used a lot of raw silk, jerseys to create that fall and effect in drapes and layers in kurtas.\u201d Of Nehru jackets and waistcoats: From rich tones like royal blue and maroon to subtle shades like beiges, brown and grey, the collection presented a mix of shades. Muted embroidery on jackets, texturing and fine detailing were noteworthy. Layered kurtas, bandhgalas, sherwanis with churidaars were part of the collection. The designers paid a lot of attention to jackets. \u201cThis time the emphasis is on our love for Nehru collars. Nehru collar was given different shapes, some rather high and some were kept in their natural form \u2013 something that we are used to seeing. Then there were variations in jacket lengths. There were cropped jackets, waist coats, bandhgalas and sherwanis with lengths kissing your knee and with high slits so that one can see the drama at the bottom. It was a jacket-focused collection and textures were very tone-on-tone. There was a hint of understated luxury throughout the collection,\u201d says Shantanu.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Preliminary investigation has revealed that Mallick allegedly raped the 11-year-old between 6pm and 8pm on Saturday when her parents had gone to the market.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing. Living with the dead: A grave in the backyard\"All we are asking for is some land for our ancestors. There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar. Their burial grounds are filled to capacity,\" said Nizam Khan, a mechanic. Village pradhan Sundar Kumar said that he had asked officials several times for a burial ground for Muslim families, but no action was taken. Ravi Kumar NG, the district magistrate, said that he was not aware of the issue. \"I will send an official team to the village and get details of the burial land required.\" Picture Credit: Hemant Kumar In Video:Houses turn into graveyards as Muslims in this UP village bury the dead at homeDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Unauthorized bike stand beside Barasat station": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/unauthorizedbikestandbesidebarasatstation/articleshow/69510995.cms", "description": ""}, "Ashton Kutcher": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/hollywood/news/ashton-kutcher-and-mila-kunis-trash-split-rumours-in-the-funniest-way-possible/articleshow/69868560.cms", "description": ""}, "Irrepairable loss, Exide Crossing": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/irrepairableloss2cexidecrossing/articleshow/69818289.cms", "description": ""}, "RCB team 2019": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rcb-team-2019-players-list-royal-challengers-bangalore-team-2019/articleshow/67151637.cms", "description": ""}, "World Cup: Pakistani man misbehaves with Saif Ali Khan at stadium": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//videos/entertainment/hindi/world-cup-pakistani-man-tries-to-misbehave-with-saif-ali-khan-fans-back-on-social-media/videoshow/69859837.cms", "description": ""}, "Bikers shoot at BJP man as Bhatpara still on boil": {"description": "Bhatpara: A 22-year-old college student was shot at on Wednesday morning at Bhatpara, North 24 Parganas, as post-election violence continued between Trinamool Congress and BJP. Suraj Mondal, a BJP activist, was standing in front of a petrol pump when bike-bo-rne miscreants fired at him. State armed police and CRPF jawans were barely 60m away at the police outpo-st. Suraj is in critical condition at Kalyani Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital. Locals said the incident occurred around 8.40am, when Suraj was chatting in front of a tea stall. \u201cThree youths in their early 30s, with helmets covering their faces, came on a motorbike that stopped in front of the tea stall. One of the pillion riders fired at Suraj at point-blank range. The bikers then fled. We rushed out and saw Suraj fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. His father Jallu is our colleague,\u201d said Bhatpara Reliance jute mill employee Bapi Mishra. Suraj was taken to Bhatpara State General Hospital and shifted to JNM hospital. He is a BA second-year student of Naihati RBC College. The incident raised questions about security in Bhatpara and Kankinara, which have been worst-hit in BJP-TMC violence. \u201cOnly 4-5 buildings separate the tea stall and the police outpost, which is always packed with adequate personnel, including RAF and central force jawans.

Muslims from various walks of life, who have been living in Kolkata for decades, highlighted two recent incidents: the NRS Medical College and Hospital violence last Monday and the hounding of model Ushoshi Sengupta and her app cab driver in the city this Monday. The accused, in both cases, were arrested within 24 hours of the incidents. \u201cThe attackers in both instances were members of our community. We are grieved and embarrassed. Bring the assailants to book not just in these two instances but in every single instance where Muslims are involved. They should not be allowed to get away because they happen to be Muslims (as is the growing perception). This will send out a message that members of one community are not being shielded or appeased (as most people bel-ieve),\u201d the letter \u2014 signed by 46 prominent Muslim citizens of Kolkata \u2014 states. They have also urged the state government to engage or encourage engagements with Muslim youth and their families across Kolkata in gender-sensitisation, civic consciousness and law-compliance. \u201cThis requires long-term patience but needs to be implemented right away,\u201d the letter says. Psychologist Zahid H Ganjee, one of the signatories, said: \u201cThere have been several lynching cases in the past year-and-a-half and sane voices from the Hindu community have demanded justice. Unfortunately, Muslims have not said and done enough when members of the community have acted like rogues. This has led to the entire community being tarnished. I hope the letter will spark a conversation, even a debate and then something good will come out of it. We are losing our primary identity as a citizen of this country and state. We need to reclaim it.\u201d Abdul Rahim, who runs an NGO, stressed the need for the community to receive fair and not privileged treatment. \u201cThere is a growing perception that the administration here is soft on Muslims who break the law. This perception needs to change. We want the law to be enforced without considering religious identity,\u201d he said. Communications expert Mudar Patherya, who drafted the letter after a discussion with several of the signatories, said there had been simmering discontent for some time. \u201cI will not comment on whether the perception (that the administration is soft on Muslims) is right or wrong. But I feel, till now, governments have looked at the next vote and not the next generation. The moment they do that, things will change positively. I believe Muslims need to take a position,\u201d he said. Rahim says the administration needs to reach out to the community in the ghettos and strengthen, educate and empower the youth. \u201cIf you consider each of the incidents, the culprits hailed from ghettos,\u201d he said. Most of the signatories feel the recurring crime by Muslim youths is to do with poverty and illiteracy in ghettos where they reside. Mamoon Akhtar, who runs a school (Samaritan Help Mission) in Tikiapara, says children can bring about great change if educated. But the letter has also drawn flak from a section of the community. Nutritionist Neha Hafiz, another signatory, took pains to point out that it was not a missive against the Trinamool government or its treatment of Muslims; but there was a need to change the perception that was being created about the community receiving more privileges than others. \u201cThere is a problem. We cannot deny it. And it needs to be addressed. Blaming anyone does not help. There is a need for education and reforms,\u201d she said.

Police have also announced a host of measures \u2014 including late-night naka checks across the city and issuing a standard operating procedure (SOP) on how to deal with a complainant on the street \u2014 to ensure a repeat of similar incident does not happen. The departmental inquiry initiated in this case \u2014 led by DC (south) Meeraj Khalid \u2014 has established that prima facie, sub-inspector Piyush Kumar Bal of the Charu Market police station had told Sengupta to approach the Bhowanipore police to lodge her case. Similarly, assistant sub-inspector Partha Chatterjee (who responded to the desperate calls of the model but allegedly told her the area where she raised the alarm came under Bhowanipore police station) and sub-inspector Milan Majumdar of Bhowanipore police (who felt there was no incident to bear out a case at Exide Crossing even when Sengupta and the driver were being harassed) have been show-caused. The police brass has decided to create an SOP that will deal with complainants seeking help on the road or those approaching a police station under which the crime did not take place. \u201cThe cop who responds first will ensure the case gets reported at the police station concerned. The reaction time will be monitored,\u201d said a police officer. In another major decision announced by additional CP Jawed Shamim, local police will work in tandem with traffic police to carry out night nakas at different locations. \u201cThe surprise element has to be maintained. We are expecting to carry out these nakas between 10pm and 1.30am,\u201d said an officer. Police are at a final stage of implementing sensor cameras that can trigger alarms at the control room if something grossly wrong is detected.

On Wednesday, Joyel Murmu, the MLA from Malda\u2019s Habibpur newly elected in an assembly bypoll, chanted \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019 at the end of his oath-taking, following in the footsteps of Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh who chanted the same in Parliament. Assembly Speaker Biman Banerjee directed that the chant be removed from the record of assembly proceedings. \u201cThe framers of the Constitution had given a thought to such a situation and prescribed a format of oath-taking which is part of the Constitution. No one should digress from the format,\u201d Banerjee said. Article 188 of the Constitution provides that members should take oath before participating in the proceedings of a legislature. The format is laid down in the Third Schedule. \u201cThe format asks members to take oath either in the name of God or solemnly affirm by the Constitution. A member can\u2019t add or delete a word in the format. S/he must stick to the format,\u201d Banerjee said. The seven other new members \u2014 including BJP MLAs such as Neeraj Tamang Zimba from Darjeeling \u2014 stuck to the format. \u201cI am appalled with the way members from BJP and Trinamool Congress flouted the Constitution with impunity in Parliament. The BJP member did a replay without even knowing that he was going against the Constitution,\u201d said Abdul Mannan, leader of the opposition in West Bengal assembly . Eight members were elected in the assembly bypolls held along with the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Bhatpara, Darjeeling, Habibpur, Islampur, Kandi, Krishnaganj, Nowda, and Uluberia Purba. Bypolls were announced following the demise of the Krishnaganj MLA and the vacancy of the other seven seats after their MLAs contested Lok Sabha polls. Going by the trend, chief minister Mamata Banerjee may have to hear more such chants when the assembly holds its monsoon session. Learning the hard way from the Bhatpara incident when she had stopped her car and berated those chanting \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019, Banerjee is no longer reacting to it.

A section of students said that they were preparing for a viva that was scheduled for 9am. Around 2:30am, they heard loud noises \u2014 coming mainly from rooms 9 and 11. When the students requested the occupants of the rooms to keep the noise down, it escalated into a heated argument. Within the next 20 minutes, a fight ensued. A boarder, Subhra Pratim Banik, was alerted by the commotion and proceeded to check out the matter and found the students fighting. Banik and a few others attempted to intervene when they discovered that two of the youths involved were friends of the occupants of the two rooms and not students of Jadavpur University.

Images of a gang of unruly bikers following her app cab, beating up the driver and vandalising the car were splashed all over. The City Of Joy has now started scaring people with its ugly face, especially for those who work around erratic schedules and return home late. It\u2019s time to take stock of the grave situation. Models in the city share their concerns for themselves and people in professions that demand them to work in late-night shifts. \u2018it\u2019s not just about women\u2019s safety\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s not only women\u2019s safety that I am concerned about. I stood up for the app cab driver. Anybody can face such a situation and need help. So, the police should be prompt. When I approached the police station, I was not told about the Zero FIR facility. I may not be aware but they should have helped me with the information. In such cases, you can lodge a complaint at any police station even if it doesn\u2019t fall under the crime scenario area. I had a friend with me who is a member of the LGBTQIA+ community and he was so scared. After my post went viral, top cops have come forward to help. But this should be the case for everyone. The question remains how come such hooligans are allowed to ride bikes without helmets, scaring people off in the wee hours?\u2019 \u2014 Ushoshi Sengupta\u2018Over the years, I have been commuting back home in groups during the wee hours. But earlier, the safety scene was a little better than now. When I worked some seven years back, I didn\u2019t have the fear of being attacked playing in the back of my mind. Back then, it would still be safe for a woman to be out alone at midnight. But today, it\u2019s really scary for us. Whenever I am driving, I am haunted by this fear of being stopped by rowdy bikers. This is not just a concern for women in the entertainment world. Regular jobbers and young girls out for enjoying a late-night movie or dinner face the same fear. Why can\u2019t they roam around freely?\u2019 \u2014 Jessica Gomes\u2018It\u2019s unthinkable that no one came to help Ushoshi that day. The law and order in the state has been questionable for a long while now. It\u2019s clearly deteriorating day by day. It\u2019s not just about the women but also about people like the app cab drivers, who work late night. They don\u2019t have any strings to pull. It\u2019s great that social media users have come forward to help the cause. If I ever go through such a situation, the first thing that will come to my mind is that I will have to go to the nearest police station for lodging an FIR. But if I don\u2019t receive help, it will be difficult. In the dead of the night, how can the police tell a woman that it should not be this police station but some other? I don\u2019t know where we are heading. I have also faced such negligence but in other cases like losing a phone. We do have random schedules and timings. We can\u2019t help it. Earlier when my dad would want to assist me to work, I would say I can manage. Now, I really think twice. Such cases are not one-offs anymore. I also have to be very careful about what I wear while returning late in the night. It\u2019s scary and annoying at the same time. Kolkata is losing its basic sense of humanity\u2019 \u2014 Diti Saha\u2018I have been working since 2016 and have been in constant fear while returning late in the night. With God\u2019s grace, I have not faced such scary scenarios till now. But I do feel insecure and scared at times. I stay really far away from south Kolkata, where most of my assignments take place. I have to return all the way to Sodepur at night. I completely rely on app cabs. I do send my commuting details to my family to take precaution. But this is all that I can do. I have heard from my senior colleagues that the city used to be safer earlier. Ushoshidi is working since long but the incident happened now. So, we can well imagine. Our safety in the city has become a question mark nowadays\u2019 \u2014 Ria Bhattacherjee\u2018I started modelling 13 years back. The question of safety was there at that time too. But I never faced such fearful events. In our profession, late night is not new but if this is what women have to face then it\u2019s unfortunate. Hats off to Ushoshi! The girl fought against so many unruly men. In our time, all these used to happen in the dark lanes but now it is happening on the main road. That\u2019s really sad. If such situations continue then I really don\u2019t know what will happen. Not only models but there are women from other professions too who work late. So, what is the solution? Should women stop working then? It will help if the police are prompt in lodging the FIR wherever women approach them first.

KMC is already planning a crackdown on unscrupulous units. More than 100 residents of Vidyasagar Colony, Baghajatin and Ramgarh tested positive for Hepatitis A \u2014 which spreads from infected food or water \u2014 in less than a fortnight, as reported by TOI on May 31. Times ViewNow that the KMC has evidence, it should act against all unscrupulous bottlers who may be putting the citizen\u2019s health at risk. The action needs to be in the form of a sustained campaign.Now, the test results from the KMC laboratory, confirming the presence of the bacteria, have triggered alarm bells far beyond these areas. With packaged drinking water being widely distributed and consumed across the city, there are fears of more cases emerging from other areas. Physician Sanjay Dasgupta, who is treating more than 50 Hepatitis A patients from these localities, said several packaged water brands had cropped up locally, which sell contaminated water. \u201cI am convinced that packaged drinking water has been a major source of contamination,\u201d he said. \u201cApart from poor quality of production, most city-based manufacturers and traders also ignore the hygiene factor, which leads to health hazards and may cause stomach-related diseases like colitis and jaundice,\u201d said physician Sanjay Dasgupta. Coliform bacteria are organisms that are present in the environment and in the faeces of all warm-blooded animals and humans. These bacteria will not likely cause illness, but their presence in drinking water indicates the presence of disease-causing organisms (pathogens) in the water system. Most pathogens that can contaminate water supplies come from the faeces of humans or animals. Since testing drinking water for all possible pathogens is complex, time-consuming and expensive, a relatively easy and less expensive test is done for coliform bacteria to rule whether the water is safe to drink. Deputy mayor Atin Ghosh, who also looks after KMC\u2019s health department, has directly blamed units selling spurious packaged drinking water for the spread of enteric diseases in Kolkata and called for a crackdown, with help from the enforcement department. \u201cWe need to get rid of unscrupulous traders dealing in packaged drinking water. Going by laboratory tests, we have reasons to worry about the samples of packaged drinking water collected from the affected areas,\u201d Ghosh said. Last year, too, during an outbreak in the Jadavpur-Baghajatin belt that claimed two lives and sent hundreds to hospital, fingers had been pointed at suspect packaged drinking water units. Whereas contamination in civic taps or pipelines is easier to detect and control, the spread of illness can become much wider if the contamination source is spurious packed water, as it is distributed in PET bottles and jars. Last May, following the outbreak, KMC\u2019s water department had collected 20-litre packaged water jars from several vendors and dealers in the affected localities. There is another reason for concern. Debasish Mukherjee, the RSP councillor in the affected belt, said: \u201cUnlike water supplied by KMC, which is filtered or boiled before consumption in various households, contaminated packaged drinking water is dangerous because people presume it is safe and consume it directly.\u201d A KMC laboratory analysis of water samples from several packaged water bottles and jars, as well as civic taps in the affected belt, found presence of coliform bacteria in large numbers. This is the second time that water from these localities has been found contaminated. In the days following the initial reports of the Hepatitis A outbreak, around 14 water samples were collected, of which 12 were found to contain coliform bacteria.

But for women, returning home from office in the middle of the night is a different ball game altogether. Monday night\u2019s incident of a model being harassed in the dead of the night has reinforced my fears. The moment a hooligan gang spots me in the car \u2014 there is a security guard with me \u2014 they start singing or screaming and try to get close to the car. This is scary. What if they harm me? What if they stop the car and drag me out? How will I save myself? Who can I approach for help? My nervous mind stops working. I feel vulnerable. I remember a couple of such incidents. In the first, my car was waiting at the signal at Esplanade when two bikes stopped beside it. The men kept staring at me while singing some cheap numbers as long as I waited at the signal. I was petrified. I moved to the middle of the rear seat, rolled up the car windows and prayed for a safe ride. But till date, I can\u2019t forget how insecure I felt that night. Another incident I remember was during a festival. My car was stuck at Anwar Shah Road and the road was chock-a-block with revellers. I was seated behind the driver. A little scared, I was about to pull up the window when a guy stuck his head in. His face was right in front of me. Shuddering in fear, I hurried to the other side of the car. Similar incidents have happened multiple times, and its worse during festivals when road romeos become more daring. I feel lucky to be safe. But what about the panic and helplessness I have to encounter? Every time I face such an incident, the first thing I look for is the nearest police station. I also try to remember if any of my friends or colleagues lives nearby so that I can call for help. What if the traffic cop on duty doesn\u2019t help me? What will be the last resort? Jumping out of the car and running for my life? It makes me angry that women have to face such experiences every other night. Why must we go through all this? Why can\u2019t I feel safe while driving back home at night? Why can\u2019t I enjoy the rain on my way back, not bothering about how many bikes or cars are there on the road?

It was triggered by a low pressure and a cyclonic circulation and could be followed by more rain on Thursday. Monsoon could hit south Bengal on Friday, said the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). Kolkata recorded a maximum temperature of 37.6\u00b0C on Wednesday. Wednesday\u2019s thunderstorm was accompanied by gusty winds that reached a maximum speed of 48kmph. But it didn\u2019t last a minute to qualify as a squall. The day temperature is set to drop on Thursday and the city could remain cloudy. \u201cLow pressure over north Bay of Bengal and a cyclonic circulation that has formed near Jharkhand have started generating clouds. These could float into Kolkata and lead to moderate rain on Thursday. More showers are expected as the low pressure intensifies and we expect monsoon to set in by Friday,\u201d said RMC director GK Das. On Wednesday, several south Bengal districts, including Midnapore, Jhargram, Hooghly and Burdwan, received heavy showers. Weathermen said the rain could gradually intensify across the rest of south Bengal over the next two-three days. \u201cSince the relevant currents have started reviving, we expect the showers to pave the way for monsoon,\u201d Das added. Cyclone Vayu that hit the Gujarat coast earlier this month had stalled the monsoon currents. The Bay branch of the monsoon, which hits south Bengal by the second week of June, was affected. Instead of June 1, which was the scheduled date for its arrival in Kerala, monsoon reached the southern Bengal on June 8. The monsoon arms, including the Bay branch, remained inactive till Vayu passed by. The delay in the onset of monsoon left south Bengal hot and humid.

Similarly, the journey from Mumbai to Delhi could be completed in just 10 hours. The railways has set the target to increase the maximum speed of trains on these routes to 160 kmph to cut down the travel time between the national capital and financial capital by five hours and save five-and-half-hours\u2019 journey time between Delhi and Kolkata. The fastest trains now (Rajdhani) can run at a maximum speed of 130 kmph. This is among the clutch of proposals that the railways has finalised as a part of its 100-day agenda under the second edition of the Narendra Modi government. The railways estimates spending of about Rs 13,500 crore in shoring up the national transporter\u2019s infrastructure over the next four years. According to a circular issued by Railway Board chairman V K Yadav, enhancing track infrastructure on these two busy routes is necessary as they account for nearly 30% of passenger and 20% of total freight traffic on the rail network. Yadav has instructed officials to initiate immediate action to start implementing the plans by August 31 and the ministry has sent the proposals to the PMO. Sources said Yadav on Wednesday shared the details of the targets including the plan to bring in private players to run passenger trains on select routes at a meeting of Group of Secretaries on infrastructure. TOI on Wednesday reported the move by railways to open up the passenger segment for private entities and the plan to launch a mega campaign to pursue people to \u201cgive up\u201d the concessions that they can avail while buying tickets. The railways has also proposed to obtain all approvals in the next 100 days to eliminate 2,568 level crossings on Golden Quadrilateral and diagonals with rail over bridges and rail under bridges. It has estimated spending of about Rs 50,000 crore in the next four years for this and the entire funding will come from Centre. This will be level two government intervention to do away with level crossing. Earlier, the government had eliminated \u201cunmanned level crossings\u201d either with ROBs/ RUBs or by deploying people after installing gates. Constructing of ROBs and RUBs will ensure seamless traffic movement across the tracks. Other targets include obtaining Cabinet approval for a digital corridor for railways with provision of 10 MHz spectrum in 700 MHz frequency band for railways which will enable it to increase trains\u2019 carrying capacity due to increase speed potential, improve operation during fogs and improved security. Other proposals include providing Wi-Fi at all 6,485 railway stations, starting a pilot for an advanced signalling system, jump-starting process redevelopment of 50 railway stations and restructuring of the Railway Board.

Taking a leaf out of the controversies over a few recent inductions, including Labhpur legislator Monirul Islam, BJP has decided to first scrutinise their background. PM Narendra Modi has also started following Twitter handles of general secretary-level state leaders. In his tweet on Wednesday, BJP Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya pointed to enhanced responsibility.

But that might also lead to indiscriminate recruitment, which will hurt the party in the long run,\u201d said a state BJP leader. While there will be no bar on primary membership, elevation to active membership will require scrutiny. \u201cA primary member is eligible to be an active member after two years. But that does not automatically transform into active member status. Only an active member is eligible to hold posts in the organisation,\u201d said Sayantan Basu, state general secretary.

The players participating in the Satta Matka game/ gambling are required to choose the right number for winning the game. The player who wins the game becomes Satta King and is rewarded financially. Two of the most famous Matka games are - Kalyan and Worli. The Kalyan Matka gambling was started by Kalyanji Bhagat, a farmer from Gujarat, in 1962 and it ran for all days of the week. Another Matka gambling, New Worli Matka, was started by the Rattan Khatri in 1964 with slight modifications to the rules of the game. Khatri\u2019s Matka ran only five days a week, from Monday to Friday.The modern Matka business is centred around Maharashtra.Some of the terms used in the game and their meaning is given below:    Term Meaning   Matka Matka means earthen pot that were used to draw numbers   Single Any digit between 0 and 9   Jodi/Pair Any pair of two digits between 00 and 99    Patti/Panna Three digit number    Open result / close result Outcome of matka betting   Berij Berij is last digit of jodi's/pair's sum The Google 2018 trends data shows that 'satta' and 'matka' were the top searched words in the Madhya Pradesh state in the year 2018.

Chowdhury now has to do tightrope walking in Parliament in a bid to take along all opposition parties, including Trinamool, against the BJP-led NDA government under the strict supervision of Congress seniors Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. According to senior parliamentarians, Chowdhury will have to focus on opposition consensus on the House floor that won\u2019t always match with the anti-BJP, anti-Trinamool mandate he got from Behrampore. Chowdhury began his day in Parliament on Wednesday with the innocuous \u201ckochuri and khichri\u201d speech while giving thanks to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, leaving his admirers hoping that he might regain his punch in future. Leader of opposition in West Bengal assembly Abdul Mannan, however, believes Chowdhury will be able to turn this apparent disadvantage into an advantage for Congress in the state. \u201cAdhir is a mass leader after ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury and Priya Ranjan Dasmunshi. People trust him. He is also aware of the tough task ahead, which is why he had proposed Rahul Gandhi\u2019s name as CLP leader. But I am happy Congress high command has reposed faith in him. It has come as a moral boost to Congress workers in Bengal when Trinamool is facing desertions,\u201d Mannan said. Chowdhury\u2019s elevation in Congress, nine months after his removal as West Bengal Pradesh Congress president in September 2018, reaffirms the party\u2019s confidence in him despite his access to the PM and his proximity to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. His loyalist and Congress deputy leader in Bengal assembly, Manoj Chakrabarty, believes that the new feather in Chowdhury\u2019s cap will help the party\u2019s rejuvenation, particularly in Murshidabad where the ruling Trinamool had taken control of civic bodies through poaching Congress MLAs and councillors. But how far Chowdhury can assert himself in going the whole hog against Trinamool is the question. Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee has excellent rapport with Sonia, who will be calling the shots inside and outside Parliament. Asked if such an arrangement would compromise Chowdhury\u2019s stance against Trinamool, Chakrabarty said: \u201cI think Adhir-da can tide over the problem, given his stature, when the party high command has recognised his contribution. He has got a pat on the back from the PM as well.\u201d State Congress president Somen Mitra is happy with the way the party high command has given importance to Bengal. \u201cPranab Mukherjee was the leader of the House when the party was in power. Adhir has been made the leader when the party is in opposition. It shows Congress seniors are banking on Bengal,\u201d Mitra said. The PCC president, however, saw no difficulty in Chowdhury doing floor coordination with opposition parties inside Parliament and pursuing the party line outside. \u201cChowdhury implemented the party line. Our party\u2019s stance against BJP and Trinamool hasn\u2019t changed. I believe people in Bengal are mature enough to distinguish between the party\u2019s floor coordination and its political strategy. We are still open to building movements with the Left in Bengal,\u201d Mitra said.

Anil Mukherjee, COO of Tolly Club, Suchitra Guha, former Tata Steel HR head, Gerry Arathoon, chief of the Council of Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) and Anjali Das, principal of United Missionary School, are the four members who have written to the Bishop, voicing their dissent. Bishop reinstates ex-secretary of La Martiniere SchoolsThe letters state that Calvert was appointed by the consent of all the members of the La Martiniere Board and his removal is against the constitution of the school. The letter by Mukherjee (in possession of TOI) states that it is not the Bishop, but the high court, that is the guardian of the school and the Bishop, by dint of being an ex-officio member, cannot take unilateral decisions. \u201cNo reason has been cited for his removal.

Normality returning to government hospitals made the family of the deceased feel less guilty for something they never wanted to happen. But a sense of fear hung heavy in the air as the youngsters seemed scared of another round of police action, after five from the area were picked up for assault on doctors.  \u201cAllah insaaf karega. Par logon ki pareshaani kam hui (Allah will do justice. But people are now spared the trouble),\u201d said Shamma Khatun, daughter of the deceased, Md Syed (75). \u201cWe could not even mourn our father properly as the situation went out of control. Worse was the suffering of thousands of people, including many from our locality, who could not get treatment at government hospitals. That pained us the most. None of them in this locality has the means to get treatment at private nursing homes.\u201d Peering out of a small room in the congested lane, Khatun tried to hide her tears. \u201cMy younger brother, Md Shabir, is yet to get over the shock of losing our father. He leaves home early in the morning and roams around aimlessly. At times, his friends find him weeping beside our father\u2019s grave,\u201d she said. \u201cNone in the locality blamed us for what followed, but we feel it should not have happened.\u201d Her elder brother, Md Israel, a maulana at a nearby mosque, sat inside a room, talking over phone. \u201cWe can pray for those who are in pain. What else can we do?\u201d she said. As Khatun spoke, a few neighbours gathered around. They recounted the harassment people from the neighbourhood had to go through, seeking treatment in the past week. Md Shauqat\u2019s daughter-in-law was in an advanced stage of pregnancy and was under the treatment of a doctor at NRS Hospital. \u201cBut they refused her admission. Turned away by NRS, we took her to CNMCH but even there, the doctors were on strike,\u201d Shauqat recounted. After much coaxing, the woman was admitted to CNMCH, where she delivered a baby the next day. \u201cThe doctors were good to us and there is nothing we can complain about. But we had to pursue them a lot to get her admitted,\u201d Shauqat said. A group of men, who had just returned from the funeral services of a neighbour, sat quietly. The youngsters in the neighbourhood are apprehensive of police action. \u201cSome of the youths went live on Facebook after the rampage. They are scared that they would be identified. We fear another action by the cops after the dust settles down,\u201d a local said.

The nodal officers from Swathya Bhawan will work in tandem with the hospital administrations and the police to implement security measures at these state-run hospitals. Apart from security aspect, the nodal officers will also look after other issues, particularly that of infrastructure, pertaining to respective hospitals. Apart from the five medical colleges and hospitals of the city, the other teaching hospitals in the districts, too, have been given nodal officers from Swasthya Bhawan. While the police will look into the access control at all gates, no illegal parking will be allowed near the hospitals. Swasthya Bhawan, the state health headquarters, on Wednesday also issued an order, giving the medical superintendent-and-vice principal (MSVP) at each hospital the authority to lodge a police complaint in case of vandalism or assault on doctors. A report also has to be sent to the state health department. Two days after chief minister Mamata Banerjee assured junior doctors of effective security measures, state health secretary Rajiva Sinha on Wednesday presided over a meeting with the newly appointed nodal officers, principals and MSVPs of the five government medical colleges in the city and the police nodal officer, DCP (Combat) Colonel Nevendera Singh Paul. Paul\u2019s combat force will train the security personnel at the hospitals on how to tackle mobs. Confirming the meeting, Sinha said, \u201cThe suggestions made at the CM meet were followed up during the meeting on Wednesday.\u201d A joint team from the health department and Kolkata Police will start visiting hospitals for security audit from Monday. The team is expected to find out security loopholes at the establishments, such as lapse in access control, and look for room for improvement by checking if more space can be created in the emergency wards, better security can be implemented, more CCTV cameras can installed and if there is a need for augmentation in the existing private security services. Once the audit is completed, the joint team will put in its recommendations. The ground work for the security audit will start from Thursday. \u201cAccording to the recommendations by the security audit team, an SOP will be prepared and recommended,\u201d a senior officer, who was in the meeting, said. According to the police top brass at Lalbazar, officers have decided to start mapping zones and past incidents to pinpoint certain areas and similar incidents that had led to assaults on doctors in the past. In addition, now that the CCTV footages will be available with the local DCP office, outpost and the local police station, senior officers will use a special app to track the grabs. Police sources said that they would also store the CCTV images from the emergency wards for longer in case they needed to be investigated. In addition, local police will work with the Special Branch, the Anti-Rowdy Squad and the local police stations to assess the local groups or patients\u2019 families that can pose danger. \u201cWe are trying to create a separate portal and a unique email ID, where both doctors and patients can raise their respective security issues.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Babughat Bathing ghat": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/babughatbathingghat/articleshow/69718343.cms", "description": ""}, "Shibani Dandekar's most sizzling pictures": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/shibani-dandekar-sizzling-pics/shibani-dandekars-most-sizzling-pictures/photostory/65770159.cms", "description": ""}, "Pollution unabated, Bagjola": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/pollutionunabated2cbagjola/articleshow/69718319.cms", "description": ""}, "Team India Jersey": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/icc-world-cup-2019-men-in-blue-to-go-orange-against-england/articleshow/69868037.cms", "description": ""}, "Bipasha Basu": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/wife-bipasha-basu-posted-a-meme-on-hubby-karan-singh-grover-and-we-cant-stop-laughing/videoshow/69856115.cms", "description": ""}, "OJEE Result 2019": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/ojee-2019-results-odisha-joint-entrance-examination-results-announced/articleshow/69857920.cms", "description": ""}, "Kolkata: Baggage loaders\u2019 stir delays three flights": {"description": "KOLKATA: Three IndiGo Airlines flights scheduled for takeoff between 3.15pm and 4pm were delayed by at least 15 minutes each following a flash protest by outsourced baggage loaders.

Sengupta, 30, said she was returning home along with a colleague in an app-based cab, which was hit by a few bike-borne youths who dragged the driver out and roughed him up. The model claimed that she had sought help from officers of Maidan police station in the heart of the city, and later went to Charu Market police station in south Kolkata. On both occasions, she was allegedly told that the incident did not happen in their jurisdiction. The Kolkata Police on Tuesday said it has also initiated an inquiry into the alleged non-registration of FIR. \"A few boys on a bike without any helmet hit our cab at Exide intersection and Jawaharlal Road crossing... Around 15 boys appeared from nowhere and dragged the driver out, started beating him up. This is when I stepped out and started shouting, calling the police and simultaneously started taking a video of the entire incident,\" she said. She claimed that officers of the Maidan police station, within 50 metres of the spot, initially did not come for help despite her repeated requests. She was told that the crossing falls under the jurisdiction of Bhawanipore police station. \"It was only when I broke down and pleaded that the driver would get killed that the officers responded. But the boys pushed the police officers and fled,\" she said. After about 10-15 minutes, two officers came from Bhawanipore police station but as it was past midnight by then, Sengupta decided to pursue the case on Tuesday morning. Accordingly, she requested the driver to drop her colleague and her at their homes. The ordeal continued as six boys on three bikes reappeared and started following the cab near the Lake Gardens area in south Kolkata. \"They stopped my car, threw stones and dragged me out and tried to break my phone to delete the video. My colleague jumped out out of fear and I started shouting to attract some locals' attention there. \"I managed to telephone my dad and my sister at my residence in the next lane when they escaped,\" Sengupta said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Sukesh Jadab, a former pradhan of Mahanandatola gram panchayat, is accused of embezzling funds from Mission Nirmal Bangla and the 100 days work scheme under National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA). While Trinamool welcomed the action, Jadab alleged his arrest was a conspiracy. The CM had on Tuesday warned her party workers against indulging in corruption. Jadab was produced in the subdivisional court and remanded in police custody for seven days. On his way to court, Jadab said: \u201cI am the victim of a political conspiracy.\u201d Back in 2013, Jadab had become pradhan as a Congress candidate. In November 2017, Ratua I BDO Arjun Pal lodged a complaint accusing Jadab of misappropriating more than Rs 1 crore from NREGS and Nirmal Bangla schemes. It was alleged that while records showed 2,600 toilets were built under Nirmal Bangla scheme, these didn\u2019t exist on the ground. Before the 2018 panchayat election, Jadab defected to Trinamool. A police probe launched following the BDO\u2019s complaint was then allegedly hushed up. Jadab, however, lost the 2018 local polls but continued to work as a local Trinamool leader. Following Trinamool candidate Mausam Noor\u2019s loss in the Lok Sabha elections, Bengal\u2019s ruling party became desperate to improve its image.

By her own admission, few among those who had taken a dig at her once are \u201chappy\u201d that she is now a member of Parliament. Others are requesting her to address the problems that are plaguing the Bengali film industry. Days after she attended Parliament, Locket spoke to CT about her plans for organising a meeting of Tollywood artistes with the prime minister and what she expects from fellow Parliamentarians Nusrat Jahan and Mimi Chakraborty. Excerpts: How was your first day at Parliament?It was a good experience. All this while, I used to tune in to the television to watch the proceeding inside Parliament. To walk down those hallowed corridors is a great feeling. More so, because I contested the elections as a leader from the opposition and won. Did you meet other Parliamentarians from the entertainment industry?Nusrat and Mimi weren\u2019t there. I saw Satabdidi (Satabdi Roy). Dev was there too. Dev\u2019s current identity is that of a politician as well as an entertainer. Though you come from the world of movies and serials, you have long distanced yourself from acting and are extremely active at most political events\u2026I had noticed that entertainers were not considered to be hardcore politicians in Bengal. I had always wanted to break that image. I have not joined politics to make a guest appearance. I have worked very hard for it and I don\u2019t wish to be taken lightly. I came to Delhi on Saturday. On Sunday, we had a meeting of a Parliamentary executive committee. This is a very serious body and they must have seen something in me before choosing me to be the whip in charge of the party\u2019s women members. I have been made one of the three whips to handle women BJP MPs. A total of 18 whips were appointed to work under the BJP\u2019s chief whip. The whips are expected to assist the chief whip in ensuring the presence of MPs in the House when important bills are taken up. The Parliament session begins at 11 am. Before that, we have a meeting at 10 am. There were people from the industry who had once called you \u2018palti didi\u2019 when you changed sides. Has their attitude towards you changed now?I won\u2019t take names. Many are calling me up now. Some of them who are present at meetings of the ruling dispensation have called me up privately and said they are very proud of me. They have messaged me saying: \u201cEgiye jaa. Songe achhi (Go ahead. We are with you)\u201d. What do you tell them then?I just smile and say: \u201cBhalo thakis (stay well)\u201d. I don\u2019t know what they will do in future. These were my old friends from the industry. In between, for some reason, they didn\u2019t keep in touch. Now, they are back. My roots lie in Tollywood. Those returning to re-establish ties with me are always welcome. Some had gravitated to a certain side because they felt doing that would ensure jobs for them. But they got used in the process without getting the jobs that they had fancied. Babul Supriyo has acted in more movies after he became a member of Parliament than what he did when he hadn\u2019t joined politics. Haven\u2019t acting offers increased for you now?(Laughs) Since 2016, I was not allowed to do any films. Now, I don\u2019t have the time for movies. The industry often recognises the skillsets of artistes once they are in positions of power. Is there any new-found respect for your acting skill?Yes, people are talking about my acting skills. Since the past six months, people are sending their scripts across to me. I am now being approached for committees formed regarding acting. Are you amused by this shift?(Laughs) Nothing really affects me now. Those who ignored me till yesterday now want to exchange pleasantries with me. Amar songe emon tui-tukari korchhe jeno roj anekhon adda martam amra (They talk to me in a way that makes me feel that we have long adda sessions regularly). They send me scripts, insisting that my presence will help the projects. I have seen the world enough to not get perturbed by all this. There are talks of you spearheading a movement in Tollywood that will challenge the functioning style here\u2026Many, including veteran artistes, are calling me up. But let me make it very clear. Here, I talk as an artiste and not a politician. I know the problems that exist in the film industry. As an artiste, I can fight for the rights of my fellow members from the industry. Payments for overtime are not cleared. Earlier sets were built for shooting. Now, artistes are taken to real locations and asked to shoot without providing the required infrastructure to the unit. The working conditions are terrible.How do you propose to change all this?There has to be an end to this. There is the nagging problem of making unreasonable demands to outstation crews if they want to shoot in Bengal. Many of them are so fed up with this \u201ctolabaji\u201d that they just come, see the locations, say \u201cthank you so much\u201d and then shoot in Mumbai. They are forced to take technicians who are ill-quipped to handle the equipment. This can\u2019t just go on. I have worked with small units too where films were made with passion and on shoestring budgets. We all pitched in and took less remuneration because we wanted the films to be made. However, things got derailed. Despite the best efforts, these projects couldn\u2019t happen because of the enormous demands of the guilds. Nobody could protest. Veteran hair dressers don\u2019t get their due while newbies with no skillset are given monetary rewards. Producers \u2014 who used to once do a lot of big serials \u2014 simply vanished because they got no slot to showcase their programmes. Bengali film productions abroad had to fold up. Shootings have got cancelled. This involves the future of so many people. How can the industry grow if all such things are allowed? Are you trying to form an alternative guild/forum?I want to fight for those who have been exploited. They are the ones who will lead the movement in Tollywood. I will be there beside them to create this alternative space. Bollywood stars had gone to meet the Prime Minister. Do you have any such plans for Tollywood?Of course, I do. I would want to organise a meeting with a core group from Tollywood and our prime minister. I want to brief him on the current situation in Tollywood. Many technicians and artistes have expectations from me. I have to meet those expectations. Can we expect to see a selfie of Tollywood artistes with the prime minister?Yes. But it\u2019s not about selfies. I want the meeting to help the industry. There is already talks about two groups by BJP leaders \u2014 one by director Shankudeb Panda and another by designer Agnimitra Paul \u2014 forming two separate units in Tollywood. This has become a butt of ridicule and confusion. What\u2019s your take on that?These are just means to divert the attention away from the actual problems plaguing Tollywood. Why create rifts when we are only trying to improve the condition of the industry? I want to find out a means by which elderly technicians can be given pension. They have given years to the industry but there is no one to look after them once they are past their prime. Why should I be distracted by talks about rifts when I am only concerned about standing beside those who are in need and/or have been exploited in this industry for years? When it comes to the film industry and politics, entertainers are often up for a lot of challenges. Mimi and Nusrat were trolled heavily when they contested and even on their attire at the Parliament. What do you have to say to that?I don\u2019t support the way Mimi and Nusrat were trolled. No one should face this. Nusrat\u2019s marriage is in the news. Do you have any message for her?I wish her the very best for her new journey ahead. While marriage is a big event in one\u2019s life, she must not ignore the promises she made while contesting the elections in Basirhat. From cutting hay with village belles to riding autos, entertainers across party lines have often engaged in various gimmicks while asking for votes. Once they win the polls, they disappear from the constituency. Does that impact the image of entertainers-turned-politicians? Is that why star politicians are often not taken seriously?All I can say is that it isn\u2019t fair to fool your voters. A leader can\u2019t ask for votes, claim to be just a phone call away and then vanish in the time of need. Being an MP is a big responsibility. The poor expect certain things from their elected leader. Guest appearances by star politicians are a huge let down. If you can say you are the \u2018ghorer meye\u2019 before the polls, you have to be around when the \u2018ghor\u2019 is burning. You can\u2019t give alibis for personal events and shy away from your responsibilities. Nusrat should visit Sandeshkhali and spend time there. How frequently will Hooghly get to see you?I am returning on Saturday and will be going there on Sunday.

Back from the ICU at NRS after nine days, the young doctor is eager to resume work but doctors have advised him rest. \u201cI have been told that the chief minister has assured the doctors of certain measures to prevent mob attacks. I understand that the situation cannot improve overnight. But I trust that things will start changing for better from now on,\u201d the young doctor told TOI. Hit by a brick on the head, Tekwani, who was on duty at the emergency ward, was treated at the ICU of NRS Medical College and Hospital. His received six stitches and the scalp also developed oedema, which luckily did not percolate to the brain tissues. \u201cThe assault left me disoriented the first two days. I had no idea about the protest. My friends told me about it only on the fourth or fifth day, after I was in a more stable condition,\u201d Tekwani said. The resident of Raipur in Chhatisgarh had ranked high in NEET-UG and could secure an MBBS seat at several medical colleges across the country. But he chose Kolkata \u201cbecause of the quality education offered here\u201d. \u201cI learnt Bangla within a year of my MBBS at NRS so that it would help me interact with patients. I was happy with the quality education offered here. I was excited and eager about my internship till that incident took place,\u201d Tekwani said. He wants to take up either psychiatry or general surgery in his post-graduation. Both Yash and Mukhopadhyay, who started their internship in March, are now fighting the mental trauma that the attack has caused. Tekwani pointed out that the mob attacked them but all they had made every effort to save the patient. They had even administered life-saving drugs, he claimed. \u201cIt was a mob of around 200 with sticks and bricks, assaulting us in front of the police. How could those truckload of people be allowed inside the hospital in the first place? I will never forget that incident. But I will not let it scare me away from work,\u201d he said. Thanking those who supported the movement by junior doctors, Tekwani said, \u201cThis was required so that such incidents can be prevented in future. Thanks to my friends and teachers for looking after me well.\u201d Tekwani has not let his parents visit him in Kolkata as he feared the protest might worry them even more. Now that he has been discharged from hospital, he will go home to recuperate, as advised by doctors. But before leaving, he plans to visit Mukhopadhyay and try to talk him him of his trauma. \u201cInternship is a crucial part of my training. We are doctors and we cannot afford to keep ourselves away from patients. I would have loved to join duty immediately, had the doctors not advised complete rest. I will return soon with renewed energy,\u201d Yash said.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

There are complaint boxes at the hospitals while a counter functions there in daytime for people to bring forward their complaints. Hospital authorities admitted that these grievance cells need to be revamped for better communication with the families of patients. \u201cThere has to be a unit absolutely dedicated for grievances and it has to be manned 24x7 so that people can seek help, get information about their patients\u2019 conditions and inform the authorities about their grievances,\u201d said an official at RG Kar Medical College.

We need to haul up the system so that patients\u2019 families can get their grievances heard by the hospital authorities. We will be working once we get a nod from Swasthya Bhawan about the modalities on such a cell,\u201d said an official at Medical College Hospital.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

Archisman Bhattacharjee, one of the prominent faces of the agitation, started his day by making the rounds of his department\u2014chest medicine\u2014at Medical College and Hospital (MCH). The first-year post-graduate student then went to the transfusion medicine department to donate blood for children suffering from thalassaemia. \u201cAll of us resumed immediately after we announced the end of the cease-work. In addition to attending to patients, we will have regular meets to follow up on and track the implementation of the assurances made to us,\u201d said Bhattacharjee, who completed his MBBS from NRS Medical College. Bhattarchjee, who had drawn flak from the media for telling them to \u201cbehave yourselves\u201d during an interaction with the media on the NRS campus a few days ago, he seems to have won the heart of the medical fraternity after he politely told the CM, \u201cWith due respect Madam, amra patients er surname dekhe treatment kori na. (With due respect Madam, we don\u2019t treat patients, based on their surnames).\u201d He was the first from the junior doctor\u2019s delegation to open the dialogue during the Nabanna meet on Monday. \u201cI witnessed Paribaha Mukhopadhyay and Yash Tekwani being assaulted in front of my eyes. By sheer luck, I escaped unhurt that night. I wanted to help and rescue them but we were simply outnumbered. How could I not demand for justice after seeing such brutal assault?\u201d said Indrajit Malik, another junior doctor. The third-year post-graduate student of general surgery was on emergency duty on the night of June 11, when the mob assault took place. Malik was among the 31 doctors, who interacted with the CM on Monday. On Tuesday, Malik went back to attending to indoor patients, helping with pre-anaethesia checks and investigation of those, admitted to unit I of his department, slated for surgeries. In the evening, he visited Mukhopadhayay at his hospital and returned to NRS to join emergency services. \u201cWe have already formed a core committee to follow up on the assurances that the chief minister has given us. We realise that not everything can be mended overnight. But implementation has to be time bound. This time, we will follow up closely so that the mass movement does not go waste,\u201d said Anirban Nath, a house staff at College of Medicine and JNM Hospital Kalyani. For the agitating junior doctors, it was a dilemma between the devil and the deep sea. They knew patients were suffering because of their cease-work but at the same time, decided not to go back to work before the chief minister spoke to them. \u201cIt is a relief that the stalemate has ended. We never wanted to stay away from work. But had we not done anything, such assaults would have gone on unabated,\u201d ,\u201d said Sayan Roy, house staff at CNMCH, who was also at the Nabanna meet.

To worsen matters, a cloudburst upstream Teesta on Monday led to floods. According to authorities, nearly 60 tourist vehicles were stranded between Lachen and Zeema-III in the Lachen Axis, one of the popular destinations among tourists. Authorities responded immediately and started clearing roads to evacuate the tourists back to Lachen and Chungthang before they could be sent back to Gangtok. The Army has been kept on standby to provide assistance in case the situation worsened. Several tourists from Kolkata said the rain washed out their plans. \u201cWe had planned to cover a great deal on Monday and had just begun checking out local markets when the downpour started. We managed to get back to the hotel safely with help from local authorities. The hotel arranged for food and water. Though it was a disappointment to miss a day, we are thankful that matters didn\u2019t worsen,\u201d said Sagar Choithramani, a second-year commerce student of St Xavier\u2019s College, who is on a tour of Sikkim with friends. Bhowanipore resident Swastik Jain (19) said, \u201cWe had to weave through heavy traffic after crossing the Teesta on our way from Siliguri to Gangtok. We could make out that current was strong and there were rumours of a tourist car falling in the river. It was very scary.\u201d \u201cOur troubles did not end after reaching Gangtok. The restaurants closed earlier than usual and we had difficulty in arranging for food. Many food joints were charging more than the usual prices as they were paying more to procure stocks. We ran out of fuel on several occasions while travelling. Local authorities helped us by arranging for fuel,\u201d he added. Communication was another problem. St Xavier\u2019s College student Yogesh Choudhury said mobile networks were weak and tourists couldn\u2019t get in touch with their families back home.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

A letter issued to them stated that their appointments stand cancelled with immediate effect. The letter has been signed by two ex-officio governors \u2014 Canning and Swarup Bar. The governors \u2014 Anil Mukherji, COO of Tollygunge Club, Suchitra Guha of Tata Steel, Anjali Das of United Missionary and Gerry Arathoon, chief of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations \u2014 called the move \u201cillegal\u201d and have decided to move court. They had been nominated in March by former bishop Probal Dutta. The present administration, headed by Canning, found the manner in which the nominations were conducted \u201cinappropriate\u201d. Hence the decision to revoke the nominations. The letter was issued on Wednesday on the basis of a meeting convened on Tuesday. The four governors sent their protest letters to the Bishop on Tuesday evening. In his protest letter on Tuesday, Gerry Arathoon had written: \u201cI ... understand that the purported termination of Mr Calvert\u2019s services has been made without any allegation or charge against him and without informing him as to why his services were no longer required or affording him an opportunity of being heard in connection with the same.\u201d Regarding Wednesday\u2019s letter, Mukherji said: \u201cIt is arbitrary. Why couldn\u2019t they say what kind of irregularities they found in our nominations? What is it that they exactly mean by procedure? We will challenge this legally.\u201d Guha, too, said: \u201cThey have removed us because we are protesting against their whimsical ways. But there is a constitution that needs to be followed and we will fight back.\u201d Canning was in Delhi and did not receive calls, but the letter of removal of the four governors is in possession of TOI. \u201cThere are age-old conventions that need to be followed while making these nominations, but these were ignored by Dutta. So the four governors have been removed,\u201d said a senior official of the Bishop\u2019s House. Meanwhile, Canning has moved the HC to obtain a stay on the order of the city civil court regarding his inclusion as a party to the suit of former Bishop Ashoke Biswas against the Church of North India for removing him from his position.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on what is being done politically. I have doubts about the credentials of those who are claiming that work isn\u2019t happening in this industry. The problems that had festered in the industry after the 34 years of Left regime have been sorted out because we have all united to fight the malice. If work is happening, there will be problems. We sit across the table and sort out the problems. What about the non-clearance of dues? Fingers are being pointed at not just one producer. Other names have also cropped up\u2026We have started processing the dues. I only know of one producer with whom people have issues. As far as my knowledge goes, all the dues have more or less been cleared. We have no complaints from technicians regarding dues from other producers.

But suppliers have a different guild. So, I can\u2019t really talk about that. There are talks about many of your guild members who are not technically sound. What\u2019s the criterion for getting a guild card?A person has to be technically sound to get a card. We see the qualification and past experience. At least two or three years of experience is required. We prefer if an assistant director is a graduate. Is there a fixed format? A hairdresser might not need to be a graduate to do the job. How do you judge if they are good or not? They can just claim that they are good. Who decides whether or not a person makes the cut?Fields like direction, camera, art direction and editing need proper training from institutes. There is so much of learning required to do good makeup or even hair. Work experience is of huge help. We keep an eye on both these factors while giving a card. If we send a makeup artist to a set where the director wants a certain look, he or she has to deliver. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t work. We have heard of complaints against many card-holders who are technically challenged and end up being a baggage on sets when it comes to handling high-end cameras etc. Have you ever taken away their cards?We have very few members who are inexperienced or don\u2019t know work. Even if we are to believe that this number is 5%, do you take away their cards? After all, they are a burden for any production unit\u2026They go to assist the main technicians.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "BJP List 2019 Maharashtra": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/two-sitting-mps-from-state-denied-tickets-in-bjps-list/articleshow/68514735.cms", "description": "AURANGABAD/KOLHAPUR: Sitting MPs Sunil Gaikwad (Latur) and Dilip Gandhi (Ahmednagar) were denied tickets for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in the BJP\u2019s first national list of candidates announced on Thursday. The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination. His late grandfather, Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, was long associated with the Congress. | Full coverage of Lok Sabha elections in MaharashtraAmong other prominent leaders from Maharashtra in the first list of candidates are Union minister Nitin Gadkari from his hometown Nagpur, state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve from Jalna, Union MoS Hansraj Ahir from Chandrapur and Union MoS for defence Subash Bhamre from Dhule. Late BJP MP Gopinath Munde\u2019s daughter, Pritam, who was elected to Parliament with a record majority after her father\u2019s death, has been renominated from Beed. Sitting MP from Sangli Sanjay Patil has also been renominated, putting an end to speculation over any change in constituency. Patil\u2019s candidature was opposed by a section of BJP leaders in Sangli. However, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is understood to have called a meeting of local party leaders and resolved the differences. The party has also given tickets to Heena Gavit from Nandurbar, Raksha Khadse from Raver, Poonam Mahajan from Mumbai North Central, Kapil Patil from Bhiwandi, Sanjay Dhotre from Akola, Ramdas Tadas from Wardha, Ashok Nete from Gadchiroli and Gopal Shetty from Mumbai North.
