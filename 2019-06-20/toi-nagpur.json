A surprise pick by the ruling BJP-led NDA   , Birla's name was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself for the post, sources said. The 56-year-old leader is considered to be close to both Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah. Birla's nomination for the Lok Sabha Speaker's post also has the   backing of non-NDA parties   such as the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). Starting his political journey as a student leader, Birla was also elected to the Rajasthan Assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. He won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was again elected this year from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. Birla defeated Congress's Ramnarayan Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently-concluded general election. A conscientious parliamentarian, Birla has registered an 86-per cent average attendance in the House, asked 671 questions, participated in 163 debates and introduced six private members' bills in the 16th Lok Sabha. From 1991 to 2003, he was a key leader in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) as a state-level president first and then, as a vice-president at the national level. Birla, who holds a Masters degree in commerce, is a member of the Standing Committee on Energy in Parliament, the Committee on Petitions and the Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. He succeeds eight-time MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Lok Sabha Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this is not the first time that a relative newcomer has occupied the position. In 1996, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader G M C Balayogi, also a two-time MP then, was elected as the Speaker in the Lower House of Parliament. After his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

One of the biggest bloopers was the interchanging of SSC and HSC marks column in the portal which meant science stream students could not enter correct information. The problems were rectified later in the evening. A parent, who did not wish to be identified, said, \u201cIn the HSC marks column, they asked us to enter marks for both maths and biology. Since both fields were mandatory, we were not able to proceed further. It is obvious that students who appear for maths in HSC will not be going for biology.\u201d Another problem was faced while entering SSC marks because of a clause mentioned there. \u201cOn the screen, it was written that if you have not appeared for maths, science or english, then enter zero. But that is not possible since maths and science are compulsory subjects at SSC level. The only explanation is that the software is erroneously showing SSC fields on HSC page and vice versa,\u201d the parent said. Students also had problems entering their NEET marks. One of the students said, \u201cEntering the NEET scores basically allows me to be eligible for the 15% all India quota. But the portal was asking for marks scored in individual subjects, even though NEET authorities have only given us percentile. So, we are stuck and not able to proceed further.\u201d A student who had been trying to apply for engineering colleges said that it had become difficult to get doubts clarified as well. \u201cYou try calling on their helplines and see how many times somebody actually picks up. It\u2019s frustrating that they can\u2019t do anything without creating a mess,\u201d said the student. The CET cell authorities were well aware of the issues that their software is facing and had gone into the crisis-solving mode. Anand Rayate, head of the state CET cell, told TOI that all these issues were being discussed in his \u2018war room\u2019. \u201cWe are working on the problems and the HSC/SSC page issue will be sorted very soon. Every other hitch that is being noticed will also be rectified so that students do not suffer,\u201d said Rayate. Many academicians said that the state CET cell is not able to handle the workload well. A senior academician said, \u201cThis is the first time that they are handling the entire process and probably were not ready to take up such a large scale assignment. The earlier authority, DTE, had been doing it for quite some time and had learnt from past errors and had a well-oiled machine in place.

MahaMetro however, trashed his claim citing directives of Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS). Citing a preliminary audit report, Pawar said that MahaMetro had leased six coaches from L & T for Rs15 crore a year. \u201cMoreover, the coaches were leased for four years when they were required only for one year,\u201d he added. MahaMetro managing director Brijesh Dixit said that the coaches have been leased for three years and not four. \u201cAfter using them in Nagpur, we will take them to Pune and later may be Thane if state government awards the project to us. It takes weeks for new coaches to be tested and so the ones leased were vital for the trial run and inspections of Research Design and Standards Organization (RDSO) and Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS),\u201d he added. \u201cWe had earlier contacted Chennai Metro, a government owned one, for two trains. However, they are four coach trains and our platforms are not that long. Secondly, they have side evacuation facility against front evacuation of our coaches. CMRS asked us to lease only those trains that are similar to ours,\u201d he further said. The cost of a Nagpur Metro train is around Rs30 crore, including taxes. However, L & T has charged Rs7.5 crore per train per year. On this, he said, \u201cEven Chennai Metro had asked for Rs7.10 crore per train. The rent is on the higher side but it's a suppliers\u2019 market. We didn\u2019t contact other Metros after CMRS directive,\u201d said Dixit. Pawar also alleged that there was a delay in delivery of coaches from China. Dixit countered it saying Nagpur Metro was the fastest in ordering the rolling stock. \u201cThere was a delay of about four months in finalizing the contract as one of the bidders had approached High Court and then Supreme Court,\u201d he said. The MD further said that cost of rolling stock as per the detailed project report (DPR) was Rs922 crore while Nagpur Metro had awarded the tender for Rs718 crore thus leading to a saving of Rs204 crore. Jai Jawan Jai Kisan had earlier alleged that the contractor for Reach III had been awarded the contract for building some stations of Reach II without any tender. Dixit said that the DPR nowhere mentioned that construction work had to be awarded to different contractors. \u201cOur contract for Reach III clearly states that work site means the places where the permanent works are to be executed and any other places as may be specified in the contract as forming part of the site. Our site in the entire city of Nagpur,\u201d he added. Pawar also slammed MahaMetro for holding joyrides saying that there was no provision for it in the DPR. Dixit said that they were held on the request of citizens, who had endured a lot of inconvenience during construction work. \u201cThe coaches from L & T were leased for trial run and not joyrides,\u201d he added. CMRS inspects Nagpur MetroA team of Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) led by commissioner Janak Kumar Garg took stock of various works being done by Nagpur Metro in Reach I (Sitabuldi to Khapri). KL Purthi and Varun Maurya were other members of the team. CMRS is here to sanction the second line of Reach I. Garg first met MahaMetro managing director Brijesh Dixit to learn about the progress of Reach I. He then held meetings with senior officials, including Mahesh Kumar, Sunil Mathur, S Sivamathan, Anil Kokate and others. The commissioner then visited Sitabuldi interchange station. He inspected the security system and various facilities available at the station. They included smoke detection system, emergency lighting, fire safety equipment, scanner, automatic fare collection gates, escalators, etc CMRS team will travel by trolley from Sitabuldi to Khapri and inspect Airport and Khapri stations on the way.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

He has sanctioned many proposals given by the state\u2019s health education department. These include seven GMCs and several research institutes. This will bring in 3,670 more MBBS seats and nearly 800 PG seats in the state in the long run,\u201d Mahajan said. The central government\u2019s health ministry has a scheme to establish new medical colleges by upgrading district or referral hospitals. As part of this, it has been proposed to convert 75 district hospitals into medical colleges to boost availability of human resource for health sector. Maharashtra has proactively submitted proposals for seven district hospitals. When these hospitals become medical colleges, the directorate of medical education (DMER) will run them instead of directorate of health services (DHS). This is still a first step. It takes time to establish a medical college even if a general hospital has many basic facilities. According to a senior official of DMER, the state as well as the Centre were keen to increase MBBS and MD seats as it was necessary for the implementation of EWS reservation. \u201cThe in-principle approval is a major step. These seven new GMCs will be functional in next two years,\u201d the official claimed. At present, there are 41 medical colleges in State. They are affiliated to Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS). In Vidarbha, there are two GMCs in Nagpur, and one each in Chandrapur, Yavatmal, Akola, and Gondia.

After the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court rejected their plea, students from the city have once again knocked the Supreme Court\u2019s doors for justice. On June 13, the HC bench consisting of justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak rejected the petition filed by Dr Sagar Sarda, Dr Sameer Deshmukh and other PG aspirants challenging Maharashtra government\u2019s ordinance for 16% seats under SEBC quota for Maratha students. The Maharashtra State Reservation (of seats for admission in educational institutions in the State and for appointments in the public services and posts under the State) for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 2019, was promulgated to supersede HC\u2019s and SC\u2019s verdicts that had quashed the SEBC quota for PG medical seats in state. Senior counsels Shekhar Naphade and Meenakshi Arora, assisted by Hrishikesh Chitale and Ashwin Deshpande pleaded for the petitioners. They contended that the HC refused to hear their plea due to SC\u2019s orders or June 4 where it had prohibited all courts from hearing any case related to this vexed issue. They pointed out that SEBC Act, which was actually implemented from November 30, was also under challenge in HC\u2019s principal bench in Mumbai. The SC judges clarified that it can\u2019t just leave the petitioners \u201cremedy-less\u201d as either HC or SC had to adjudicate the issue. They pointed out that SC itself had directed the petitioners to approach the Nagpur bench for relief. In their plea, the PG aspirants pointed out that HC had refused to entertain their contentions citing top court\u2019s orders of June 4 and 10. They argued that the SEBC ordinance was contrary to the law set by the SC and prayed for its quashing. According to them, the ordinance is clearly an attempt to nullify the HC\u2019s May 2 judgement that was later upheld by the SC. It\u2019s also an effort to circumvent the apex court\u2019s directives that amounts to interfering with its order. They were been prejudiced by the ordinance of illegally applying reservation and thus depriving them of benefit of the HC and SC orders. The ordinance is thus contrary to the law laid down by SC and deserves to be set aside. Both Sarda and Deshmukh had filed first petition in the Nagpur bench where they had challenged 16% SEBC quota in the PG medical seats, which was quashed by the bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Pushpa Ganediwala on May 2. While clarifying that the SEBC quota would be made applicable from the next academic year only, the HC had declared provisional PG seats matrix of March 27 that had a provision for SEBC candidates as \u201cillegal\u201d.

During the past two years there have been several wild animal and bird deaths under mysterious conditions in the buffer zone of NNTR in Gondia district. These deaths continued during this summer season too. \u201cIn some cases, samples were collected and sent for forensic and pathological examinations to various labs but unfortunately in most of the cases results were inconclusive due to sample getting contaminated or being unfit due to various reasons. Our idea to give lessons to the staff and teach them about forensics,\u201d said Anil Kumar, manager of Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), which organized the training. A study done by NGO Wild-CER revealed that in most cases samples are not collected properly, using right preservatives, labelling and transportation, which leads to flawed results. According to National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra collect highest number of samples for tiger deaths for forensic examination but Maharashtra has highest number of collected samples remaining inconclusive. To address the problem, both Wild-CER and WTI came together to fill the knowledge gap among front-line employees from NNTR and buffer zone of Gondia and Bhandara divisions. The training was given by experts like Dr AB Shrivastav, retired HoD, School of Wildlife Forensic & Health, Jabalpur; Dr Priya Baviskar, assistant professor with Nagpur Veterinary College; and Dr Bahar Baviskar, director, Wild-CER. It was attended by 122 front-line staff of NNTR and Gondia and Bhandara divisions. The training briefed on introduction to forensic study and its scope, collection, preservation of samples, various types of examinations to be done, right packing, labelling and delivery of the samples, scat collection and health monitoring.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar.

Indamer Aviation which has been allotted land next to the Air India\u2019s MRO, has completed 70% of construction work with four hangars ready. It plans to start operations by December end this year. Indamer Aviation in which two Indian businessmen Prayaj Patel and Sunil Gupta have a stake has tied up with US aircraft maintenance services provider AAR. The MRO, spread in 30 acres of land in the SEZ, will be taking up framework maintenance of Airbus 320 aircraft. This means the outer body, interiors and work except major overhaul of the engines will be done here. Rajesh Gupta, the CEO of Indamer said his company hopes to get the FAA and EASA approvals from the American and European aviation authorities in the coming months. If secured in the expected time, Indamer Aviation\u2019s set up in Mihan can be the first framework MRO to be operational in India. \u201cThis would be a win-win situation for the company, airlines and also the government as it would save a substantial foreign exchange outgo,\u201d he said. \u201cAirlines like Indigo and Go Air have already expressed their willingness to offer business to Indamer Aviation after the operations begin. This means the MRO hopes to have sizeable business in the initial stages itself,\u201d he added. Indamer Aviation is also the oldest MRO in the country. It began in 1939 with a single hangar near the Juhu Airport. The company was then promoted by American entrepreneur Joseph Koszarek. In 2007, the company became part of European Aviation holding Company Private Limited (EAHC). Finally Patel and Gupta invested in the business. With the Nagpur venture, Indamer will be taking up works for the civil aviation aircraft for the first time. This means, so far it was taking up the servicing of private jets, and at Nagpur it would be catering to even aircraft deployed by various airlines, explained Gupta. Meanwhile in what may give another boost to the Mihan-SEZ, the Concor\u2019s Inland Container Depot (ICD), is expected to start within a month\u2019s time. All that needs to be done is that the ICD needs to be connected with the station by the railways. Concor is a subsidiary of Indian Railways that is engaged in transport of cargo containers to the seaports. Concor\u2019s chief general manager for Central India Arunkumar Satpathy said the agency is in a position to start the facility in a month\u2019s time if the rail connectivity is established. Under the present situation, trains running from the direction of Nagpur to Mumbai can reach the ICD but not those form the opposite direction. \u201cThere has been a time overrun as the work was expected to have been completed by 2016.

The last date for applying for a photocopy ended on Monday. In Nagpur, over 5,000 students applied for photocopies of HSC while over 1,000 applied for SSC. In Amravati, over 1,700 HSC students applied for photocopies while only 1,000 did so for SSC. A senior board official said, \u201cThis time the rush for applications at Nagpur was extremely high. It was definitely more than three times of what we witnessed last year.\u201d TOI was the first to report about huge rush across the state for paper valuation as many science students saw their scores being extremely low in one of the core subjects. The Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association had issued a statement at that time saying their members have not made any mistake in evaluation, and the marks are just a reflection of how students performed on a particular day. With every subject\u2019s photocopy costing Rs400, the two boards in Vidarbha have raked in a minimum of Rs50 lakh in application fee. Madhusudhan Mude, president of Headmasters Association (HA) said the fee was too high and should have been brought down. \u201cMajority of the students apply for at least two subjects, some even go for three. This means that the board offices could have earned more Rs1 crore also. I think there is no reason for such a high application fee to be charged as most of the students in state board are not very economically strong so there is absolutely need for the board to be charging such an high amount,\u201d said Mude.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\".

Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

A group of leaders led by former MLA Ashish Deshmukh had met district collector Ashwin Mudgal more than a fortnight back and appraised him about the dwindling water scenario in orange orchards. In their representation, they had demanded 90% subsidy on drip irrigation, supply of water through tankers in highly dried areas for irrigation and advising state agriculture farmers to guide in mulching. \u201cThe collector had assured us to forward our demands to the chief minister. Unlike western Maharashtra, Vidarbha\u2019s horticulture farmers have got no compensation for drought in areas like Kalmeshwar, Katol and Narkhed,\u201d said Deshmukh. The state agriculture department has also not conducted any survey yet to assess the extent of the orchard drying. R Bhonsale, joint director agriculture, Nagpur division, told TOI that the survey can be done only on directions of the district collector. \u201cWe have no such instructions yet,\u201d he said. New state agriculture minister Anil Bonde said that he took meetings of agriculture secretaries and directors, and told them to generate their own data on affected areas without depending on the revenue department. \u201cAgriculture department officials should remain connected with farmers and always have an estimate of any losses about all crops,\u201d he said. Though most farmers are claiming that their orchards incurred permanent damage, MS Ladaniya, the director Central Citrus Research Institute (CCRI), has denied it. \u201cIt is temporary drying. Even if a few green leaves are present on a tree, it can be revived through rain. But this is possible only in the areas where there is heavy and deep soil in orange growing areas in Morshi, Warud and Katol tehsils. Oranges in shallow and light soils will not survive such drought,\u201d he said. Ladaniya claims that CCRI had issued advisories to orange growers to thin the fruits (remove half fruits) from trees to reduce the loss on a tree. The institute had also suggested mulching (covering of the tree bottom by grass, straw or even plastic) to prevent evaporation losses. This helps conserve water near the roots. \u201cThe state government needs to take the issue seriously. Farmers should be advised to retain moisture in soil and spend more money on it. Last monsoon had a 23% deficit. If this persists, this year too the situation will be grave. There should be a water grid for proper distribution. It is an expensive proposition but is one of the solutions,\u201d said Ladaniya.

Even as the demand for reservation will not be withdrawn earmarking of such an amount will certainly leave the community enthused. \u201cThe grudge that Dhangars have not been granted ST status will certainly not come in the way of the good news that as much as Rs1,000 crore has been sanctioned. This has set a precedent as never before a substantial amount was specifically sanctioned for the benefit of a single community,\u201d Mahatme told TOI. Before the state elections, BJP had promised Dhangars, a community of shepherds who are now classified as nomadic tribes (NT), reservation as STs. The promise has remained unfulfilled. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said that the government will send its recommendations to the centre on the basis of a report on Dhangars\u2019 socio-economic status prepared by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). Even as TISS has submitted its report in November 2018, it has not been tabled in the state assembly. However, Mahatme said not getting ST status may not affect Dhangars votes for the BJP. Dhangar leaders in NCP and Congress have called the allocation a mere eyewash. They said they would be taking up the issue with their respective party high commands demanding that a mass agitation should be launched. Mahatme\u2019s own popularity had waned after he accepted the Rajya Sabha seat from BJP and the agitation lost steam. Mahatme said, \u201cReservation is affirmative action intended for the benefit of a certain class. Finally, if benefit is the aim, it can also come through measures announced in the budget.\u201d he said. On the reservation issue, he said, \u201cThe BJP has at least declared a package but no other party is talking about reservation.\u201d The Rs1,000 crore include facilities like scholarships and assistance for buying land. Ram Hari Roopkunwar, a Dhangar leader from Congress in Sholapur, said, \u201cBJP has only exploited the community for votes.\u201d He said will he put up a proposal in a forthcoming meeting of various community leaders and a mass agitation will be launched. Ramrao Wadkute of NCP in Hingoli said that the Dhangars have been left disillusioned. \u201cIt is just an allocation. The final implementation will take its own time. I will be taking up the issue with the party leadership and woo the community to launch a struggle. The Dhangar leaders are ready with all the resources,\u201d he said.

A division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi was hearing an application moved by lawyer Manoj Sable where he pointed out lack of facilities in the lower court premises due to which three women lawyers were stuck up in one of the lifts and needed to be admitted in the ICU after being suffocated on June 11. The application was filed in PIL (No 67/2015) by Sable through counsel Shreerang Bhandarkar praying for directives to the PWD for construction of additional infrastructure like courts and bar rooms for convenience of lawyers and litigants. Firdos Mirza appeared for high court, while Uday Dable pleaded for District Bar Association (DBA). Earlier, the judges added ThyssenKrupp Elevators, which was having annual maintenance contract (AMC) for the lifts in entire District and Sessions\u2019 Court complex, as a respondent in the case, following its failure to do servicing of lifts that led to last week\u2019s accident. In its affidavit, the PWD executive engineer (electrical division) Manish Patil informed that generator set for providing backup for lifts was purchased way back in 1968 and has now become outdated. The work order to purchase a 500 KVADG set of generator is given to the agency to assist 100% power backup. He sought 40 days to replace it with new one. However, the judges turned down his request, asking him to complete the formalities within 20 days. Patil also referred to some of the points raised by PDJ Vibha Ingle in her affidavit to the court where she had pointed out non-compliance of 16 electrical works by the PWD. He informed that most of the works were completed in this regard. In last hearing, the bench had directed respondents to ensure sufficient measures for fire safety in the building, to avoid any eventuality. To this, the PWD informed that for fire safety measures, an estimate was technically sanctioned by the department and its tender was floated on June 11. Its tender bid would open on July 5. The administrative approval for installing new fire fighting system was received on June 12. Patil came out with startling revelation that the work on providing firefighting system could be completed within 40 days and later permission from the Nagpur municipal Corporation (NMC) could be obtained. It means, there is no firefighting system in the premises which is thronged by over 20,000 visitors every day, thus putting their lives at a big risk in case of emergency, according to lawyers.

Shridhar Solo, from Warud and an ex-ZP member, said that the government was sitting over a proposal of Lakhara Laghu Sinchan Yojna (irrigation project). \u201cOver 30 lakh trees have died. Irrigation secretary (Eknath Dhwale) should be held responsible for this,\u201d he said. City homeopath Dr Gopal Bhutada said that he owned about 3,000 trees near Benoda village in Warud tehsil. \u201cBut there are no irrigation facilities to cater to the area\u2019s water needs for the orange crop,\u201d he said. Bhutada added that an irrigation scheme had approval and water would have been available in plenty but \u201cexecution of the project has been delayed due to unknown reasons\u201d. Bawanrao Warade, from Mohpa-Mohgaon village in Kalmeshwar tehsil, also called for government action in favour of farmers. Wandu Wasankar, from village Khadsi in Achalpur tehsil in Amravati district, owns a 20-acre orchard with 3,000 orange trees. He told TOI that orchards had dried up in Akot, Chandur Bazar and Anjangaon tehsils too. \u201cThe Sapan dam which is nearby is ready and holds water. But the government has not created channels to supply water to farmers,\u201d he said. According to Ravi Patil, who is also from Achalpur tehsil, the Sapan dam has a huge catchment area. \u201cWater could have been brought from Chandrabhaga dam too,\u201d he added. Parag Kadu, of Pardi Deshmukh village in Kamleshwar tehsil, says that though he has managed to keep most of his orchard \u201calive, 600 trees have dried up\u201d. The situation is worst in Chakdo, Ramgiri and Kahiri villages, according to him. Vasant Chaple, from Lohari Sangi village in Narked tehsil, says that he has lost 900 trees so far. \u201cThe \u2018Kar water project\u2019 is close by. It still holds 50% water but the government has not left any in the river for irrigation which resulted in the drying up of orchards. At least some trees could have been saved if water would have been released,\u201d he said. Kahapa (Narkhed tehsil) village sarpanch Pramod Bannagre said that the Khapa project water reservoir is pending since 1982. \u201cWe met guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule last year. He called a meeting but the micro-irrigation department said that they had lost all documentation. The project is dead,\u201d he said. There is news of fresh estimates being prepared. \u201cIf the situation continues like this, the farmers will be forced to move out from here,\u201d said Bannagre.

Advocate Ashish Jaiswal, former Shiv Sena MLA from Ramtek, had brought it to the notice of MWRRA that dead stock is being used without permission since last one month. In a big revelation, Jaiswal said the state government has not issued any written permission to use the dead stock. Jaiswal has filed a contempt petition against WRD, NMC, collector, and two more respondents with MWRRA. A five-member bench of MWRRA chaired by KP Bakshi held a hearing on the petition on Tuesday. In the petition, Jaiswal said using dead stock was a contempt of MWRRA order dated September 12, 2018. \u201cWRD has even allowed NMC to use more water than allocated from Totladoh reservoir. NMC did nothing to bring down losses or develop its own water sources,\u201d he said. Jaiswal told TOI, WRD and NMC committed a crime by using dead stock without permission. \u201cWRD and NMC officials failed to show any permission to MWRRA. It has come at the cost of lakhs of farmers, people, cattle and wildlife. I pleaded for appropriate action against all concerned persons from the five respondent agencies,\u201d he said. On May 14, mayor Nanda Jichkar had met CM Devendra Fadnavis and claimed to have received permission to utilize 30 MMC from dead stock. On the directives of MWRRA, WRD officials said NMC used 163 MMC as against allocation of 154 MMC as on Monday. \u201cTotal utilization of water for NMC will be around 170 MMC by June end,\u201d they said. MWRRA reportedly came down heavily on WRD and NMC for using more water than allocated. Jaiswal added NMC misled MWRRA on the quantum of non-revenue water (NRW). \u201cMWRRA asked NMC officials to inform it about current NRW. NMC officials said current NRW was 45%. Actually, NRW of NMC is much more than that. MWRRA passed strictures on NMC officials. NRW of NMC should have been 14% in current condition,\u201d he said. Jaiswal also brought it to the notice of MWRRA that NMC has failed to bring down high consumption. He said NMC was drawing and supplying much more water than norms and requirement. In the petition, Jaiswal said the respondents did not comply with one of the directives of MWRRA. \u201cNMC has not complied with direction passed by this authority by not carrying out the accrued assessment of groundwater potential with the help of Groundwater Survey and Development Agency, Pune, and Central Groundwater Board office at Nagpur.

In what it calls to be a civil disobedience movement of its kind, the Sangathana has been pressing for free access to technology in agriculture including mass use of GM seeds. The HT seeds that have been developed by American biotech giant Monsanto are resistant to herbicides (weed killers), which have glyphosate as a key ingredient. Even the glyphosate-based herbicide has been developed by Monsanto. Shetkari Sangathana has been demanding that the government should allow use of HT seeds, as it will help them save a major cost on removal of weeds by deploying manual labour. However, experts say even if the seeds are allowed, cotton farmers may not be able to use HT variety legally. Former director of Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) Keshav Kranthi said that this is because glyphosate-based herbicide are only recommended for use in teal plantations and barren land. Without being allowed to use glyphosate, HT seeds not be of any use to the cotton grower. Kranthi now heads the technical section of International Cotton Advisory Council in the US. In its comment to an earlier report carried by TOI, even Monsanto had said, \u201cIn India, glyphosate-based herbicides have been recommended for use in general weed control in non-cropped areas such as tea and pre-plant rice. It should be used only as per the recommended guidelines.\u201d Anil Ghanawat, President of Shetkari Sangathana, however said that glyphosate is non-selective herbicide and can also be used on the cotton crop. Shetkari Sangathana had started its campaign last week from Akoli Jahangir village of Akola district where farmer Lalit Bahale planted the seeds in front of police and 1,200 other farmers. If proven, this can lead to a five-year sentence. After that, farmers in districts like Wardha, Dhule and Ahmednagar have planted the seeds. This would be followed by farmers in Parbhani and Amravati. The declaration form prepared by the Sangathana will have details like farmers\u2019 name, village and the area in which the seed has been planted. Shetkari Sangathana has been pressing that the government should allow use of HT seeds. However, after the trials, Monsanto itself had withdrawn its application in 2016.

The Siraspeth resident also claimed that a police sub-inspector (PSI) and a few constables made him sit among criminals for more than five hours without registering any case against him. On his complaint to senior police officers, Zonal DCP Raj Tilak Roushan ordered an inquiry. \u201cACP from Sakkardara is investigating the matter. If a police personnel is involved, action will be taken against him.\u201d It is learnt that Kubde, who works at a petrol pump near Dorli village, was having a dispute with his wife and the duo was being counselled at the police department\u2019s Bharosa cell. His wife was residing with her parents since 1 1/2 years. The couple married two years ago and has an 8-month-old child. On June 9, Kubde claimed that he received a call from one Jadhav, apparently a policeman, who wanted to visit him.

Soon, Kubde\u2019s wife, her family members and two constables from Immambada police station too landed up there. \u201cThe cops asked me to break the lock and allow my wife to enter the house, but I couldn\u2019t do it.

The huge saving of water in Pench reservoirs will not be possible as the water resources department (WRD) is all set to miss the deadline for completing Kochchhi barrage on Kanhan river by December-end. The NMC standing committee on Tuesday approved the water works department\u2019s proposal to appoint WAPCOS Limited, a central government company, to prepare Detailed Project Report (DPR) and also execute the project to use running water of Kanhan river instead of water from Pench reservoirs for six months, from June to December. The civic body will pay WAPCOS Rs21.99 crore for the project. NMC uses water from Pench reservoirs to supply drinking water to 70% areas of the city throughout the year. Requirement of remaining water is met from running water of Kanhan river. During summer, Kanhan river has to be fed from Pench reservoirs. Huge quantum of water goes waste from Kanhan river between June and December due to lack of a reservoir on it. Therefore, NMC planned to lay a pipeline from Kanhan river and use this running water instead of water from Pench reservoirs in these six months. The plan approved on Tuesday will take at least one year for WAPCOS Limited to prepare DPR and complete the project. The plan was prepared in June last year but was delayed due to reasons known only to NMC officials. Due to shortage of water in Pench reservoirs, WRD could not supply water for irrigation during both, kharip and rabbi, seasons. NMC is drawing water from dead stock of Pench reservoirs for last one month. The Pench reservoirs are likely to get less water this year too due to construction of Chaurai dam by Madhya Pradesh upstream of Pench river. Therefore, the delay in mitigation measures is likely to increase the water crisis next year. Ruling party leader Sandip Joshi admitted the inordinate delay from the water works department in completing the process. \u201cWe have decided to award the work to WAPCOS Limited without going for tendering process due to the delay. The project would have been delayed further in case of tendering,\u201d he said. Standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane said he would check about the delay and take appropriate action. In another setback, WRD officials confirmed water cannot be stored in Kochchhi barrage this monsoon. \u201cSome 80% of the works are completed. Project require another Rs300 crore for completion. We will be able to store water only in the next monsoon,\u201d they said. The barrage costing Rs947 crore is the first on Kanhan river. Around 75 million meter cube (MMC) water could have been stored in the barrage if it had been completed in time. The project was delayed due to shortage of funds.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

With the competition in this industry getting fiercer every day, the future of animation is huge and promising. Other than being an art of drawing cartoons, animation and multimedia have emerged as an industry with tremendous revenues. The excessive use of special effects has helped animation get a hold over movies, television and advertising sectors. It is one of the most concrete, lucrative and demanding career options which serves both entertainment and education industries alike. Those in this profession create animation and visual effects for films, video games, television, mobile devices, and other forms of media using illustrations and software programmes. Animators also create graphics and develop storyboards, drawings and illustrations. They create, plan, and script animated narrative sequences, and assist with background design as well as production coordination. If you are looking to enter this profession, the possible roadmap is to enroll into degree programmes or certificate courses offering exhaustive understanding of animation, graphics & web designing and multimedia. It is advised to build a portfolio in order to showcase artistry and creative and technical skills. Gaining work experience and maintaining your proficiency is of utmost importance. Ashita Reuben, co-founder and creative head of Coffee Beans Studio, said the best part about the job is feeling satisfied at the end of the day and receiving praise from clients. She said, \u201cThe animation industry in India is expected to grow at a pace faster than any other industry. As a career option, it is a field where you can fulfil your dream of having fun as you work.\u201d The skills required to foray into this field include nurturing creativity and appreciation of aesthetics. An animator must have the ability to express ideas through drawings. This demands a good visual imagination along with appropriate sense of colour. Being able to use computerols to generate visuals, while utilizing knowledge of mathematics and physics is invaluably helpful in all aspects of this industry. You can constantly hone your craft by engaging with different projects. You should also be able to constantly update yourself with dynamic technologies. Work opportunities for quality animators and related professionals like graphic designer, multimedia and game developer, character designer, key frame animator, 3D modeler and layout artist exist in sectors of advertising, online and print news media, film and television, cartoon production, theater, video gaming and e-learning at large. This booming industry houses opportunities with government as well as private sectors. It has an open field of employment opportunities in animation studios as story board artists, animation or character artists, compositing artists, video and audio specialists, visualizing, texture and lighting artists and editors in film labs.

This challenging career allows you to work on a wide range of projects in various industries. To be successful you must be creative, detail-oriented, patient, and have the ability to see the product you are creating even before it gets put to paper or computer screen. If you enjoy being creative, can work independently, and enjoy bringing characters to life, animation may be a career choice worth considering. All the way, you are expected to be creative and artistic, with communication and time management skills. You must have computer expertise and the ability to use animation and video editing skills. Jobs related to your degree in animation include character modeller, rigging artist, animator, texture artist, games developer, graphic designer, illustrator, VFX artist, web designer Etc. Animation is a great way to make a living. It\u2019s an industry full of creative people who get excited about what they do. Starting out, expect to put in long hours to hone your skills. Be prepared to move around a bit to go where there\u2019s work. Be respectful of those you work with and you\u2019ll find many artists who are more than happy to share their knowledge and experience. The future for 3D animators as a career is wide and varied. It encompasses a wide range of industries, from working at a production studio, to small animation companies, to ad agencies, to video game manufacturers to enjoying job works as an independent freelancer. Design companies rely on logos and corporate animations. You\u2019d be amazed at how many television commercials and logos are 3D creations. Animation is opening in as many sectors you can think. You could also work at advertising agencies, design companies, animated television series, film doing background scene or creating animation web-series for YouTube or ad-series for social media. A few brave souls even decide to go it alone and make their own films. Most employers prefer to hire candidates who have a bachelor\u2019s degree or diploma in animation, computer graphics, fine arts, or a related discipline. Choosing a mentor with strong industry exposure is most important rather than just joining institutes with glossy makeups, theoretical classes, costly branding, interiors or happening environments. In the 25 years or so that I have been involved in animation, I have worked with over a dozen different studios ranging from 5 to 250 in staff. The one constant in all these studios is the human dynamism. All studios are successful because of the talent they collect. No matter what your role is, you should always be aware of those around you and learn from their collective experience. Animation, gaming and VFX is a collaborative process and everyone working on a project adds value. Respect others but don\u2019t be afraid to make your job count. If everyone does that, then you get a synergy that is impossible to describe.

Following the vision of Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari to promote ecofriendly public transport, Kukde has proposed to convert all 235 standard buses, 150 midi and 45 mini buses to run on CNG. Already the civic body had converted one bus to run on CNG, he said. Kukde also announced migration of all NMC\u2019s owned four-wheelers, including mayor\u2019s car, to CNG. \u201cBy end of this financial year, entire Aapli Bus fleet will run on CNG,\u201d Kukde claimed. About strengthening Aapli Bus service in congested areas like Itwari, Mahal, Mominpura, Kukde said operation of mini-buses will start by next month. Already, 15 buses have arrived and remaining 30 will join the Aapli bus fleet soon. \u201cEven MahaMetro has approached the civic body for starting feeder bus service from its stations. We will provide mini-buses for the purpose,\u201d he said. He announced provision of free travel for specially-abled persons and women kin of martyrs. He said civic body will bear the expenditure for martyrs\u2019 kin under \u2018Mi Jijao Mata scheme,\u2019 while state\u2019s social welfare department will fund specially-abled persons\u2019 travel. Kukde has proposed to provide common mobility card that could be used both on Metro as well as Aapli Buses. He also proposed to set up water ATMs near major bus shelters and earmarked Rs 2 crore for the purpose. Already the service has been introduced at a bus shelter near KDK College and is getting good response, he claimed. He also proposed to introduce the facility to buy tickets for Aapli Bus on mobile phones. For this, NMC is tying up with a private operator Chalo App. Using this app, commuters can also locate the bus and see timetable, eliminating need to wait. About state government\u2019s economic survey that shows NMC had earned Rs 84 lakh profit from city bus operation in last financial year, Kukde and transport manager Shivajirao Jagtap said NMC had suffered Rs 76.5 crore loss.

Accordingly Vidarbha Taxpayers Association (VTA) called a general body meeting which was presided by JP Sharma to discuss and send suggestions to the finance ministry. President of VTA JP Sharma suggested that it is high time that central government brings in Direct Tax Code (DTC), wherein the accounting year should be rescheduled to January to December so that we match the universal pattern of accounting. Secretary Tejinder Singh Renu submitted that VTA has been constantly writing to finance ministry that threshold limit of direct tax should be raised from existing Rs2.5 lakh to Rs5 lakh in DTC; likewise the tax slabs should also be 10% for Rs5 lakh to Rs10 lakh salary, 20% for Rs10 lakh to Rs20 lakh and 30% above Rs20 lakh. More accountability on assessing officers should be introduced so that sense of responsibility is there on both the sides. Vice-president Shrawankumar Malu suggested that bank lending and its procedure has been too much rigid whereby even genuine borrowers, business houses and industries are facing tough times to manage financial deals. Hence it\u2019s highly recommended that finance ministry relaxes banking procedure to its realistic position wherein financial institutions as well as business can grow steadily. Likewise more liberty should be given to bank heads in same city itself so that file data transfer and delay is eliminated. Industrialist Surendrakumar Jaiswal suggested that threshold limit of Micro Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) should be increased from Rs10 crore to Rs50 crore. Furthermore definition of MSME of Centre and State varies which creates too many complex situations. Hence they should be common for factual growth of this sector. Saqib Parekh suggested that terminology of assessment year (AY) should be totally eliminated in DTC as this FY and AY creates too much of confusion for common man and with January to December financial year the year mention would also be single, which will bring much needed clarity. VTA members present in the meeting were treasurer Pawan Chopra, joint secretaries Hemant Trivedi and Amarjeet Singh Chawla, executive body members Ashvin Agrawal, CA Hemant Sarda, Govind Patel, Veeru Balani, Rahul Agrawal, Narendrapal Singh Osan, Pankaj Roshan, Harmanjeet Singh Baweja, Pratish Gujrathi and others.

NMC has received a kit for the 2020 Swachh Bharat Survekshan, which has three broad parameters; infrastructure availability, maintenance of road premises and equipment, and feedback from commuters for rating roads on overall cleanliness, under the Swachh Bharat Survey. Bad roads or potholed roads would cost NMC 163 marks. In 2019, Nagpur city stood 58th in the Swachh survey. This means NMC will not only have to make the roads free of potholes but also keep them well maintained through the monsoon. Even open water drainage system will account for four marks. Lack of zebra crossings or stop lines will cost the civic body another four marks. Non-functioning or poor maintenance of traffic signals will also cost four marks. Encroachment on footpaths and lack of traffic signs weighs for eight marks. In recent years, NMC earned a dubious distinction for bad roads and poor maintenance of traffic signals. Civic activist and secretary of Vidarbha Taxpayers Association (VTA) Tejinder Singh Renu admitted that Nagpur will face an extreme challenge due to new parameters of Swachh infrastructure. \u201cAs a majority of roads in Nagpur are under construction, our current roads condition, water drainage, street markings and cleanliness is certainly not up to the mark. Therefore, maintaining our position will be a big challenge for city administration,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cI believe such change of parameters by ministry of urban development is deliberate so that all city administrations concentrate on road conditions, which need to be good with the monsoon around the corner. Bad roads in the rainy season makes road usage extremely dangerous, especially for two-wheeler users,\u201d he added. Our city administration needs to be strict about contractors, including those of MSRDC, NHAI and NIT, as roads are not repaired even after other work is completed. The service roads are in a pathetic condition, which makes riding absolutely miserable during monsoon. \u201cIf roads are not made motorable soon, I fear a drastic drop in city\u2019s rating in next Swachh Bharat rankings,\u201d he said. Another challenge for NMC this year will be to remain on its toes through the year, as from this year Swachh Bharat assessment would be undertaken on a quarterly basis. This move comes after many cities slipped, and were not able to maintain hygiene once they got a decent ranking on cleanliness levels in the previous Swachh surveys, and NMC was no exception. The quarterly rank of cities will play a crucial role in their annual ranking in Swachh Survekshan 2020 because of the 25% weight given to the quarterly assessment, said the official. The annual assessment will be conducted between January and February 2020, he said.

Mehta said the proposal was welcomed by NITI Ayog and the Indian officials were very positive about it. \u201cI belong to the UK unit of GAPIO, known as British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin. We have 65,000 members. In next two years, 10,000 of these will be retiring and they are willing to work in India,\u201d said Dr Mehta.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The event was organized to mark the 345th anniversary of Shivaji Maharaj\u2019s coronation. Vivek Ranade and Shivani Dani were the chief guests of the programme which was conceptualized by Praful Mategaonkar who spoke about all the forts, starting with Shivneri. The 17th century Shivneri fort is the birthplace of Shivaji and is located in Junnar, 90km from Pune. At the centre there is a pond known as \u2018Badami Talav\u2019 while on the south there are statues of Jijabai and young Shivaji. There is ample water in the fort as there are two round-the-year springs called Ganges and Yamuna, said Mategaonkar. \u201cLocated in Pune district, the large Torna Fort, also known as Prachandagad, was the first fort won by Shivaji at the age of 16. It\u2019s regarded as the first pillar of Maratha empire. It is the highest and most difficult fort to capture as it is equipped with \u2018zunjar machi\u2019 fortification,\u201d he said. About Rajgad fort, he said that it was formerly known as Murumdev, and was the capital of Maratha empire for 26 years, before Shivaji shifted the capital to Raigad Fort. The most historic place inside the fort is Padmavati Mati. Sinhgadh, 35km southwest of Pune, gets natural protection due to the steep hills. Even British army found it hard to capture, he said. \u201cThe Battle of Sinhgadh was fought between Marathas, led by a fierce general Tanaji Malusare and the Mughals. Tanaji lost his life in battle but his troupe won the fort. On hearing about Tanaji\u2019s death Shivaji said, \u2018Gadh aala, pan Sinh gela\u2019,\u201d he said. Initially known as \u2018Kondhana\u2019, Sinhgadh fort has two gates \u2014 Kalyan Darwaza and Pune Darwaza. later Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak had a historic meeting here. At 1,080 metres above sea level Pratapgadh, is famous for the battle between Shivaji and Afzal Khan. There is an Afzal tower which defends the approach towards the fort. Afzal Khan\u2019s body is buried under the tower and his dargah is located nearby,\u201d he said. About Sindhudurg fort, Mategaonkar said, \u201cLocated in Arabian Sea on the shore of Malvan town in Konkan region, Shivaji built the fort to counter the rising influence of foreign colonizers and negate the rise of Siddis of Janjira.\u201d \u201cRaigadh fort was the capital of Maratha empire. Shivaji had seized it from Raje Chandraraoji More in 1656. The fort has the Samadhi of Jijabai,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIn 1689, Zulfikhar Khan captured Raigad and later Aurangzeb renamed it as Islamgadh. Execution point \u2018Takmak Tok\u2019 can be seen clearly from the fort.

Nagpur was chosen for the study considering the hype and also the recent developments in terms of infrastructure carried out here. Knight Frank\u2019s report, which studied a number of major areas like Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Hyderabad and NCR, only puts Nagpur among the second rung centres in terms of warehousing business. \u201cDespite its strategic location, the major consumption markets such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai are 800 to 1,000km away from Nagpur. The tier II and tier III cities near Nagpur like Raipur, Jabalpur, Bhopal, Bhilai and Indore are far below in the pecking order from a consumption perspective. While it is still premature to write off Nagpur, its warehousing clusters are not getting organized as fast as other cities, post implementation of GST,\u201d says the report. Pinkesh Teckwani, national director (industrial & asset services) for Knight Frank India, told TOI, \u201cNagpur may have a strategic advantage in terms of location but having a central warehouse under the hub and scope model here does not make a feasible business proposition for many. Logistics still constitutes almost 13% to 15% of the cost component. Given the distances from major consumption centres, bringing a warehousing set-up in Nagpur would not make a major difference in terms of cost reduction.\u201d Centres like NCR or even Mumbai would be too far to be fed from Nagpur. NCR and Mumbai constitute almost 40% of the consumption, he said. Nagpur can, however, have regional hubs catering to locations within a distance of 300km, he said. It can also emerge as an air cargo hub but surface transport can\u2019t be as feasible. However, a chunk of transportation remains to take place through road. The reduction in transportation may not even be compensated by lesser rentals, he said. Meanwhile, the Knight Frank report also mentions that the Mihan project is expected to attract sizeable investments for both SEZ and non-SEZ areas, due to which Nagpur can emerge as a major cargo hub. The manufacturing industry units will include those from sectors like food processing, pharmaceuticals and textiles The large-scale industrial activity is likely to give a fillip to quality warehousing business. The industrial estates of MIDC too have a major role to play in the development. Shivkumar Rao, vice-president of Vidarbha Economic Development Council (VED), said it was always proposed that Nagpur has the prospect of emerging as a regional hub. However, even that has to be facilitated by putting in place the right regulatory framework. The state had come up with a logistics policy in 2018 which remains to be implemented completely, he said. VED had been championing for Mihan since the idea was conceived. Atul Pande, president of Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA), maintained optimism about Nagpur, said that it is the apparent choice for a logistics hub. Every part of the country is almost equidistant from Nagpur and the city is well-connected by road, rail and air, he added.

Absolving them, special judge AS Jadhav pointed out that an \u201caccused can\u2019t be labelled as a terrorist just because he was using the word jihad\u201d. \u201cAs per the dictionary, \u2018jihad\u2019 literally means \u2018struggle\u2019. It\u2019s an Arabic word which means striving or struggling. According to BBC, the third meaning of jihad is struggling to build a good society. Related words of jihad are expedition, administration, movement, strive crusade. Therefore, if merely accused used the word \u2018jihad\u2019, it would not be proper to brand him as terrorist,\u201d the judge said, acquitting all three accused of charges under UAPA. Abdul Malik Abdul Razaqque, Shoeb Khan and Salim Malik had been arrested outside a Mohamadiya mosque in Pusad town of Yavatmal district after Razaqque allegedly attacked cops on September 25, 2015. He was enraged over the beef ban imposed by the Maharashtra government and attacked police constables Amol Badukale, Yogesh Dongarwar and Sudarshan Aghav with a knife, injuring them outside the mosque on Bakri Eid. After he was arrested, the case was handed over to Mumbai-based Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS). The ATS claimed Razaqque had come into contact with Khan on Facebook and introduced him to Malik. Both Khan and Malik then instigated Razaqque to join \u2018jihadi movement\u2019 and also lured him to go to Afghanistan for training. ATS pointed out that Razaqque was highly influenced by the speeches of Maulana Masood Azar, the founder of banned terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammad, which was behind the deadly attacks on the Parliament and the recent one at Pulwama, where 40 CRPF personnel were martyred. He even used to listen to inflammatory speeches of preacher Zakir Naik and Al Qaida founder Osama bin Laden. He also ran a WhatsApp group named \u2018Friends Forever\u2019, where inflammatory material was circulated. When Razaqque\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts were checked, it was found that he was following jihadi groups. After arrest of all three, incriminating material such as CDs and Urdu material was seized. They were charged under various sections of IPC, Arms Act, and Bombay Police Act, besides UAPA. The charge sheet was filed with JMFC court in Nagpur, which remanded the case to Akola court. \u201cIt appears that Malik has exhibited his anger through violence against government and some Hindu organizations for ban on cow slaughtering. No doubt, he used the word \u2018jihad\u2019. But it was adventurous to jump to the conclusion that only for using word \u2018jihad\u2019 he should be branded as terrorist,\u201d the judge said. The court, however, maintained Malik\u2019s conviction under all IPC sections and sentenced him to three years behind bars. Since he was been in jail from September 25, 2015, he was released as he had already served his full term. The court asked Khan and Malik to furnish a surety of Rs15,000 each while acquitting them of all the charges. Speaking to TOI, Malik\u2019s father said they were happy as justice was finally done. \u201cI want to thank SP MLA Abu Azmi along with Afzal Farooki, Mayatai Chaure, Pervez Siddiqui from Nagpur for helping us in these tough times, where we lost everything. I am happy that my son had rejoined the Mohamadiya Masjid as a cleric. His son was just one-and-a-half-years-old when he was forcibly taken by the police.\u201d He added that after his son\u2019s arrest, they lost everything and suffered immense social stigma. \u201cI suffered losses in my business. We were treated like outsiders in our hometown. Now, it\u2019s up to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to inquire into the matter and punish the guilty cops for falsely implicating my son and devastating our peaceful lives.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "time": "2019-06-20 04:42:00", "datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/accused-not-a-terrorist-only-for-using-word-jihad-court/articleshow/69865003.cms"}, "Saif Ali Khan": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/world-cup-pakistani-man-tries-to-misbehave-with-saif-ali-khan-fans-back-on-social-media/videoshow/69859837.cms", "description": ""}, "SEWAGE": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/sewage/articleshow/69529611.cms", "description": ""}, "Sizzling pictures of Nimrat Kaur you would not want to miss": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/sizzling-pictures-of-nimrat-kaur-you-would-not-want-to-miss/photostory/65658289.cms", "description": ""}, "Lights Off": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/lightsoff/articleshow/69569987.cms", "description": ""}, "TV actors Ashish Dixit and Shweta Kanoje tie the knot in Nagpur": {"time": "", "link": "http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/events/nagpur/tv-actors-ashish-dixit-and-shweta-kanoje-tie-the-knot-in-nagpur/articleshow/69596186.cms", "description": ""}, "'Batti Gul Meter Chalu': All you need to know about the Shahid Kapoor-Shraddha Kapoor starrer": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/batti-gul-meter-chalu-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-shahid-kapoor-shraddha-kapoor-starrer/photo-yami-gautam-looks-absolutely-ravishing-in-a-black-dress/photostory/65791732.cms", "description": ""}, "Karnataka: Stunt goes wrong, man addicted to Tik Tok lost balance during jumping": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//videos/city/bengaluru/karnataka-stunt-goes-wrong-man-addicted-to-tik-tok-lost-balance-during-jumping/videoshow/69858872.cms", "description": ""}, "Salman Khan": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/salman-khans-90-degree-leg-stretch-leaves-fans-amazed/videoshow/69868102.cms", "description": ""}, "iPhone XR2": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/why-iphone-users-may-not-be-happy-with-the-next-iphone/articleshow/69836806.cms", "description": ""}, "Kiara Advani": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/summer-ready-kiara-advani-looks-stunning-in-this-pink-outfit/videoshow/69868586.cms", "description": ""}, "Garbage everywhere": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/garbageeverywhere/articleshow/69683871.cms", "description": ""}, "Kids steal the show in dramas staged by Fundoos Theatre": {"time": "2019-06-18 13:49:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kids-steal-the-show-in-dramas-staged-by-fundoos-theatre/articleshow/69833184.cms", "description": "NAGPUR: The auditorium of Deshpande Hall was filled with laughter and enthusiasm as the tiny tots took over the stage to present a play titled \u2018Chor Ko Pakdo\u2019 and \u2018Magic Within\u2019 organized by Fundoos Theatre. This two plays were organized after a 10-day workshop with children in the age group of 7-14 to developing their holistic skills, intellect, speech and confidence. This was the first theatre workshop under Fundoos. The little ones dressed in colourful costumes and funky hairstyle delivered perfect comic timings, dance performance in between and good dialogue delivery.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

In the near seven-decade history of orange plantations here, this is the first time that an alarming 60% orange orchards have gone completely dry and, for all purposes, died this year. The loss is stark in Warud tehsil of Amravati district followed by Katol and Narkhed tehsils of Nagpur district. For the first time, big and rich farmers are talking about selling off their lands and switching to other occupations. The vagaries of weather, scanty and erratic rains in last two years coupled with prolonged high temperatures throughout May and delayed pre-monsoon rains this year are responsible for this unheard-of plight of orange farmers. The loss caused to the ambia bahar crop alone (which fruits in September) is being pegged at about Rs1,620 crore. (mrig bahar, the other crop, fruits from February to April). However, the loss due to orchards (15-20 years) dying completely cannot be monetarily pegged. Shridhar Thakre, one of the Maha Orange directors and a big farmer, told TOI that he had stopped going to the orchards as he could not see the condition of the trees. He owns a 20-acre land with 3,500 orange trees in Talegaon village (Ashti) in Wardha district with irrigation facilities. But there is no water in the wells. The water table has gone below 1,000ft. \u201cIt is for the first time that the temperatures continuously hovered between 44 degrees Celsius to 47.5 degrees in the month of May. This year, there has been no pre-monsoon showers too. Neither the agriculture nor the revenue department has visited the orchards even once,\u201d said Thakre. Rajendra Thakre from Benoda Shahid village in Warud tehsil says he has incurred a Rs1.5 crore loss this year. \u201cI am 58 years old and have never seen such a situation in 30 years of agriculture. I have no option but to sell the land,\u201d he said. All four of Thakre\u2019s wells have gone bone dry. He tried bringing water from Paknala dam about 11km from the orchard by spending Rs18 lakh but the water in the dam too dried out soon. \u201cElectricity supply at odd hours \u2014 night and afternoon \u2014 doesn\u2019t allow proper irrigation,\u201d he said. Ramhesh Jichkar, who heads the Vidarbha Agriculture and Allied Producers Association and has oranges in 30 acres in Nagziri in Warud tehsil, says that 30% of his orchard has been affected. The water table here too has gone below 1,000ft. An average orange tree needs about 240 litres per day. \u201cPast three years has a rain deficit. Where will we get water from,\u201d he asked.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "BJP List 2019 Maharashtra": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/two-sitting-mps-from-state-denied-tickets-in-bjps-list/articleshow/68514735.cms", "description": "AURANGABAD/KOLHAPUR: Sitting MPs Sunil Gaikwad (Latur) and Dilip Gandhi (Ahmednagar) were denied tickets for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in the BJP\u2019s first national list of candidates announced on Thursday. The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination. His late grandfather, Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, was long associated with the Congress. | Full coverage of Lok Sabha elections in MaharashtraAmong other prominent leaders from Maharashtra in the first list of candidates are Union minister Nitin Gadkari from his hometown Nagpur, state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve from Jalna, Union MoS Hansraj Ahir from Chandrapur and Union MoS for defence Subash Bhamre from Dhule.

Sitting MP from Sangli Sanjay Patil has also been renominated, putting an end to speculation over any change in constituency. Patil\u2019s candidature was opposed by a section of BJP leaders in Sangli. However, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is understood to have called a meeting of local party leaders and resolved the differences.

The Rs475 crore project is a form of European Train Control System (ETCS), which is a globally recognized system of upgraded signalling and communication to improve safety, speed and punctuality. The modernization project for signalling system, which includes the Automatic Train Protection System with Long Term Evolution (LTE)-based Mobile Train Radio Communication Technology (MTRC) along with electronic interlocking, is part of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by Indian Railways with RailTel Enterprises Limited (REL) this week. Apart from Nagpur-Badnera section in Central Railway, the project would be implemented on other stretches too like Renigunta-Yerraguntla (South Central Railway), Vizianagaram-Palasa (East Coast Railway) and Jhansi-Bina section (North Central Railway). All these are among the busiest routes in the nationwide railway networks. The project would be implemented on almost 500 locomotives on the earmarked routes. The Railway Board is learnt to have taken up the Rs1,609 crore project to implement the globally acknowledged Indian version of the ETCS (MTCS) to raise the standard of safety of passengers, and increase line capacity with modern signalling and communication system to match international standards. Maninder Singh Uppal, officiating Divisional Railway Manager (DRM), Central Railways, said the latest system is the upgraded version of the already existing one, which would remove any possibility of collision. \u201cSafety, punctuality and speed would be improved. The train would automatically stop if it crosses a red signal and it would also halt in case there is a possibility of head-on or side-on collisions,\u201d said Uppal. \u201cIf the manual application fails, the brake would be immediately applied after signal passing and danger. The speed of the train would also be reduced automatically depending upon the allowed sectional speed,\u201d he said. Uppal said the speed and punctuality would both be improved by 20-30%. \u201cThe railway traffic movement in the highly congested Nagpur-Badnera section would witness a considerable improvement,\u201d said the senior railway official. Uppal said the speciality of ETCS level-II is that it would ensure continuous monitoring of the train speed vis-\u00e0-vis requirements of stoppage and control based on the status of the signal. \u201cThe system works and is based on radio communication system between the loco pilots, guards, base stations and from there to the control centre, with the help of optical fibre cable. Any official within a section operating the train would be reachable through communication set,\u201d he said. Uppal also said the budget (Rs475 cr) has already been vetted, sanctioned and sent to REL by the zonal railway authorities. \u201cThe project would mostly involve experts from international stakeholders,\u201d he said. Railway Board authorities have said that speedy execution of the project is expected as REL is already engaged in collecting, collating and analysing inputs and feedbacks from industry representatives on various aspects of technology, interfaces, compatibility and inter-operability of various sub-systems.

He was earlier caught, along with one Pranav Mhaisekar, by Chandrapur police near Nanduri toll naka on June 9 while ferrying foreign liquors in a car in the dry district. Hande and Mhaisekar were arrested by Warora police of Chandrapur district after seizing two cartons of liquor in their car. The car was driven by Mhaisekar. Hande, who was in uniform despite being a holiday, had tried to mislead the cops. Warora police was also granted two days of custody remand by the court for detailed investigation. It\u2019s learnt that the car was in the name of Mhaisekar\u2019s mother who is a medical practitioner too. City police top brass, after receiving the official reports from their Chandrapur counterparts, decided to invoke the powers granted to competent authority under article 311 (2) (B) of the Indian constitution to remove Hande from service for maligning the image of the department. The city police also cited the nexus of Hande with criminals and racketeers as the other reason for his dismissal. Another ground, proposed to dismiss Hande, was that he may influence, threaten and intimidate the witnesses if any inquiry is instituted against him.
