You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

As the state government has started purchasing onion crops at support price of Rs 800/quintal under Bhavantar Scheme, farmers of around 100km radius of the district have started reaching the mandi with their fresh crops. The number grew late on Wednesday night when the administration had to shut entry of vehicles to handle the situation. The same resulted in long queues of loading vehicles carrying crops especially onions outside the mandi while a number of trucks, which were parked inside also got stuck due to haphazardly parked vehicles. The traffic jams in and outside the mandi not only affected the business but also caused huge inconvenience to commuters. Due to the chaos, the mandi administration recorded arrival of only around 250 quintals of onion against the average arrival of around 50,000 quintal onion crops. This month, the mandi has recorded total arrival of about 4.46 lakh onion crops. The officials informed that market has capacity to accommodate arrival of 1 lakh quintal crops but on Wednesday night, over 1.25 lakh crops arrived. The traders alleged that the mandi administration has deployed 76 security guards to work in three shifts but very few of them were there to manage the traffic. \u201cSheer negligence on the part of mandi officials led to such chaotic situation in mandi on Thursday. There are many encroachments and no proper arrangement was made to guide the traffic. The market also lacks basic facilities including drinking water for the farmers, porters and traders,\u201d traders\u2019 association president Haji Maqsood said. According to mandi secretary Satish Patel, \u201cThe situation of traffic jams reported due to a sudden increase in arrival of onion crops. As decided, the vehicles carrying crops for selling/unloading in mandi will be given entry from 10pm to 9am and remaining time will be there for vehicles loading the crops and going out. A work plan is also prepared for opening a new entry/exit gate in the mandi\u201d.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years.

Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing.

There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds.

This entire region has been baking in 45-plus heat for the past week. Denied water, these monkeys died as their organs shut down due to dehydration. Shocked, the forest department is carrying out a behavioural study of monkeys in the region and has made water arrangements for the group that lost the fight. A cowherd spotted the carcasses on Friday and rushed to the nearby beat office. The alarm went out and senior forest officers scrambled to the scene. Initial autopsy showed that all the monkeys died due to heat stroke and consequent multi-organ failure. Foresters were puzzled because a pond was close by. Then, they saw a bigger band of monkeys, numbering 50-60, seemingly guarding the pond. \u201cThe water source was barely a few hundred meters from the cave where this group of monkeys lived. However, due to the dominance of another group, this group could not access the water source. To protect themselves from the heat, many monkeys entered the cave, but the rocks became hotter. Some of the weaker monkeys couldn\u2019t get out of the cave, where they died,\u201d DFO Dewas P N Mishra said. Forest officials have made provisions of water, jaggery and chickpeas for the defeated group. The carcasses were cremated, and viscera of some of the monkeys has been sent for forensic tests to Sagar to check for possible contagious infections. There are five to six groups of monkeys in the region where the deaths occurred. Foresters are surprised that territorial fights, or as in this case, a fight over water, could get so violent among monkeys. The Punjapura forest range has other herbivores, including deer, but no other fatalities due to dehydration have been reported. Forest officials have set up night vision trap-cameras to study the behaviour of monkeys and to check if any other factor contributed to the deaths.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Man tries to rape three-year-old niece in Mandsaur": {"time": "2019-06-10 09:11:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/man-tries-to-rape-three-year-old-niece-in-mandsaur/articleshow/69717509.cms", "description": "INDORE: A man abducted his three-year-old niece from her house, took her to a secluded place and attempted to rape her in Nahargarh of Mandsaur district on Sunday morning.

This was done by call centre employees who were given special \u2018script\u2019 for the same.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

It triggered a political controversy, with Congress corporators alleging that by stopping the National Anthem midway, BJP leaders had violated the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. It\u2019s the practice at IMC that meetings of the mayoral council and general body begin with \"Vande Mataram\" and end with \"Jana Gana Mana\". However, on Wednesday, some mayoral council members stood up and started singing the National Anthem, while others sang the customary Vande Mataram. Adding to the confusion, some members stopped singing and started pointing out the mistake. After some more confusion, everyone began singing Vande Mataram. IMC Leader of Opposition Fozia Sheikh Alim said, \"It was a clear dishonour of the National Anthem. It was very disappointing to see that public representatives are confused between the National Anthem and the National Song.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai.
