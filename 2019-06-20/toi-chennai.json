You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

The 4.8 lakh population in the existing 48 wards of the Avadi municipality have become part of corporation. \u201cConsidering the increase in population, growth in annual income and the level of the civic services to be provided towards fulfilment of the basic needs of the growing population\u2026 the government has decided to upgrade the municipality into corporation,\u201d said a statement issued by law department.

An Avadi resident, T Sadagopan, said: \u201cPiped water supply and underground drainage system are the two major issues which were not fulfilled by the administrators in the last two and half decades.

Governor Banwarilal Purohit had signed the order on March 9, on the eve of the election commission notifying the general elections. The commission did not give permission to notify the announcement, sources said. The government originally proposed to include Thiruverkadu municipality and Thirunindravur town panchayat and 10 village panchayats, such as Kattupakkam and Ayapakkam, but stuck to Avadi municipality alone, given the ongoing delimitation of wards for the upcoming local body polls, said Minister K Pandiarajan who represents Avadi in the assembly. Including more areas would have delayed the local body polls, he added. \u201cThere is a complete transformation of Avadi from a sleepy little bunch of eight villages 20 years ago to a modern corporation.

The party, however, went unrepresented at a meeting convened by the Centre to discuss the issue in Delhi on Wednesday. Sources said AIADMK representatives, law minister C Ve Shanmugam and Rajya Sabha floor leader A Navaneethakrishnan, could not participate after the organizers pointed out to them that the invite was meant only for party chiefs. The party later sent a note detailing its stand on the issue. The main opposition, DMK, which has opposed the \u2018one nation, one election\u2019 concept, skipped the meeting altogether. In its written submission, the AIADMK is believed to have recalled former chief minister J Jayalalithaa\u2019s stand that had been conveyed to a Parliamentary standing committee on personnel, public grievances, law and justice in 2015, just months before the last assembly elections in 2016. \u201cThere are several key issues which will have to be resolved before the model is adopted since it has wide ramifications. The party\u2019s stand is that the Lok Sabha and state assemblies should be given a fixed term first. Fixed dates of election and counting should also be announced as in the case of the Presidential election in the United States,\u201d said a senior leader, seeking anonymity. This would mean the dates would not be left to the whims of the Election Commission, that \u201csuddenly calls for a press meet and announces election schedule\u201d. The party is said to have insisted that a draft policy, that would include issues like the tenure of assemblies and Parliament, should be placed in public domain and discussed threadbare with the stakeholders. Jayalalithaa had demanded that norms should be worked out on the terms of the assemblies \u2013 either extended or cut short, as the residual period of the existing assemblies, especially that of Tamil Nadu, were not coterminous with the Lok Sabha. As the current term of the AIADMK government ends in 2021, the party is keen on completing its full term without any \u201chindrances\u201d whatsoever after registering a historic consecutive win in 2016 under Jayalalithaa. After failing to take part in the Delhi meeting, Shanmugam returned to Chennai in the evening. The AIADMK is of the view that a consensus must be arrived at ahead of any policy, given the contentious provisions in the Constitution to dissolve the assemblies and Parliament. The early dissolution will stand in the way of the conduct of simultaneous elections. \u201cA thorough discussion is required. While LS polls ended just now, there are several states that have got two, three and four years to complete. A lot of questions remain unanswered,\u201d said senior minister D Jayakumar.

The idols \u2013 of Perumal, Sridevi and Boodevi -- were donated to the temple 15 years ago. Police said that local thieves might have stolen the idols for their metal value. Since the idols were not antique pieces, they cannot be sold in their original shape. The Manamadurai police registered a case. Teams have been formed to nab the thieves. Deputy superintendent of police, Manamadurai range, G Karthikeyan said since it was village temple, there was no security in place. The only protection the idols had was a steel gate.

Not convinced with the eight-page report filed by Metrowater elaborating the measures it has taken to overcome the situation, a division bench of Justice S Manikumar and Justice Subramonium Prasad wondered what the water management department of the state was doing all these days. The authorities very well knew that the lakes in and around the city are drying but still no precautionary measures were taken to arrange alternate sources for the past one year, the bench said. Ridiculing the authorities for submitting that they have started awareness programmes highlighting the importance of water conservation, the bench wondered what is the use of doing such awareness work at this point of time. The bench then suo motu impleaded the secretary of PWD to file a report on the steps taken to de-silt four major reservoirs in the city and availability of water. The bench said judicial notice can also be taken that some of the waterbodies have been encroached which has reduced the size of the lake and encroachment is also said to be one of the causes of the reduction of storage capacity of lakes and water bodies. The court then directed the secretary who is vested with the custody of preserving the lakes to submit a detailed report of the steps taken for removal of encroachment. In this regard the secretary is directed to issue a circular to all the district collectors to submit the details of action taken for removal of encroachments in waterbodies, the court said. As the advocate general submitted that once the third desalination plant being established in Nemelli becomes functional, even failure of monsoon would not affect Chennai, the bench directed the authorities to submit a report of desalination project taken up by the government, study, if any, done for additional desalination plants.

Gas hydrates are ice-like cages, found in Indian continental coastline, in which methane gas is trapped. According to official data, over 1,900 trillion cubic meters of methane gas is untapped in these cages. This is 1,500 times more than country\u2019s present gas reserve. Methane, in the form of natural gas, is used to generate electricity and make energy. The researchers are studying new methane extraction methods so that country's natural gas import will come down. The research is being headed by professor Jitendra Sangwai from IITM\u2019s ocean engineering department. Gas hydrates should be dissociated into their constituent gas and water before methane recovery is possible, said Sangwai. Four techniques are being studied in various laboratories for this dissociation thermal stimulation, depressurisation, chemical injection and carbon dioxide injection. Sangwai\u2019s team analyses the combined effects of thermal stimulation and depressurisation in one branch of study, and polymer injection in another, said a press release. The research team reported that combination of two processes in more efficient for methane production from hydrates. This was attributed to relatively faster increase in volume available for the gas to expand upon application of heat. Also, instead of single-step, multistep depressurisation is more efficient. So, depressurisation is possibly the most likely technology to mature in near future, the release added. As far as polymer injection is concerned, researchers reported that eco-friendly polymer (polyethylene glycol-200) is best suited for extracting methane from hydrate. \u201cControlled extraction of methane from gas hydrates can not only meet the demand but can also reduce detrimental geological release of greenhouse gas into the environment from these sources,\u201d Sangwai said.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

According to Charles Kulandai, the foundation\u2019s project manager in India, the new school will replace a previous structure by the same name, which reportedly lacked basic infrastructure. \u201cBesides this, girl students from about 22 villages in the vicinity were made to drop out after Class X, as the nearest school for Class XI and XII was in Chengalpet, about 15km away,\u201d he said. The new school will have classes from VI to XII, and can accommodate more than 800 students. The campus, about a mile\u2019s distance from the old one, has been built using eco-friendly material around two green atriums. It has 21 well-ventilated classrooms, separate physics, chemistry and biology laboratories, a library, audio-visual centres, an auditorium, separate toilet blocks and expansive outdoor sports facilities. Designed by architect Priya Lourduraj, the school has adopted water-efficient landscaping with reuse of stockpiled soil, and native and drought-tolerant tree species. It also uses eco-friendly refrigerants and fire extinctions. \u201cWe focus quite a bit on our school programmes, because when children are young, they can imbibe ways to live in harmony with nature and use energy frugally, early on,\u201d says CN Raghavendran, chairman of IGBC\u2019s Chennai chapter. Elena and her late husband Alfredo who started the foundation together in 2001, had undertaken several projects in Tamil Nadu, since they started working here two decades ago. \u201cEducation is a cause that has always been at the top of our agenda in India. It is a passport to a better future and we are convinced that equipping children from disadvantaged communities with quality education is what will change their circumstances,\u201d says Elena.

The revenue administration has given instructions to the district collectors to appoint the retired officials on a temporary basis for a consolidated pay of Rs 15,000 a month in the coming days. The VAOs, the heads of the revenue administration of one to three villages, are vested with powers to collect tax, certify for government welfare schemes, maintain law and order and extend assistance to farmers from crop insurance to assessment. While the sanctioned strength of the VAOs for the entire state is 12,616, at least 2,896 posts have now fallen vacant. The government decided to fill these posts after a recommendation from the commissionerate of revenue administration that \u201cwell experienced hands\u201d preferably retired VAOs who have considerable knowledge of the duties and responsibilities would be appropriate. It is left to the discretion of the district collectors to make the appointments, keeping in mind recruitments by TNPSC, appointments on compassionate grounds or promotions of village assistants to VAO posts. The retired officials will get salaries for a period of one year or till the necessity ceases. \u201cVacancies arise due to highly-qualified personnel moving to other jobs or superannuation. As a result, the serving VAOs are burdened with work and are accused of not making their presence felt in a village,\u201d revenue minister R B Udayakumar said, justifying the appointment of retired personnel. While the public service commission is informed about the vacancies periodically, the recruitment agency had delayed holding exams, the minister said. There was a thinking in the government to have one recruitment board for revenue services on the lines of Teachers Recruitment Board and Medical Services Recruitment Board. But, it was dropped. The move to appoint retired VAOs, however, evoked strong criticism from serving officers with representations being sent to the government opposing it. \u201cThough the government justifies its move to appoint the retired personnel on a temporary basis, it is condemnable,\u201d said TN Village Administrative Officers Munnetra Sangam president G Suresh. In 2008 too, there were more than 5,000 vacancies and the serving officers managed the show, he said. Tamil Nadu Government Employees Association president A Selvam said it was a known secret that the departments like treasuries, health and rural development temporary appoint retired officers. \u201cBut this move to appoint 1,000 retired personnel is unprecedented. This would trigger unrest among the long queue of youth waiting for government jobs,\u201d Selvam said.

She has been buried, he said, in his living room. A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever. Another resident, Guddi, said, \"For poor people like us, there is no dignity in death. Due to lack of space in houses, people have to sit and walk over graves. It is so disrespectful.\" Almost all the houses in the block have graves within the compound Most of the Muslim families here are poor and landless and men scout for work as contract labourers. They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing. Living with the dead: A grave in the backyard\"All we are asking for is some land for our ancestors. There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar. Their burial grounds are filled to capacity,\" said Nizam Khan, a mechanic. Village pradhan Sundar Kumar said that he had asked officials several times for a burial ground for Muslim families, but no action was taken. Ravi Kumar NG, the district magistrate, said that he was not aware of the issue. \"I will send an official team to the village and get details of the burial land required.\" Picture Credit: Hemant Kumar In Video:Houses turn into graveyards as Muslims in this UP village bury the dead at homeDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Ashton Kutcher": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/hollywood/news/ashton-kutcher-and-mila-kunis-trash-split-rumours-in-the-funniest-way-possible/articleshow/69868560.cms", "description": ""}, "Melmaruvathur \u2013 Villupuram MEMU to be partially cancelled on June 20": {"description": "CHENNAI: Melmaruvathur \u2013 Villupuram MEMU local train will be partially cancelled on Thursday (June 20) due to line and power blocks to facilitate construction of a foot overbridge at Vikravandi yard.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

Barring a few like the Varadarajaswamy temple in Kancheepuram and Thyagaraja Swamy temple in Tiruvottiyur, very few of the 2,359 temples under the HR&CE have water. The tanks remain a rejuvenating source for urban areas. \u201cRequests have been made to see that drains are kept free of silt and debris so that inflow into the tanks can be maximized during the monsoon. Also, sewage outfalls into drains need to be plugged to ensure that only clean water enters the tanks,\u201d said an official source. The department renovated 847 of the 1,068 tanks identified for repairs in nine years. The urgency also stems from the water deficiency that has rocked several temples. The managers of temples like Kapaleeswarar in Mylapore, Jambukeshwarar Akilandeswari at Thiruvanaikaval in Trichy, Anbil Sri Brahmabureshwarar Temple in Trichy, and Arulmigu Meenakshisundreswarar temple and its 22-sub-temples, however, are reporting to higher officials that sufficient water is available to perform abishekams, sources said. While missing drain network to the temples is a concern, maintenance of existing links to collect rainwater is a top priority now. Last year, HR&CE had renovated 12 tanks by desilting, clearing encroachments, and facilities for inflow of rainwater and overflow channels for surplus water. S Rangarajan, Temple Exnora founding member, said the stormwater drain network to tanks such as Chennakesava Perumal Temple and Kandasamy Temple in Broadway, and Balasubramanya Swamy Temple in Teynampet needs immediate attention given the population in the vicinity and sewage outfall. \u201cLetting sewage into stormwater drains should be made an offence.

A few months earlier, sleuths in Ahmedabad had busted a drone smuggling network and identified that the gadgets were being smuggled from China through Myanmar. Once they reached India, drones were transported through couriers or in domestic airlines, falsely declared as camera stands or electronic items. DRI busts drone smuggling racket in AhmedabadOfficials said these instances point to an illegal influx of Chinese drones into India using the same routes that gold and wildlife smugglers have used over the years. The reason? There has been a huge boom in the drone market with a Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) study estimating it to touch $886 million by 2021 in India. Despite the huge demand, getting a drone delivered in India, through several online marketplaces that source it from China, remains an ordeal. This has led to a flourishing grey market which sells drones at a 40% premium over the market rates. The shops, which risk raids by customs and DRI officials, bypass strict import norms. However, buying a drone in Chennai is not as easy as flying one. A customer needs a middleman as no trader wants to be seen selling it. \u201cYou will get a drone but without a bill,\u201d a middleman told TOI. He said requests for drones pour in regularly and around 15 to 20 are sold every day in the city. To meet this demand, smugglers either falsely declare drones as electronic items, as was found last July when six drone were seized at the airport, or disassemble the gadget to avoid customs, said intelligence officials. Later they reassemble the drone with help from online tutorials. To fly a drone weighing above 250g legally, one needs three permissions. These are issued by the DGCA, the director general of foreign trade, and the wireless planning co-ordination wing of the department of communications. But most drone \u2018importers\u2019 are unaware of this and end up petitioning various customs offices when sleuths impound the gadgets for lack of suitable clearances. Such is the level of ignorance that one techie, when asked to come meet customs officers in Chennai and show relevant clearance documents, said he had a driving licence and Aadhar card! K Senthilkumar, professor at the Centre for Aerospace Research (CASR) and one of India\u2019s foremost drone experts, told TOI that Indian government agencies are not too keen on giving clearances to Chinese drones. \u201cEvery drone has to be operated through a mobile application. For Chinese drones, this app will route the data through a Chinese server. There is a concern that images of the Indian terrain will be stored in China which is seen as a potential security risk. The US army has banned Chinese drones,\u201d he said.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

Discrepancies were found in the results of other subjects as well with students\u2019 marks found to be significantly reduced. Students and teachers of the government, government-aided and constituent colleges of the university have demanded re-valuation and a probe. Controller of Examinations Professor B Senthil Kumar, however, said it was \u201ca minor error\u201d. Such errors occurred only in the practicals for \u2018C Language\u2019, he said. \u201cAfter the results, we have communicated to all the affiliated colleges to give their representations regarding the discrepancies. More than 50% of the colleges have responded. We will rectify it and publish the results in a day or two,\u201d he said, abruptly ending the call when asked about a similar marking pattern in at least three other subjects, including Zoology, Linear Algebra and Real Analyses. When this reporter tried the CoE\u2019s line for further clarification, a staff of the university (Ramesh) attended the call and said the officer had left for \u201can urgent meeting\u201d. Repeated attempts to reach Thiruvalluvar University Vice-Chancellor S Thamarai Selvi failed. Sources in the university said a majority of the students of BSc and MSc mathematics have been given single digit marks in the sixth and fourth-semester examinations respectively. Practical marks in several subjects in other disciplines like BSc Zoology, BSC Computer Science and BCA have also been similar. For instance, 144 of 204 students of Tiruvannamalai Government College and 140 out of 201 students of Cheyyar Government College were awarded 2 or 3 out of 15 \u2018external\u2019 marks in practicals. \u201cThe students have been given identical marks and marked as \u2018RA\u2019 (reappear).

A mathematics professor of a government college, on the condition of anonymity, said none of the 141 students from his college cleared the exam. They have been awarded marks in the range of 0 to 3 in practicals. \u201cMany of the students, who have been maintaining 80% to 90% marks in all the semesters have been given single digit marks, a maximum of 7 out of 75 for the external in two theory papers (Linear Algebra and Real Analyses).

Narendra Modi seems determined to push through the \u2018one nation one election\u2019 (ONOE) policy, tipped to be the first major reform initiative in his second term as Prime Minister. However, moral, legal, political and constitutional hurdles in implementing it remain. The idea first cropped up in the 2017 Republic Day address of President Pranab Mukherjee. During his speech, Mukherjee said the \"time is ripe for a constructive debate on electoral reforms and a return to the practice of the early decades after Independence when elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies were held simultaneously.\" More importantly, he went on to remark that \"it is for the  Commission to take this exercise forward in consultation with political parties\". If Prime Minister Narendra Modi had listened to the words carefully, he would have understood the constitutional complexities involved. What Mukherjee was alluding to was that while the policy proposal may be that of an elected government, it cannot be implemented without adhering to appropriate constitutional processes. In other words, there cannot be any interference with the electoral processes in our country except under the sole aegis of the Election Commission of India \u2014 an autonomous body tasked with the conduct of elections. Therefore, this begs the question about how the PM, as leader of the Union government, has called for a meeting to discuss a fundamental and structural change to the electoral processes. Tuesday\u2019s meeting, therefore, stands at odds with the powers vested with the ECI under Article 324 of the Constitution. Even the power of a sovereign parliament to make laws relating to elections under Article 327 cannot be exercised in violation of basic constitutional principles such as federalism. Herein, lies the greatest political challenge to the ONOE policy. States and regional parties have repeatedly felt hard done by various initiatives of the Modi government. The Finance Commission\u2019s new terms of reference, implementation of the goods and services tax and various issues involving appointments and actions of the governors have been considered as calculated assaults on the federal structure of the country\u2019s polity. Assault on Federalism At present, the ONOE policy prima facie impinges upon federal principles as is apparent from its title. The assumption by the present government that the nation is \"one\" and therefore, requires only one election is logically fallacious. The nation consists of sovereign legislatures whose terms have been granted constitutional protection under Article 172. Like Parliament, the state legislatures \"shall continue for a period of five years from the date appointed for its first meeting\". At present, there is no common date for first meeting of the state legislatures and therefore, any effort to modify this would be anti-constitutional. Moreover, when the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, in landmark cases such as Golak Nath vs State of Punjab and Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala that federalism constitutes the basic structure of the Constitution, the federal institutions such as state legislatures cannot be treated like they are subservient to the Union executive. The whims and fancies of one political party or government must not gain precedence over settled constitutional and legal principles. No practical reasons While those who support ONOE have argued that it reduces costs and time spent on conducting elections, the policy seems to be shortsighted and untenable. The NITI Aayog, in a paper published in 2018, has looked at the merits of the proposal but it has failed to critically evaluate the political repercussions of such a move. The Law Commission, in its 170th Report in 1999 as well as the Parliamentary Standing Committee on personnel, public grievances, law and justice, in its 79th Report in 2015 has looked at the issues surrounding ONOE closely. The Law Commission Report is non-committal but insists that state governments must be consulted by the Election Commission of India before taking any decision. The Parliamentary Committee Report provides a roadmap for holding simultaneous elections in two stages but fails to address how this roadmap will overcome existing legal hurdles. Without seriously addressing the concerns of federalism, independence of the ECI and non-consultation of state governments, the present proposal appears to be a political misadventure that will cause irrevocable damage to the constitutional foundations. It also runs the risk of being seen as a purely gimmick that is rich in optics but without any scientific or statistical basis. As such, the ONOE reform as a threat to the principle of federalism and it paves the way for India to be redesigned and retrofitted as an unfederal, unitary state.

On Monday, Stanley medical college and hospital authorities alerted Ennore police that D Senthil, who is known on the streets of Ennore as \u2018Sudusoru\u2019 Senthil has been admitted with bullet injuries. A team led by inspector inquired Senthil, during which he revealed that he was shot with a pistol on June 8 by two men. \u201cAround 2pm on June 8, Senthil saw P Ramesh, 33, and J Alexander, 32, from Ennore, arguing with Deva of the locality and had intervened. Infuriated over this, Ramesh, who had a pistol with him, opened fire, putting a bullet in Senthil\u2019s hip,\u201d said police. Since Ramesh threatened Senthil not to go to police, the latter had stayed at home but went to the hospital after 10 days since the pain became unbearable. Based on Senthil\u2019s inputs, police registered a case and arrested Ramesh and Alexander on Tuesday and seized the pistol and two bullets from them. After examining the weapon and interrogating the accused, police said Ramesh had bought the pistol in Maharashtra four years ago for his \u2018own safety\u2019 as he expected an attack by a rival gang. \u201cHe had bought the gun through Rafiq, whom he met in Puzhal prison. Rafiq had asked Ramesh to meet his brother Syed in Sowcarpet to secure the weapon. As soon Ramesh came out of prison, he approached Syed and got the gun,\u201d an investigating officer said. Ramesh has two murders and five attempted charges pending against him, while Alexander has one attempted-murder case against him.

After educating one girl student during 2017-18, the school was temporarily closed because of zero enrolment. Rajeshwari, a worker at a tea estate at Chinnakallar, wanted to admit her six-year-old son Shiva to the nearby school, but was upset as the school in her locality was closed and the Adi Dravidar Welfare School at Periyakallar was 4km away. She requested the officials to reopen the school and admit her son, and, much to her astonishment, the officials accepted her request. \u201cShiva was admitted in Class I on Monday based on a request from his mother. I was given additional duty to take care of the school and teach the kid.

As the news went viral on social media, the school modified its stance. \u201cA sump to store water is being constructed and students were told to not to come because of safety reasons,\u201d said S Mary Immaculate, headmistress and correspondent. RKD Fomra Vivekananda Vidyalaya, a private CBSE school in Chrompet, has sent text messages to parents informing them that the school will function only for half-aday. \u201cThis school will function between 8am and 12.15pm from June 24 for all classes due to scarcity of water,\u201d read the message. Principal Indra Shankar refused to comment and said. \u201cIt is a decision by the top management.\u201d Many schools have temporarily shut kindergarten sections saying that children will not be able to handle the heat. This included Jaigopal Garodia School in West Mambalam. Asked about this at a press meet on Tuesday, school education minister K A Sengottaiyan said providing water to students is the responsibility of the school managements and some have been collecting money to get water tankers.

The state is set to sign MoUs for fresh investments of more than Rs 3,500 crore in these sectors in the next few weeks. The bulk of new investments is in establishment of free trade warehousing zones (FTWZs) near Chennai. With China hit by US tariffs, manufacturing companies are looking at Vietnam and India for setting up new manufacturing units. \u201cGiven TN\u2019s strong presence as a manufacturing hub, the state is poised to attract more such investments, since India also has an added advantage of a large domestic market,\u201d sources in the state government told TOI. While Venkatesh COKE will establish an FTWZ at an investment of around Rs 1,500 crore, DP World put up Rs 1,000 crore for its FTWZ. While MM Forgings is scouting for a suitable location for investing around Rs 500 crore for making auto components, another company, Shreevari Energy Systems, will invest close to Rs 250 crore in a wind turbine manufacturing facility at Tuticorin. On the textiles and apparels front, PKPN group of mills and Ambika Cotton Mills are investing more than Rs 550 crore for their new facilities in Namakkal and Dindigul respectively. Following the Tamil Nadu government\u2019s sector- and country-specific focus for creating zones to attract fresh investments, Japan is fast emerging as a key source of new investments. While One Hub Chennai, a next generation industrial township jointly developed by Ascendas-Ireo beyond Tiruporur, has already become a hub for Japanese companies, a new industrial park, Origins, promoted by Sumitomo-Mahindra in north Chennai is set to become the second cluster for Japanese investments. Japanese conglomerate Yanmar, a leading global manufacturer of diesel engines for a wide variety of sectors including agriculture, is already setting up an engine plant for Rs500 crore at Origins. \u201cAnother Japanese company, Nissei Electric, will soon come on board with an initial investment of Rs80 crore for electrical parts manufacturing,\u201d sources said. Realizing the potential that Japan holds for new investments into Tamil Nadu, the state government too has gone out of its way. While only state-owned Sipcot developed industrial parks hitherto enjoyed 50% stamp duty exemption, for the first time Sumitomo-Mahindra\u2019s Origins was accorded that exemption. \u201cWith Tamil Nadu Business Facilitation Act and single window clearance in place, the state has become very proactive in attracting investments,\u201d a state government official said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The film is set to release in about 100 screens across Tamil Nadu this Friday. While the move is in keeping with the trend witnessed over the past few years in the Tamil film industry that started with \u2018Karnan\u2019, unlike a few other old films that had a rerun digitally, \u2018Vasantha Maaligai\u2019 will not be competing for space in run-down theatres, but in multiplexes like Sathyam and Escape, as well as AGS and S2, with reservations opening on Wednesday. \u201cOur family is full of Sivaji fans. As a result, I became his fan at the age of 14, even though I watched other films. I wanted to show my fondness for Sivaji and was searching for the right film of his to be remastered digitally. Veteran director V C Guhanathan helped me get the rights for \u2018Vasantha Maaligai\u2019,\u201d says Shirdi Sathya Sai Films\u2019 P Nagaraja, who owns Groupcom Systems that offers data and voice communication services. Originally made in 35mm, the film has been remastered in Di colour, besides other technology upgrades including DTS, 4K Sony and 2K Qube. \u201cWe also had a fresh trailer and launched it in Chennai\u2019s Sathyam Cinemas on March 29. Despite being a working day, the hall was jampacked,\u201d he said. According to K Chandrasekaran, president, TNCC Arts Wing and Sivaji Social Welfare Association, the film\u2019s producer D Ramanaidu did not sell the satellite rights of \u2018Vasantha Maaligai\u2019 to any television channel. \u201cAs a result, whenever it hit theatres for rerun in its original form, it received a great response. In its digital avatar and technological upgrade, the expectation is much higher, with audience screaming \u2018once more\u2019, at theatres in Karur and other parts of state, when the trailer was played recently,\u201d Chandrasekaran said. Sivaji Ganesan\u2019s \u2018Karnan\u2019, ran to housefull shows when it was digitized about two years ago. Soon, several others joined the fray buying rights of old Sivaji and MGR films for digital mastering and reruns. \u201cOnly \u2018Karnan\u2019, in digital format, turned out to be a commercial hit due to its content and great music.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

Only one well had gone dry in June in 2016 and 2017. Rain Centre currently monitors 88 wells, chosen randomly and grouped into 24 clusters based on the location. \u201cWe created a grid of 1sqkm in the city and identified wells and monitor them every month,\u201d said Shekar Raghavan of Rain Centre. The current situation is a result of water managers in the city, which had ample groundwater since rainwater harvesting structures were made mandatory in 2005, not bothering to revive, maintain or build more such structures, say activists. Metrowater officials say the city has more than eight lakh rainwater harvesting structures, a figure over which activists expressed doubts, but when asked for an audit report, an official said it wasn\u2019t available. Shekar Raghavan said the government and the residents were to blame as neither had ensured maintenance of rainwater harvesting structures (RWHS). \u201cOnce we received good rain in 2005 (2,566mm) resulting in a flood, the city forgot its RWHS policy and began constructing stormwater drains to mitigate floods. The groundwater table remained stable until now. But now that it is crisis time, the government looks back at these initiatives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to write to Metrowater, requesting it to collect information on RWHS structures. A random audit by us in 2017 revealed that 30% of the existing structures were in bad shape and cannot harvest any rain,\u201d he said. Some residents have already begun setting up new RWHS and carrying out repairs on existing ones in preparation for the summer showers as well as the northeast monsoon. Various members of Exnora Greater Chennai and resident welfare organisations said they had been creating awareness for the past seven years regarding RWHS. \u201cThe government should work with activists and NGOs to implement the scheme successfully,\u201d said Dr Sailaja Lokesh, a resident of Ramapuram.

It has not only appointed 17 senior civil servants as \u2018facilitating officers\u2019 and distributed the entire set of large projects among them for follow up, it also added an entirely new dimension to its interaction with the investors. In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the government, through CII, recruited six experienced business professionals for a two-year term to act as \u2018facilitation executives\u2019 between investors and various government departments. While CII recruited these professionals, Tamil Nadu Industrial Guidance Bureau takes care of their \u201cpay\u201d, under an \u201coutsourcing\u201d model. As a result, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, in the next few days, will lay the foundation stone for 14 of those projects, with combined investments of over Rs 2,000 crore, besides inaugurating two smaller projects, which is ready to commence production, according to sources in the Tamil Nadu government. \u201cThe first edition of GIM came under flak due to lower conversion ratio of promised investments into actuals. We understood it was due to lack of steady follow up. Even though \u2018facilitating officers\u2019 were appointed even then, not many projects were followed up,\u201d a state government source told TOI. Of the promised Rs 2.42 lakh crore investments from GIM 1, only around Rs 66,000 crore worth of investments materialized, with energy sector\u2019s dismal show letting down the numbers. In the second edition of GIM this year, 304 MoUs across sectors were signed involving investments of more than Rs 3 lakh crore, resulting in employment opportunities for more than a million. Considering the importance and status of the MoU projects, the government decided and appointed senior officials as \u2018facilitating officers\u2019 to ensure the speedy implementation of projects. It also formed an \u2018Empowered Committee\u2019, headed by Industries secretary, to meet once in two months to review the progress of the MoUs signed in 2019.

But television channels across the country are least bothered about the rules. \u201cParticularly, the \u2018Big Boss\u2019 show hosted by renowned actor Kamal Haasan is being telecast with abusive content only with the view to increase the TRP rating and get monetary benefits without any social responsibility,\u201d he said. Pointing out that feature films are permitted to be screened only after obtaining clearance from the censor board, the petitioner said such contents telecast in television channels do not go through any scrutiny. Claiming that parents and elders are embarrassed and worried as even children are attracted to such shows, the petitioner as an interim measure wanted the court to restrain the television channel from telecasting the show without clearance from censor board. The PIL is likely to be heard by a division bench of Justice S Manikumar and Justice Subramonium Prasad on Wednesday.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "BJP List 2019 Maharashtra": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/two-sitting-mps-from-state-denied-tickets-in-bjps-list/articleshow/68514735.cms", "description": "AURANGABAD/KOLHAPUR: Sitting MPs Sunil Gaikwad (Latur) and Dilip Gandhi (Ahmednagar) were denied tickets for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in the BJP\u2019s first national list of candidates announced on Thursday. The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination. His late grandfather, Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, was long associated with the Congress. | Full coverage of Lok Sabha elections in MaharashtraAmong other prominent leaders from Maharashtra in the first list of candidates are Union minister Nitin Gadkari from his hometown Nagpur, state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve from Jalna, Union MoS Hansraj Ahir from Chandrapur and Union MoS for defence Subash Bhamre from Dhule.

Sitting MP from Sangli Sanjay Patil has also been renominated, putting an end to speculation over any change in constituency. Patil\u2019s candidature was opposed by a section of BJP leaders in Sangli. However, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is understood to have called a meeting of local party leaders and resolved the differences.
