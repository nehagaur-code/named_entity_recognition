You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

Vinod was one among the 13 IAF personnel killed in the military aircraft crash in Arunachal Pradesh on June 3. After a month-long vacation in May, Vinod was eager to fly back to Jorhat airbase in Assam. His cousins dropped him at the Air Force airport here. Once he reached, he sent a text message saying he reached safely. He called his mother again saying that he was raring to join duty. Thangamani's world fell apart when she was informed that the wreckage of the flight her son was in was found and no one survived the crash. Vinod, whose family had settled in Singanallur from Kerala more than a decade ago, was a student of the Kumaraguru College of Technology. Joining the Indian Air Force was a natural progression for Vinod, said his cousin Vijayan. \u201cAs their father was in the defence as an accountant and they were students of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Vinod and his elder brother never had any doubt about their future. Joining the Army, Navy or the Air Force was a natural choice for them. He chose to follow his older brother, who had joined the Air Force during 2008-09,\u201d Vijayan told TOI. Vinod joined the Air Force in 2010-11 and was posted in Kochi, Agra, Jorhat and Sulur stations. He was involved in the IAF\u2019s Kerala flood rescue operations last year. \u201cHe was very fond of his wife, who he had married two-and-a-half year ago and took very good care of his mother,\u201d Vijayan said.

The family is now left with the sweet memories they shared with Vinod during his last vacation last month. \u201cWe watched a few world cup matches together. He was a huge cricket fan. The whole family got together, played music, danced and played card games till 3am. We still can\u2019t believe that he is not with us.

The termination order was issued on Saturday. Panchayat secretary Suresh Kumar, who was working at the panchayat in 2016, was also suspended for failing to monitor and control such activities in his panchayat. A senior official from the district rural development agency (DRDA) said, \u201cIn 2016, Maheshwari was in charge of identifying the households without toilets and assisting the villagers to construct a toilet under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan scheme. Motivator Sathya was in charge of motivating the public to join the scheme. But they had collected Rs 1,500 - Rs 2,000 per house as bribe and promised them to get a government subsidy of Rs 12,000 for each toilet. Believing their words, the villagers constructed the toilets by taking loans. But the villagers never got the government subsidy. All these came out during an inquiry conducted by the BDO after TOI reported about the scam on June 11.\u201d \u201cIt is also proved that the bribe amount - Rs 1.48 lakh - which Maheshwari distributed to 87 villagers on June 13 was her own money and not the incentive amount of Sathya as she claimed. Sathya was dismissed one and half years ago,\u201d the official added. The block co-ordinator and motivator are temporary posts filled by BDO, who has powers to terminate them. In its report on June 11, TOI revealed that over 100 residents of Ichipatti village near Palladam in Tirupur were waiting for the subsidy for more than three years after constructing household toilets by taking loans. Though the original scheme envisages funding \u2013 subsidy of Rs 12,000 per toilet - at various stages of construction, the prospective beneficiaries had to beg and borrow to construct toilets as the officials had only promised to reimburse the expenditure once the facility is ready.

In this year\u2019s \u2018World Continence Week\u2019, which is observed from June 17 to June 23, the theme is \u2018incontinence is no laughing matter\u2019. An overactive bladder (OAB), once considered a medical condition affecting the elderly population, is now being seen among younger men and women. \u201cOveractive bladder is a problem where the bladder-storage functions become impaired, resulting in a sudden urge to urinate. In some cases, the urge may be so strong that it can result in leaks before you can reach the bathroom,\u201d urologist at city-based Vedanayagam Hospital Dr Ganesh Gopalakrishnan said. \u201cIf you\u2019re using the bathroom more than about eight times in 24-hour and if the urge keeps increasing, this could be a sign that there is something wrong,\u201d he said. Some patients, with OAB, experience leakages when they laugh, sneeze or even jump because it puts pressure on the bladder. \u201cMost people who suffer from urinary incontinence live with it because they believe there is nothing they can do about it,\u201d urologist at GKNM Hospital Dr K S Vengetesh said. \u201cHowever, people hesitate to discuss it with doctors due to embarrassment. It often leads to low self-esteem and social isolation,\u201d a doctor said. However, another urologist said patients need to be aware that an overactive bladder is a common medical condition and can be treated or managed well. \u201cWith OAB, the bladder works overtime, contracting more often than it should and at inappropriate times. The bladder muscles seem to give wrong messages to the brain causing the bladder to feel fuller than it is. The bladder contracts too early when the bladder is not very full,\u201d Dr C L Dinakaran of Arun Urology Hospital said. OAB can be managed with lifestyle changes, diet, medication and even surgery. \u201cIt is advisable to limit your caffeine intake, refrain from alcohol and spicy food,\u201d Dr Vengetesh said.

As a result, we used to lose almost half of the plants. Saplings planted near ponds would be submerged during the rainy reasons,\u201d an official said. The survival rate will be high in farmlands, which are fenced and equipped with drip irrigation, the official said. \u201cWhile MGNREGA workers would be used to dig pits and plant the saplings, farmers will water and protect the saplings. We have decided to plant fruit trees like sapota and mangoes and herbal plants in farmlands,\u201d she said. The scheme is expected to attract farmers, who are hesitating to invest in agriculture. \u201cThey need not spend money to buy the saplings and to plant them. DRDA will take care of it. The farmers will get ownership over the plants and can sell the fruits in future. Those interested in the scheme should get in touch with block-level officials,\u201d the official added. DRDA had spent only Rs 1.39crore out of the Rs 2crore allotted to plant saplings near ponds in Avinashi block during 201617. Saplings were not planted near two ponds in Thamaraikulam panchayats due to drought. A lion\u2019s share of the money was used to pay wages to the workers.

A clutch of houses in Chah Pokhar in Achnera block of Agra have turned into graveyards as families are forced to bury their departed in their homes due to lack of a burial ground. As a result, the dead here are a constant part of day-to-day life. TOI found women cooking next to where their children were buried while the elderly rested on cots in a backyard full of graves. In one of the houses, Rinki Begum told TOI that five bodies were buried in her backyard, including that of her 10-month-old son who had died of an untreated fever.

The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village.

They said the population of native cattle breeds, specifically the Malai Kongu Maadu, had dropped drastically after farmers were banned from grazing their cattle in reserve forest zones. They also demanded that the price at which Aavin buys A2 milk from farmers be raised to encourage more farmers to breed and maintain native cow breeds. Farmers, led by the Kongu Patteeshwaran Ghoshala, have requested the collector to make the forest department again issue \u201cpatti passes\u201d to cattle farmers. \u201cThis is a pass that the forest department was issuing to allow us to graze our cattle in forest areas and lands. Around 2000-01, there were nearly 1.5 lakh to two lakh Malai Kongu cows in villages in and around Thondamuthur including Madhampatti, Karadimadai and Viraliyur,\u201d said T Shanmugam a member of the Ghoshala. \u201cHowever, in 2002, when the forest department withdrew our patti passes and banned our and our cattle\u2019s entry into forest areas, many farmers panicked and sold thousands of their native cows to slaughterhouses. We hardly have a few thousand cows of the native breed left,\u201d he said. The farmers said the government should incentivise rearing of native breeds of cattle. \u201cWhile one way is to allow us to graze in forest areas, the other one is to make Aavin buy A2 milk from farmers for at least Rs 50 to Rs 60 per litre. They currently buy it for Rs 20 per litre, which is the cost for A1 milk. They have only one category called milk,\u201d said Shanmugam. \u201cThey should also ban construction on hill area conservation lands and foothills of mountains, because it eventually takes away greenery and open lands which can be used for grazing,\u201d he added. The cattle farmers said that the ban on cattle has affected their environment in multiple ways. \u201cWhenever our cattle used to graze in the forest fringes, wild animals never came out of the forest. We have never seen wild elephants, bears and leopards. Now they have begun coming to our villages,\u201d the petition said. \u201cThe cow\u2019s urine and dung were so beneficial to the soil that the forests were thicker and they used to eat grass so well, that fresh grass kept growing.

The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

The corporation took the stern action after issuing several eviction notices and holding talks with the residents many a times to vacate their houses in the past two years. Town planning officer (TPO) S Ravichandran said, \u201cThere are 252 houses at Jeeva Nagar. We issued eviction notice to all the houses shortly after the Madras high court gave a direction in 2017. Over a period, 132 families moved to the houses provided by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board at Keeranatham.\u201d As the rest of the residents were refusing to vacate their houses and move to alternative accommodation, the corporation suspended the electricity connection, he said. The corporation had earlier demolished the houses of 90 families who had moved to Keeranatham. The high court gave the direction to remove the encroachments based on a writ petition filed by members of KK Pudur Residents Welfare Association. The petitioners contented that the 50-feet link road, which is a part of designated cart road, for over a kilometre stretch is encroached and none of the emergency service vehicles, including ambulance and fire service vehicles, could enter the street because of the encroachment. The legal battle had commenced as early as 2000. \u201cIf the encroachments are removed and the road is developed, it would significantly reduce the traffic congestion in both NSR Road and Kavundampalayam Road in the city as it connects Thadagam Road and Mettupalayam Road,\u201d secretary of the association KKM Selvaraj, who had filed a writ petition demanding the removal of encroachments, said. But residents refused to move out of their houses for different reasons. \u201cThe residents are not encroachers at all. They have been paying a sum between Rs 80,000 and Rs one lakh in installments to the slum clearance board to own the land. In 1990s, the TNSCB has signed a lease cum agreement with the residents.

Likewise, buses to Pollachi and Kerala are using the same routes to reach the destinations.As per the data available with the city police, at least 448 government and private buses use the diversion routes for 2,332 times a day, causing traffic snarls.

A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital.

The award was presented to her by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami in Chennai on Thursday. Divya in chat with Shantha Thiagarajan:What were your priorities when you took charge as the collector of the Nilgiris? When I took charge, one thing that occurred first to me was environmental conservation. I knew that this would be the greatest challenge I would face as the collector. What were the measures you took in the district to conserve environment\u2026?Right now, we have banned sinking borewells and using earthmovers. We have banned plastics which Supriya Sahu had introduced during her tenure here as collector. But over the years, its momentum has slowed down. We have now implemented it seriously. What do you think of the \u2018Green Award\u2019 bestowed on you by the government?I indeed dedicate the award to the people of the Nilgiris. With so much of involvement and cooperation, the people made it happen. Because an order is easy to pass but the people\u2019s participation in this task is tremendous. Without their active support and cooperation, I don\u2019t think this would have become possible at all. I think the sense of belonging of the people here matters a lot. About the transformation in the Nilgiris\u2026. The transformation we see in the district is because of the people. We pass an order and enforce it. The entire cooperation comes from the people. The only thing that I have in my mind is no further degradation should be allowed in the hills during my tenureWhat next for the Nilgiris..?Higher-level planning needs to be there. It should be different from other hill stations. A special status should be there about its fragile ecosystem. I have realized that given its significance, the Nilgiris cannot have the same conservation plans that other hill stations have You mean fresh policies to be enacted\u2026?Policy is in place. For example, in a place where the gradient is more than 33 degrees, constructions should not happen. But still people manipulate the gradient or the identified vulnerable areas and apply for building license. If the applications are rejected, they might go for unauthorized constructions. Manpower here is limited to check illegal constructions. But we try our level best to maintain that discipline here. With revenue and forest departments, may be, a force could be created to check illegal constructions.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh.

Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The process of sorting out the books, numbering them and dispatching to libraries would take around six months, he added. The state directorate of public libraries had not called for library orders from publishers for the past four years citing fund crunch. Recently, they had called for library orders of books published in 2016-17, said officials at the library. Books from 142 English publishers and 517 Tamil publishers had been called for and the publishers have been sending the books to district central libraries across the state. Earlier publishers had been asked to send specimen copies to the directorate. Selected books would be delivered to district central libraries in the state by publishers themselves, said officials.

Activists have petitioned the city corporation officials, urging them to take immediate steps to retrieve the land. The layout was formed in 1988 with 21 plots. About 10% of the total layout area - i.e., 28.37 cents - was reserved to create a park site, as per the directorate of town and country planning (DTCP) approval. As per the Town and Country Planning Act and high court directions, the land reserved as OSR could not be used for any other purpose and none other than the local body could claim ownership of it. But the norms are being violated here, said activist S P Thiyagarajan, who escalated the issue. \u201cThe corporation had regularized the OSR land in 2009 and collected vacant land tax for the property. It, however, issued building approval licence in 2011. The land was then documented in the name of the layout promoter\u2019s brother and later purchased in 2013. But no construction activities were carried out in the plot till date,\u201d he said. The issue came to light only when the promoter fenced the plot in 2018. After the residents lodged a complaint, the city corporation installed a board claiming its ownership, the activist said. \u201cIt is the only open space we have in our layout. If it is turned into a park, it will be useful for us for recreational activities as almost every household has a child,\u201d said B Harisudan, secretary of Ram residency welfare association. Pointing out that the promoter was working to sell the plot, he said the city corporation should take immediate action to retrieve the site and develop it into a park.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The Congress leader hit out at BJP's strategy of playing the nationalist card. \"We are Congress\u2026 we launched the freedom movement\u2026 gave our blood and sweat\u2026 braved British atrocities \u2026 we don't need any certificate to prove our nationalist feelings especially from the ones who apologised to the British at that time\", asserted Priyanka, urging the workers to go to every household in their area and meet every voter. She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022. And once we come, we will stay here for long on the basis of our hard work,\" she said adding that the hard-workers would be adequately rewarded.

They said the population of native cattle breeds, especially the Malai Kongu Maadu, had dropped drastically after farmers were banned from grazing their cattle in reserve forest zones. They also demanded that the price at which Aavin buys A2 milk from farmers should be tripled, to encourage more farmers to breed and maintain native cow breeds. Farmers led by the Kongu Patteeshwaran Ghoshala have requested the collector to make the forest department again issue \u201cpatti passes\u201d to cattle farmers. \u201cThis is a pass that the forest department was issuing to allow us to graze our cattle in forest areas and lands. Around the year 2000-\u201901, there were nearly 1.5 lakh to 2 lakh Malai Kongu Maadu cows across villages in and around Thondamuthur, including Madhampatti, Karadimadai and Viraliyur,\u201d T Shanmugam, a member of the Ghoshala, said. \u201cHowever, in 2002, when the forest department withdrew our patti passes and banned ours and our cattle\u2019s entry in forest areas, many farmers panicked and sold thousands of their native cows to slaughter houses. We have a few thousand cows of the native breed left,\u201d he said. The farmers said the government should incentivize rearing of native breeds of cattle. \u201cWhile one way is to allow us to graze in forest areas, the other one is to make Aavin buy A2 milk from us farmers for at least Rs 50 to Rs 60 per litre. They currently buy it for Rs 20 per litre, which is the cost for A1 milk. They have only one category called milk,\u201d Shanmugam said. \u201cThey should also ban construction on hill area conservation lands and foothills of mountains, because it eventually takes away greenery and open lands which can be used for grazing,\u201d he added. The cattle farmers said the ban on cattle has affected their environment in multiple ways. \u201cWhenever our cattle used to graze in the forest fringes, wild animals never came out of the forest. We have never seen wild elephants, bears and leopards. Now, they have begun coming inside our villages. The grazing cow\u2019s urine and dung was so beneficial to the soil that the forests were thicker, and they used to eat grass so well that fresh grass kept growing. Now we have less greenery and temperature is higher. We have also had to start using chemical pesticides, because we don\u2019t have enough cow urine to make biopesticides,\u201d the petition said.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

But how can small farmers float companies? Where can we go for funds and maintenance of the companies? Instead of asking small farmers to form companies in order to get permission to tap neera, the government should launch collection centres to collect neera from individual farmers. Such centres should be set up in places known for coconut cultivation, such as Pollachi and Sulur,\u201d the union leader said. To set up farmer producer companies, permission is needed from five departments including excise and food safety, Babu said. \u201cIf the government procures neera from us, we will be spared from these procedures. Neera procured from us can be tested in government labs to ensure quality. The model we suggest is similar to the Aavin, where a state-run organisation procures milk from farmers directly.\u201d Currently, the state gives permit to tap neera only to companies, which have set up cold chain facilities. This is to ensure that the drink is stored at 3C. Otherwise it would turn into toddy, which is banned in the state. Four farmer producer companiestwo each in Pollachi and Anaimalai have been given licence to tap neera in the district. Agriculture department officials said that some farmer producer companies in the district are engaged in neera production through the cold chain process. \u201cCoconut farmers can always approach the department to form and register producer companies. The department will provide them support,\u201d an official said.
