A surprise pick by the ruling BJP-led NDA   , Birla's name was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself for the post, sources said. The 56-year-old leader is considered to be close to both Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah. Birla's nomination for the Lok Sabha Speaker's post also has the   backing of non-NDA parties   such as the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). Starting his political journey as a student leader, Birla was also elected to the Rajasthan Assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. He won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was again elected this year from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. Birla defeated Congress's Ramnarayan Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently-concluded general election. A conscientious parliamentarian, Birla has registered an 86-per cent average attendance in the House, asked 671 questions, participated in 163 debates and introduced six private members' bills in the 16th Lok Sabha. From 1991 to 2003, he was a key leader in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) as a state-level president first and then, as a vice-president at the national level. Birla, who holds a Masters degree in commerce, is a member of the Standing Committee on Energy in Parliament, the Committee on Petitions and the Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. He succeeds eight-time MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Lok Sabha Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this is not the first time that a relative newcomer has occupied the position. In 1996, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader G M C Balayogi, also a two-time MP then, was elected as the Speaker in the Lower House of Parliament. After his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

Taxation professionals had protested outside the office of the assistant excise and taxation commissioner (AETC), SK Garg, on Wednesday, claiming that he was not doing any of their works, and was delaying GST refunds deliberately. Shortly after this, the ETO Association issued a statement to the media against the protest and claimed the protest was staged by tax advocates to pressurise the AETC to do their unethical works, and defamatory slogans were made against Garg by the protestors. This statement by the association had angered tax professionals, who then called for a complete boycott of work inside the state taxation office in Ludhiana. Meanwhile, the decision to call of the strike was taken by professionals after a meeting of office-bearers of the District Taxation Bar Association (DTBA) (sales tax) with high-ranking officials of the state taxation department on Tuesday evening at the department\u2019s office in the mini secretariat. Efforts to contact the deputy excise and taxation commissioner (Ludhiana) Pawan Garg and AETC SK Garg proved futile. Meanwhile, speaking to TOI, DTBA secretary Chander Sehgal, former president Arun Kanwal, finance secretary Gaurav Sharma and others, said: \u201cWe have called off our strike today after an apology was tendered by the ETO Association for releasing a baseless statement to the media, in which false accusations were made against us. Today\u2019s meeting was also attended by additional excise and taxation commissioner Gurtej Singh, who has assured us that all pending works in all divisions will be completed soon, and tax-payers and tax professionals will not face any kind of problem. He has also given a time of one month to review the working of the AETC, and also assured us that the entire working in the department will be smooth.\u201d BOX 1 \u2018WE REGRET IT\u2019, SAYS ETO BODY The letter issued by ETO Association, which is signed by its general secretary Harjot Singh, says: \u201cIn a news published in various newspapers on 13.06.2019 in response to the strike by District Taxation Bar Association, it was mentioned that the said strike had been done to pressurise officers for getting their inappropriate works done. In this regard, it is clarified that the said wording was echoed by all the excise and taxation officers of the district Ludhiana-1 in the heat of the moment at that time, but there was no intention of alleging any bar member\u2019s integrity, and the officers, in fact, wanted to express that in such a tense environment, any mistake could happen while disposing of revenue-related work. Nevertheless, as the sentiments of the bar members have inadvertently been hurt, therefore all excise and taxation officers of Ludhiana-1 express the deepest regrets and withdraw the said words.\u201d BOX 2 DTBA TOO ISSUES STATEMENT Later in the evening, DTBA office-bearers acting president Saket Garg, former president Arun Kanwal, finance secretary Gaurav Sharma and others issued a statement to their members saying: \u201cAs you all are aware, there was a strike going on against the poor working and arrogant behaviour of AETC-1, and ETO Association Punjab came forward and stood with AETC-1 and put a false allegation that the motive of the strike was to put pressure on officers and advocates to do their illegal works. DTBA (Sales Tax), Ludhiana took a serious note of this allegation and issued a legal notice to them and filed a complaint against them in Bar Council of Punjab and Harayana. Today, Gurtez Singh, additional excise and taxation commissioner, Punjab DETC Pawan Garg, AETC SK Garg, and office-bearer of ETO Association met bar members of DTBA (Sales Tax), Ludhiana, felt sorry, and issued a press note to that effect, giving an assurance that within one month, AETC-1 will change his working style and sort out the problems of advocates.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The petition was filed in the Punjab and Haryana high court on April 30, by the former DSP\u2019s associate. According to legal experts, the state government was to challenge the court order issued in December last year, in which it had been directed to re-initiate the process of Jaspal\u2019s premature release from jail in the Khalra kidnapping and murder case. Jaspal had moved his premature release case in October 2017, but it was rejected by the Centre in June 2018, saying, \u201cIt is not a fit case for premature release.\u201d After the state government also turned down his case in August last year, Jaspal moved the high court in November and managed to get an order quashing state government\u2019s decision against his premature release. The court also directed the state government to initiate the process of his release after consultation (not consent) with the Union government. It said if the government failed to take a decision in this regard within four weeks, Jaspal should be released on temporary parole. In April this year, Jaspal filed his surety bonds and secured his temporary parole, but was detained in another case of custodial death by the Nabha jail superintendent. Following this, Jaspal\u2019s associate filed a habeas corpus in HC, saying he (Jaspal) was kept in illegal custody by the Nabha jailer. Jaspal\u2019s counsel contended before the court, that he (Jaspal) was convicted in the Khalra murder case and faced life imprisonment and was also convicted in another custodial death case in which he was awarded five years in jail. He said both the terms were to run concurrently and that Jaspal had completed the term for custodial death while being granted temporary parole by HC in the Khalra murder case. Nabha open jail superintendent Sucha Singh said the matter was in the notice of senior officials of the jails department. \u201cI have put all the facts before my seniors and they had taken note of the same,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, legal expert Sukhjinder Singh said since the case had been decided by the CBI court and later upheld by the Supreme Court, the decision to release Jaspal could not have been taken without the consent of the Union home department. He said even if the HC had granted him temporary parole and asked the government to re-initiate the case of his premature release, the state government could have filed a review petition in the court.

For cleaning, the 200 square yards of plot, the owner would be asked to pay Rs5,000; for 500 square yards plot, it would be Rs10,000; and above 500 square yards, the amount would be Rs25,000. Last year, MC had issued a public notice to residents not to throw garbage in vacant plots, and if such a thing happened, then the owners would have to get the plot cleaned within three days. Also, owners had to ensure garbage was not thrown inside the plots again. However, the warning went unnoticed because after that, civic officials did not conduct any checking in the areas. Roughly, there are over 30,000 vacant plots in the city, and officials blamed lack of staff for not conducting checkings at the ground level. However, it is now proposed that MC should recover charges from the owner, because when they clean the plots, the fuel, machinery, and energy of employees is used. It is to be seen whether F&CC members approve this agenda or not. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said the meeting would take place on Thursday, and the proposal would be discussed with members, after which approval would be given. On the other hand, residents claimed MC had the right to impose penalty only if they were providing facilities. Haibowal resident Harish Batra said: \u201cThere is no facility of door-to-door garbage lifting in the entire city, and private garbage collectors are taking away garbage. But they do not come regularly, so people have to throw garbage inside plots.\u201d A Maya Nagar resident said: \u201cThe owner should not be held responsible for garbage in his plot, as he is not asking people to throw garbage there. It is the responsibility of civic officials to check such people who are throwing garbage wherever they feel like.\u201d PROPOSED RATES * Plot within 200sq yards: Rs5,000 * Plot from 200-500 sq yards: Rs10,000 * Plot above 500sq yards: Rs25,000 Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "time": "2019-06-20 07:03:00", "datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mc-may-impose-service-charges-to-lift-garbage-from-vacant-plots/articleshow/69866168.cms"}, "Movies to watch on New Year's Eve": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/movies-to-watch-on-new-years-eve/photostory/67299074.cms", "description": ""}, "Factory owner run over by train while crossing tracks": {"description": "Ludhiana: Crossing railway tracks from an unmanned crossing proved fatal yet again, as a factory owner was run over by a superfast heading towards Delhi at Gorayan railway crossing in the late evening hours of Monday.

The MLA Pandey has advised the mayor to pay attention towards other constituencies as well. The councillors were unhappy with the delay in completion of their development works and they counted large number of complaints against the officials. The sources revealed that MLA Pandey blamed the civic officials and delay in the works for lesser votes in the MP elections from his constituency. The councillors complained that despite passing of several months to allotment of development works in their wards, the work orders were not issued and contractors did not start the works. The councillors blamed the officials for delay in the process while officials held the contracts responsible for not starting the works. Mayor Balkar Sandhu has issued instructions to cancel the contract and blacklist those contractors who have not started the works till date. Some of the councillors also raised the demand for construction of static compactors in their areas on the pattern of West constituency so that garbage problem in the areas could come to end. However, the mayor gave the plea that static compactors policy has been decided at state government level, but the MLA as well as councillors opposed his statement. MC commissioner Brar however intervened and pacified everybody. The councillors and a few persons accompanying the MLA raised the matter that instead of blacklisting the contractors, MC should see why those contractors were not working. They claimed since MC was not making the payments, the contractors were least interested in completing the works. They asked the officials to recover the pending dues so that development works could take place in the city. The councillors also raised the matter of zonal commissioner Manjit Singh Cheema\u2019 behaviour with councillors when they go to his office for some work. Recently, Cheema had called up a meeting with councillors at zone A office, but officials did not turn up for the meeting and councillors thus left from there without conducting the meeting. Cheema assured that they will be treated with due respect in his office. Meanhwile, MLA Pandey said there were some basic issues which need to be discussed with officers and mayor for which the meeting has been conducted. He added that there were no personal grudges against anyone. Mayor Sandhu said these meetings are conducted on a regular basis so that differences between the councillors and officials could be removed. He said some contractors are not doing their jobs properly and they will be held answerable.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Commissioner of police, while exercising his powers under Section 144 of CrPC 1973, has banned the sale of acid in all areas falling under the jurisdiction of police commissionerate, Ludhiana, for a period of two months. He said it had come to his notice that acid was being sold illegally in areas falling under the jurisdiction of Ludhiana police commissionerate. CP has ordered that no person can sell acid without a proper licence, which he would require to renew from time to time. He said the person selling acid should make sure he maintains complete records such as identity card, voter card, and complete address of the person buying it. He said acid cannot be sold to any person below 18 years of age. He also said the seller would maintain a proper record of stock in a register, and in case of any sale, he would submit the details with the area police station and SDM. As per orders in case of sale of acid to any hospital, industry, government department, or some other departments, etc, then the shopkeeper selling the acid would be himself responsible for collecting complete details of the head of the organization to which the acid was being sold. And the organization buying the acid should themselves ensure acid was stored in a safe place under the supervision of a responsible person. Besides, all details of stock and use of acid should be maintained in a separate register without fail. In another order, the police chief had also banned the operation of hookah bars in all areas under the jurisdiction of Ludhiana police commissionerate. He stated some hookah bars were operating illegally in the city, and they were causing serious harm to our residents, as the hookah contained tobacco and harmful chemicals. Keeping in mind the health of city residents, the commissioner of police had banned all hookah bars in the city. Further, he had imposed a ban on loudspeakers from 10pm to 6am in all areas falling under the jurisdiction of the Ludhiana police commissionerate. He said no person would be allowed to play loudspeakers at high volume from 10pm to 6am. He said when someone plays loudspeakers at high volume, it affects animals, birds, children, senior citizens, and patients. He said in case people want to organise a programme in this time period, then the organizers require permission from the authorities concerned. The commissioner of police has also banned the manufacture of those registration number plates of vehicles that flout the norms. He ordered that if any shopkeeper/painter manufactures an illegal number plate (which is against government rules), then strict action would be taken against them. He said sometimes, the registration number was not written in a proper and clear font, which becomes difficult for police to read. He has also banned the carrying of arms and ammunition in all marriage palaces falling under the jurisdiction of Ludhiana police commissionerate for a period of next two months. He said it had come to his notice that some people were openly carrying arms and ammunition at weddings/functions in marriage palaces, and sometimes in case of an altercation, or under the influence of drugs/liquor, these weapons were used. He said such instances endanger the lives of the common man. He said in case any person enters the marriage palace with arms and ammunition, then the marriage palace owner would himself be held responsible for immediately informing the police station concerned, adding that in case any person used his arms and ammunition in the marriage palace, then legal proceedings would be initiated against the person using the weapon, as well as the marriage palace owner.

In the same period last year, the jail witnessed comparatively less number of cases of scuffle and mobile recovery. As per the data provided by the jail authorities, in the first five months of 2018, six cases of scuffle were reported, 45 mobiles were recovered, 19 cases under the NDPS Act were registered and one murder was reported. The Ludhiana jail hit the headlines on April 10 when an inmate, Livtar Singh, was found dead in a bathroom with a drawstring around his neck. A SIT was formed and it held three inmates guilty of killing Livtar over drugs. In its report, SIT stated that Livtar was a conduit for drugs and intoxicating pills in the jail and he hid them in his private parts. The accused, Sunny Khullar, Shakti and Pritam, killed him when Livtar did not give them the drugs he had brought in his anus. SIT officials said that there were several inmates who were known in the jail by the name \u2018dikki\u2019, which meant a person who brought contraband in his private parts. Jail superintendent Shamsher Singh Boparai said, \u201cMore recoveries of cellphones indicate that the jail authorities have become more vigilant. We are conducting regular surprise checks and in majority of the cases, phones are thrown from outside. About scuffles, I would say people lodged in the jails are criminals and they have a tendency to fight. We keep a vigil, but are short of staff.\u201d When asked about recoveries of drugs and intoxicating pills, Boparai said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have body scanners to catch inmates who insert them in anus.\u201d WHAT AILS JAILS 1) Less security: There are approximately 3,200 inmates in the Ludhiana jail and only 77 security personnel. In 2018, the government had announced to provide 25 CISF personnel, but they have not joined. 2) Need more CCTVs: There are only 64 CCTV cameras installed in the central jail. The superintendent has demanded 200 more. 3) No body scanner: To recover mobiles, drugs and intoxicating pills hidden in body parts, the jail officials need body scanners, each of which costs Rs 3 crore to Rs 4 crore. Jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawan said he has written to the finance department for funds, but the demand has not been approved yet. 4) No counselling: In February last, during the visit of jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, an NGO conducted a survey in the Ludhiana prison with a proposal to start yoga, meditation, counselling and sports activities for the inmates to reduce clashes and suicides. At present, the jail has only one counsellor, who is a woman and inmates hesitate to share their feelings with her.

The wing had found that it was Harpreet Kaur\u2019s first venture into drug peddling. Her brother-in-law was identified as Ramesh Singh. In the second such case around the same time, the Ludhiana rural police had arrested another woman, Raju, from Mandiani village in Dakha after 45 illegal drug tablets were recovered from her. On June 9, the anti-narcotics wing had nabbed woman peddler Surinder Kaur of Gorsian Khan Muhammad along with a male peddler after 24 grams of heroin was recovered from them during a checking at Gorsian Kadar Baksh in Sidhwan Bet. These are not isolated cases in Ludhiana rural areas. The officials of the anti-narcotics wing said women peddlers have become a dangerous emerging trend. Wing in-charge inspector Navdeep Singh said they have arrested about seven women peddlers from various areas under Ludhiana rural jurisdiction in the past two months. He said about 20 of them were on their watchlist. Officials said half a kilogram of heroin was recovered from 15 women peddlers in the past six months. They added that these peddlers were mostly involved in selling heroin and only a few carried drug tablets and poppy husk. An officer of the anti-narcotics wing said most of the women were from families whose men were in the trade and were not able to go out or were in jail. The women were using their men\u2019s network and selling drugs to their customers. Wing officials said about 50% of such peddlers were educated women who knew about drugs and ventured into the trade for easy money. Some of them were addicts as well, they added. BOX Sidhwan Bet the hotbed The anti-narcotics wing in-charge said they have arrested women peddlers from across Ludhiana rural areas, including Dakha, Raikot, Hathur and Jodhan, but most arrests were made from Sidhwan Bet. Why heroin? Wing officials said because of the small size and large profit, heroin peddling was a natural choice for women. They use private parts to carry heroin and police have to work hard to meet the norms of the NDPS Act, as per which a woman constable checks the peddler in closed doors. They said women constables were well trained to check such carriers. Young blood A wing officer said about 80% of women peddlers were in the age group of 20 to 35 years.

As per the prosecution, a police party was patrolling on GT Road near Bardala police post. On seeing the cops, two men on a bike tried to escape. They were, however, chased and nabbed. The bike driver identified himself as Pargat Singh and the pillion rider as Talwinder Singh. During checking, a polythene bag was recovered from them. The bag contained 1,300 tablets of Phenotil. Following the recovery, the two were arrested. During the case trial, the accused pleaded innocence. Additional public prosecutor sought punishment to the two on the basis of prosecution evidence. The defence counsel argued that the two have been implicated. He contended that consent memos were prepared by getting the signature of the accused forcibly, which is against the procedure of law. Turning down the plea of the defence counsel, the court observed, \u201cIt is true that the investigating officer had not joined any independent witness, though recovery had taken place from a busy area. There is nothing on record to show that false recovery had been planted upon them as no previous ill-will or enmity is either alleged or proved.

They said their demand for a graveyard has been ignored for years. The pond in Chah Pokhar village, where a piece of land is allocated for the burial ground on papersThe apathy of the administration can be gauged from the fact that a plot allotted for a graveyard some years ago falls right in the middle of a pond. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears and residents are running out of space. The fresh graves are no more cemented to ensure they occupy less space and stones of different sizes kept over them are the only way to tell them apart. Protests have erupted in the past over the issue. In 2017, after the death of resident Mangal Khan, his family refused to bury his body until land for a graveyard was provided in the village. After assurances by the authorities, they buried Khan near the pond. But the promises came to nothing. Living with the dead: A grave in the backyard\"All we are asking for is some land for our ancestors. There is a cremation ground for the Hindus in the periphery of the village, but we are living with our dead,\" said Munim Khan, a factory worker. Desperate residents even tried reaching out to nearby Sanan village and Achnera town that have burial grounds. But they were not willing to part with precious space. \"These two villages have a larger Muslim population than Chah Pokhar. Their burial grounds are filled to capacity,\" said Nizam Khan, a mechanic. Village pradhan Sundar Kumar said that he had asked officials several times for a burial ground for Muslim families, but no action was taken. Ravi Kumar NG, the district magistrate, said that he was not aware of the issue. \"I will send an official team to the village and get details of the burial land required.\" Picture Credit: Hemant Kumar In Video:Houses turn into graveyards as Muslims in this UP village bury the dead at homeDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Satta Market": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-assembly-polls-satta-market-bets-shift-from-winner-loser-to-seat-tally/articleshow/66726353.cms", "description": "BHOPAL: This assembly  is turning out to be a nail-biter. The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The report will include availability of security guards, installation of CCTV cameras and other necessary arrangements. There are total 14 gun houses and approximately 18,000 licensee weapons in the city. During elections, several weapons were submitted in the gun houses, while others at the respective police stations. As per the owners of the gun houses, nearly 20 per cent people so far have released their weapons till now. DC Ashwani Kapur said summer vacations were on and a majority of people were out of town which was why not much weapons had been released. \u201cAfter the Amritsar incident, I have asked the licensing unit to get a detailed report on security arrangements at the city-based gun houses. The report will include availability of security guards, CCTVs, alarm system and other arrangements. I am hopeful to get the report soon and on the basis of it, further action will be taken.

We don\u2019t earn enough to spend on security. A guard demands at least Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 monthly.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Only 20 per cent people were found taking part in the waste segregation drive on the second day. The drive was kicked off on Monday when the MC commissioner knocked at the doors of the residents and asked them to help the civic body to segregate waste at source. Residents of Joshi Nagar, however, complained to the commissioner about the absence of sweepers in the area. They said sweepers did not come regularly and the streets were not cleaned properly. The commissioner and the councillor assured the residents of getting the area cleaned regularly by sweepers. They, however, said the residents would also have to segregate the waste. The area councillor said: \u201cThe second day was disappointing because people were not segregating waste at their homes despite awareness drives being carried out by the MC.\u201d She said she would continue to work for waste segregation and she had also deputed a team of volunteers in the area for creating awareness among the residents.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the discussions attended by 21 of the 40 parties represented in Parliament - with three more sending written submissions - saw most parties favouring the proposal even as he added that the PM said a decision will be taken by consensus. The meeting saw key absentees such as Congress, Trinamool, BSP, DMK, SP, TDP and AAP. Left parties attended the discussions, but CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the party felt the move was \"anti-federal\" and did not support it and it went against accountability of governments. CPI leader D Raja said the proposal was \"impractical and unconstitutional\" and would need major constitutional changes. Leaders who attended the meeting included NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI's D Raja, Bihar chief minister and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar, SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, Odisha chief minister and BJD leader Naveen Patnaik and National People's Party leader Conrad Sangma. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference's Farooq Abdullah also attended the meeting. Pawar is understood to have said the proposal would take time to implement and was not a simple matter. Mehbooba and Abdullah are also understood to have pointed out problems in ensuring simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha polls. BJP ally Shiv Sena was absent as Wednesday was the Foundation Day of the party with a function organised in Mumbai. Among important non-NDA leaders, Patnaik supported the proposal as did YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy. TRS was represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao's son KT Rama Rao, who said the proposal needs more detailed examination before a decision can be arrived at. \"The PM will form the committee to look into possibilities of simultaneous polls. Exact nature of the committee will be made public later,\" Singh told the media. He said the committee will give its suggestions on the subject in a time-bound manner and quoted the PM as saying that \"One Nation, One Election\" was not an agenda of any party but of the nation and that political parties should consider the larger interest of the country. Modi said all parties will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision and differences of opinion will be taken into account with full seriousness. \"Most parties gave their support, CPI(M) and CPI had a difference of opinion but they didn't oppose the idea, just the implementation of it,\" Singh claimed. \"We had invited 40 political parties, out of which 21 parties participated and three other parties sent their opinion on the subjects in writing.\" BSP chief Mayawati tweeted on Tuesday morning saying she would have attended the all-party meeting if it was on electronic voting machines (EVMs). Besides simultaneous polls, the PM had invited heads of political parties to discuss several issues, including celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. Last August, the Law Commission recommended simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money. The draft said, \"Holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.\" The panel recommended amendments to the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act to ensure simultaneous elections. The law panel as well as a group of senior officials set up by Modi in his first term had suggested that elections can be synchronised in two phases. The next Lok Sabha election could see states due to go to polls within six months before or after national polls brought together. The remainder states could be brought into the fold in the subsequent the Lok Sabha polls. Lack of consensus ensured the proposal never got off the ground. It now appears that Modi is using his fresh majority to give the proposal another strong push by kick-starting a discussion.

Six visually handicapped youngsters went to a camp in Bengaluru from June 10 to 19. This camp was organized by private institution Cabi (Cricket Association for the Blind in India), which is the apex body conducting cricket for the blind across India, having inherited the responsibility in 2010 from the former Association of Cricket for the Blind in India. \"Cricket is an emotion for me, and I am very much blessed that the experience in the last days of the camp was unmatchable and indescribable. It\u2019s my first time being a part of this camp, and I felt really good, as I have learnt a lot of things in cricket, which will help me in the future. I am really thankful to Cabi who organizes such camps for people like us. It gives us hope and courage, that even though we are blind, people are coming forward and understanding our needs,\u201d said Rohit (19) from Ludhiana. Vishal (22), also from the city, said: \u201cI was always fond of cricket, and being in this kind of camp gives me extra hope and courage that I can be a good sportsman. Here, I have practised batting, bowling, and fielding. In the past few days, I have seen a positive change in me, as I know I am better at all these activities because of my hard work and dedication. It's my first time in Bangalore, and I am really happy, and wish to be here next year also, to learn some new techniques and things which will help me in the future.\u201d \u201cThe weather in Bengaluru makes me energetic, as from the first day itself, I was feeling very good. The daily routine there started in the early morning, where all our mates get ready for practice. The sessions start from 10am and end at 4.30pm. Believe me while we practise and play, I don\u2019t think about anything else. It\u2019s the best feeling, and one of the best moments of my life,\u201d said Jagseer Singh (18) from Ludhiana. Anoher city-based blind cricketer Mangal Singh (22) said: \u201cCricket is one of the most important things of my life. I was very excited to be in the garden city. In fact, the excitment began right when I boarded the train to Bangalore. I am so happy to be a part of this camp. Only our train journey we paid for, but everything else there was free of cost, sponsored by Cabi. I am happy to see there are associations like Cabi who are here to help us. I will miss these days and moments.\u201d Mandeep Singh (21), another city lad, said: \u201cIt took us about two days in the train, but it was worth the wait, as I was going to learn some new tips and tricks which will improve my game. Everything in the southern city was so well organized and it felt so good just being there. We used to have breakfast in the morning around 7.30am, lunch between 1-2 pm, and finally dinner every night at 8pm. Every person there was working with so much cooperation, which made me feel I was at home itself. I improved my skills in fielding and bowling, which I wanted to improve for a very long time.\u201d \u201cAlthough this camp was about cricket, there was another special thing which I personally felt good about, and that was we also had computer classes. I always wanted to try computers, and so I learnt many things here which will help me in future. It was necessary to learn these things like booking an airplane ticket, bus ticket, train ticket, movie ticket, etc. They also taught us how to use tablets. There was a one-hour class from 5-6pm, after the cricket practice. Our days there were full of learning and joy. It was my first time in that place, but I am sure I will come next time too,\u201d said Sandeep Kumar (22) from Ludhiana.

Low and middle-income countries shoulder much burden of COPD and it is a major public health problem in India. However, current prevalence pattern of COPD in India is not well understood. The study on COPD in the industrial town of Ludhiana in Punjab, where one of the leading risk factors was found to be air pollution, was conducted by Arun Sharma, Narinder Kumar Saini, Harshita Kelkar of department of community medicine, University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi and Om Prakash Kalra, vice-chancellor of Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma, University of Health Sciences, Rohtak. The outcome of the study which was started in 2011 has been made public recently. Studies carried out in small geographical areas can help to determine the local prevalence and locally existing risk factors of a disease. In this study, all households were screened in each of the identified colonies using a structured questionnaire for identifying probable cases of COPD based on the Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease criteria and then confirmed by spirometry. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee for Human Research of the University College of Medical Sciences.  \u201cResidential colonies were identified in an industrial and non-industrial area and all households were screened for COPD using the Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease criteria and confirmed by spirometry. Information about exposure to possible risk factors was also collected from suspected cases of COPD. Cases were mapped on a digital map of the city and hotspots were identified. As a result, 56 cases of COPD were detected. More than half (71%) were in the industrial area. The overall prevalence rate of COPD in the city was 3.17 per 1000. The highest prevalence (5.6-9.4 per thousand) was observed in the colonies of the industrial area. All surveyed colonies in the non-industrial area showed a low prevalence (0.0 to 0.9 per thousand),\u201d Dr Sharma told TOI. He further added that spots of COPD were located in the industrial area and there was no such aggregation in the non-industrial area. The study mentioned that smoking and ambient air pollution are major risk factors for COPD. For the purpose of establishing associations, longitudinal studies are required to examine levels of PM2.5, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide with real-time data along with incidence data of COPD. A strength of the present study is that it provides important baseline data as there are no previously published community-based studies showing the prevalence of COPD in Ludhiana. Besides the geographical factors, they also found socio-economic determinants. \u201cPoor people or workers who lived in an industrial area were living in a polluted environment. Owing to their financial constraints, they most of the time live in poorly ventilated rooms, especially women suffering the most by inhaling the smoke arising from cooking with wood and coal as fuel in these dingy houses. They also lack a good nutritional diet to keep the diseases at bay. These factors further augment the risk of diseases in the population in industrial pockets than those in non-industrial, \u201c Dr Sharma added. As the poor people find it difficult to bear the treatment expenditure, he recommended that the governments to come forward in extending subsidy benefit for the payment of insurance premium which is likely to go high for the pre-existing diseases, making it difficult for poor people to pay. No insurance scheme to cover healthcare of people suffering from various diseases due to air pollution, barring cancer, \u201d said Ved Pal, LIC development officer, Chandigarh.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, where most of the patients have been undergoing treatment since the disease spread, struggled to handle the spate of new admissions with its limited infrastructure. Sources at the hospital said the stream of high-profile visitors, including the chief minister and the Union health minister, was adding to the chaos. The scarcity of beds and doctors continued even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital. \"All 637 beds, including 30 in the paediatric ICUs, are occupied. We have had to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\" SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there was a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \"Though there is a shortage, it is inhuman to turn away patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES have been coming every day, but our resources are very limited.\" To ease the crisis, a makeshift paediatric ICU with 20 beds and four new ACs was set up on Wednesday. But frequent power cuts hampered the efforts. The Hhospital authorities said 154 children were undergoing treatment for AES at three paediatric ICUs with 10 beds each. In Vaishali, civil surgeon ID Ranjan said 15 suspected cases of AES had been reported from Hajipur. \"Several kids have died in the villages there. Some have died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. Their relatives say they had high fever and convulsions, among other symptoms indicative of AES.\" At least three of seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital in Samastipur were referred to the SKMCH. One of them died on the way. But civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied that any AES patient had been admitted at the Sadar hospital. In Banka district, the death of a two-year-old in a village in Katoria block has caused alarm. Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \"The number of children admitted with AES symptoms since June 1 has gone up to 5,530. Till Wednesday, 187 kids were discharged after treatment while 101 of them are still under the care of the two main medical institutions in the district. The condition of 24 children is critical. All of them are on ventilators,\" Ghosh said. \"A massive awareness campaign has started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekas. Executive magistrates have been deployed in every block to monitor the awareness programme, apart from keeping a close vigil on the patients with AES.\" Neighbouring Ranchi is also in the grip of an AES scare, with anxious parents taking their children to hospitals at the slightest hint of any symptom associated with the disease. Nisha Devi, a mother of two daughters aged six and four, said: \"Both my daughters have been running a fever for two days. Though the paediatrician I visited advised rest and prescribed a few medicines, I insisted on complete blood tests for both to rule out AES.\" Standing in a line with his four-year-old daughter at Ranchi Sadar Hospital, Jagatram, a worker in an electronics shop, looked and sounded worried. \"I brought her here because she was running a temperature all night. With so many kids dying in Bihar, I cannot take any risk,\" said the father of two. District civil surgeon BV Prasad told TOI that the Ranchi administration would release guidelines for AES awareness to quell the panic and confusion. \"It is a good thing that parents are alert. Although this means long queues in the paediatric departments, chances of a case going undetected are minimised. We will be releasing a communique informing people about AES and its symptoms. Fever, vomiting and convulsions - all three symptoms are generally connected with AES and parents of small kids experiencing even one of those should consult a doctor,\" he said. Times ViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shoot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicenter. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.(With inputs from Debjani Chakraborty in Ranchi)Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Sushmita Sen": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/sushmita-sen-shares-adorable-moments-with-daughters-from-brother-rajeev-sens-wedding/videoshow/69863882.cms", "description": ""}, "Asus 6Z": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/asus-6z-to-launch-in-india-today-heres-how-to-watch-the-live-stream/articleshow/69851301.cms", "description": ""}, "Captain, Sukhbir, AAP seek action against Delhi cops": {"time": "2019-06-18 06:44:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/capt-sukhbir-aap-seek-action-against-delhi-cops/articleshow/69832958.cms", "description": "JALANDHAR: A day after a Sikh auto driver and his minor son were beaten up with lathis by at least five men of Delhi Police, parties and politicians in Punjab sought action against the cops involved on Monday.

Youngsters and people frequenting the market almost on a daily basis have been complaining about hiked parking rates there. On an average, around 1,500 cars are parked in the parking lot on a daily basis. A team of MC officials checked the parking site on April 22, where it was found that employees were not wearing the uniform or even reflector jackets as supposed to. Neither were they able to produce their identity cards, nor where they carrying e-ticket machines. At the entrance and exit points of the parking lot, CCTVs were not installed. Despite the contractor being given a notice on May 13 and being asked to give a clarification, the civic officials did not receive any reply.

MC commissioner Brar said, \u201cA proposal has been prepared for the cancellation of the agreement and the final decision will be taken in the meeting on Thursday.\u201d She said the MC is planning to run these parking sites at their level in future, and a system is being prepared in this regard.
