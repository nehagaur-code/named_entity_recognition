Increasing incidents of crocodile attacks and straying into human settlements have forced the forest department to \u2018detain\u2019 them in Pavagadh and scout for tourism potential as well. According to chief conservator of forests (CCF), Vadodara division, S K Shrivastav, it has been decided that stray reptiles will now be bundled off to a unique \u2018Kala Pani\u2019 carved out of an abandoned quarry of blacktrap in the Dhobi Ghat area. \u201cIt will be spread over one hectare. The place is 54km from Vadodara city,\u201d he said. The step may bring respite to those in Vadodara city and villages along the Charotar belt who usually see these reptiles lurking in water bodies in their vicinity. Today, there are close to 250 crocodiles in Charotar belt and 300 in Vadodara city. The work on creating the unique habitat has already begun and it will be ready in two months. \u201cThe area will house more than 100 crocodiles,\u201d said Shrivastav. \u201cThe forest department usually releases the rescued crocodiles. Now, they will be released in this zone. There are 37 such abandoned mines that can be exploited for similar purposes,\u201d said deputy conservator of forests Anshuman Sharma. What has prompted the move is the gradual increase in incidents of human-reptile conflicts. In Vadodara, citizens may have made peace with these jawed reptiles, but Vishwamitri river has witnessed crocodile attacks at Sama lake and Asoj lake where five lives were lost in 2014. In 2017, two injuries were reported in Vishwamitri river, while in the following year, three injuries were recorded there. \u201cPeople in the Charotar belt have learnt to live with crocodiles, which is not the case in Vadodara city,\u201d said former Wildlife Institute of India (WII) member B C Choudhry. The growing attacks are also being reasoned to the growing number of crocodile population. These reptiles are highly territorial, making them more prone to attacks. The 2015 census had revealed presence of over 260 crocodiles in the 25km stretch of Vishwamitri river that passes through the heart of Vadodara. In the Anand-Charotar belt, 58 crocodiles were sighted at Deva village in Anand district. After Deva, the maximum number of crocodiles (38) were sighted in the two water bodies of Heranj, followed by 28 and 25 in Traj and Dabhou villages.

Uncertainty loomed large over their kin as most of the deceased were sole breadwinners for their families. The incident took place at Hotel Darshan on Dabhoi-Vadodara state highway between 12 midnight and 12.30 am. One of the workers had entered the tank for cleaning it but fell unconscious. T he remaining workers went inside one after the other to save the others, but all of them ended up suffocating to death.  Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services uses an earthmover to widen the mouth of the tank to recover the bodiesThe hotel owner, Hassan Abbas Bhoraniya, was booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and violation of Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act and Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. He is absconding, said police. Meanwhile, the Gujarat government announced a financial assistance of Rs 4 lakh each to the kin of all the deceased. In a statement, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said that he has directed the police to take strict action against the hotel owner. Workers died of suffocation due to high gas pressureThe seven deceased include Ashok Harijan (45), his son Hitesh Harijan (23), Mahesh Harijan (25), Mahesh Patanwadiya (47), Vijay Chaudhary (22), Sahdev Vasava (22) and Ajay Vasava (22). While Ashok, his son Hitesh, Patanwadiya and Mahesh Harijan were called for cleaning the septic tank, Chaudhary, Sahdev and Ajay were housekeeping employees at the hotel and were assisting them. Ashok was the first to enter the tank and had removed some of the dirty water using a bucket. But when the rope tied to bucket broke, he went further inside the tank to bring out the bucket. After going a little deep, Ashok got affected by the poisonous gas and shouted for help. On hearing that, Ashok\u2019s son Hitesh entered the tank but fell unconscious. When the fatherson duo did not come out Mahesh went inside followed by the three housekeeping staff of the hotel. Patanwadiya, a farmer, who had come only to carry the dirt in his tractor also entered the tank to rescue the six others, but he too fell victim to the poisonous gas. As all seven of them went missing, a couple of boys who had accompanied the workers called the hotel staff who in turn informed the Dabhoi municipality and local police. Since the municipality did not have necessary equipment, they sought help from Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services. \u201cAll seven died of suffocation as the pressure of gas was high in the tank,\u201d said Vadodara fire officer Nikunj Azad. The mouth of the tank was so narrow that firemen had to widen it using an earthmover to bring out the bodies. Once the bodies were removed, a suction tank vehicle of Vadodara Municipal Corporation cleaned the tank. \u201cWe had sent teams to the hotel owner\u2019s home in Bharuch and native Siddhpur, but he was not found at any of the locations,\u201d said deputy superintendent of police K V Solanki. The practice of manual scavenging that is banned by law, however, continues in Gujarat and has reportedly claimed 180 lives since 1993, claimed social activist Parshottam Vaghela. Earlier this year, five sanitation works have died of suffocation after entering manholes or septic tanks in separate incidents in Ahmedabad. In 1993 Union government had enacted the law prohibiting manual scavenging and in 2013 amended it to The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act- 2013. Between 1993 and 2013 at least 141 manhole workers have died after entering gutter or sewers, as per figures obtained under the RTI Act. Between 2014 and 2019 37 deaths of manhole workers have been reported, added Vaghela. Enraged over the incident Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra twitted, \u201cEnough.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Meena had sought bail from a sessions court here on the grounds that he had no involvement in the case as he was just performing duties as the branch manager yet he had been booked in the case. He also told court that the FIR was registered after over a year since the alleged crime was committed and even during his police custody period, cops did not find any evidence of his involvement. In response to his bail plea, the additional public prosecutor Ramesh Gianchandani argued before the court that Meena was hand-in-glove with the key accused Joshi. \u201cAs the branch manager Meena had the authority to clear the cheques after verifying the signatures whenever it came for withdrawals, but he allowed withdrawals even when the cheques had signature of only one partner thus his involvement is evident,\u201d said Gianchandani. The court of additional sessions judge A A Nanavati upheld the arguments and turned down Meena\u2019s plea. The court while rejecting the application observed that it is a case where a protector helps the thief and if he will be allowed bail the public trust on the banking system will not remain.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar.

Gujarat has earned the distinction of disposing of maximum number of cases pending for the past 10 years. According to the data of National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), the lower courts in the state together disposed of 3,68,762 cases between 2015 to 2018. In the same period, All subordinate courts across the country had disposed over 12 lakh such cases during the same period. Uttar Pradesh was the second fastest in speedy disposal by clearing 2,68,465 cases. In fact, the disposal rate of cases in the state has been consistently high for the last four years. High court officials said that the high rate of disposal of old cases is mainly due to different initiatives taken. Regular meetings and monitoring of judicial officers at district level helped in bringing down the pendency rate of more than a decade-old cases. At district levels too meetings are held with lawyers to impart training and sensitization so that the old cases are not dragged for long. \u201cThe national lok adalats also help a lot in disposing the old cases,\u201d an official said. In fact, in April this year the Union law and justice ministry had lauded the state for high disposal rate of cases which are older than 10 years. A joint secretary of the ministry had written a letter of appreciation to the registrar of Gujarat high court as four district courts had ranked among the top 10 subordinate courts in the country that had disposed such cases in March. The high court registry had sent several suggestions to the ministry so that other states can too increase the disposal rate of such cases. As of now, the cases which are pending for over 10 years stand at 2,19,553, which is lower than Uttar Pradesh \u2013 9,63,538 \u2013 Bihar (3,98,118), West Bengal (2,94,858) among other states. According to the NJGD figures, the pendency of old cases in Gujarat is mostly waiting for presence of important witnesses or due to stay by a district court or high court. Another reason is also because of heavy pendency in court due to which time cannot be given to certain cases. Last year, courts in Ahmedabad district had disposed of maximum number of cases \u2013 28,679 \u2013 in the state, followed by 21,786 cases of Vadodara district, 8,319 cases of Surat district, 6,242 cases of Rajkot and 5,873 cases of Jamnagar.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The project was earlier planned under the Pradhan Mantri Aavas Yojana (PMAY) and work order was also issued for it. The VMC had planned to take up work on four different plots in Gotri by razing 349 dwellings there. These were clubbed together under a single project that was to be taken up as a PPP project under PMAY. Manav Infrastructure Pvt Ltd was identified as the developer for the project after a tendering process. The developer was to construct 349 houses for rehabilitation of slums along with 149 other houses for the urban poor besides seven shops. As a premium towards the project, the developer was to make an additional 199 houses at the site. Of the 345 slum dwellings, 304 were razed by the civic body even as residents of 45 others were granted a stay when they approached court against the eviction drive. The developer had been paying Rs 2,000 to 304 households as rent after their dwellings were razed in August and September 2017. The developer was to begin work on the scheme after completion of the eviction drive and complete it within two years. The project, however, hit a roadblock after the district collectorate expressed its inability to give parts of government land for the project as it was reserved for other purposes. Of the 17,544 square metre land that was expected for the project, the VMC was left with only 11,477 square metre land. Of the four plots that were identified for the project, three were government plots while only one was of the civic body. The developer has now expressed inability to take up the project and has also stopped paying rent to the 304 beneficiaries since November 2018 as the land acquisition was making no headway. He has also sought a refund of Rs 65.31 lakh paid towards rent to the beneficiaries with an interest of 24 per cent. VMC is now looking to take up the project under the Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) mode under PMAY instead of the PPP mode. The VMC has estimated that it will be able to generate a revenue of Rs 26.28 crore by the sale of these houses and through contribution of government towards the houses. Against this it will spend around Rs 30.06 crore on the project. However, it will also be able to sell whatever it is allocated from the government land earlier earmarked for the project and generate more revenue.

A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

The civic body is eyeing to sell 46 plots in different areas of the city and has set a target of raising Rs 133 crore from the auction. For this, the civic body has made several changes in its procedures to ensure that the land parcels it owns and wants to put under the hammer find takers in the market this time, unlike its previous attempts. One of the major changes that it has proposed is of selling the land instead of giving it on a lease for 99 years. So far, the VMC only leased out its land which proved to be a major hurdle. It is also looking to sell land to government, semi-government and local self-government bodies without getting into the auction process. The VMC is also looking to give land at half prices for hospitals and schools. The changes have been made in line with a recent government resolution regarding auction of land. Another major change it has done is the need to approach the general board for getting the valuation of plots cleared and then approaching it again with the proceedings of the auction. This process has been done away with. The VMC has also re-evaluated five plots in the city as they had been valued in 2017. Attempts were made to auction these plots on 99 years\u2019 lease, but were unsuccessful. VMC is getting them re-evaluated as the valuation was old and market conditions and procedures have changed since. The civic body has also got valuation of 23 other plots in the city done through its valuation committee. A proposal regarding auction of another 18 plots is also pending with the general board of the VMC.

After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president. Nadda has long experience of the party organisation as he was the in-charge of the party headquarters and is a popular figure.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Vadodara medicos join protest against attacks on docs in WB": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/city-medicos-join-protest-against-attacks-on-docs-in-wb/articleshow/69795497.cms", "time": "2019-06-15 11:17:00", "description": "VADODARA: More than 1,000 members of Vadodara\u2019s medical fraternity joined the call for a nation-wide protest on Friday to express solidarity with doctors of West Bengal.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister said an active and effective opposition is a necessity in a democracy and pointed out that a well- argued and factual criticism of the government strengthens democracy. \"Sometimes such positive contributions are not noticed as they do not get high TRPs,\" he said. Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

But ask Jignesh Patel anything about tigers and he will dish out all the details as if he knows the animal like the back of his hand. It is not without a reason that Patel, a naturalist by profession, is the most sought after man in Tadoba Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra. Right from tourists to wildlife enthusiasts and visitors to Tadoba make it a point to meet Patel who recently published his book on tigers in Tadoba. \u201cThis is the first of its kind book where the tigers living in Tadoba have been profiled. The book contains details about the tiger reserve, rare photos of the tigers along with other animals,\u201d Patel, who has been working at a private lodge in Tadoba for last eight years, told TOI. \u201cI have profiled 50 different tigers in my profile that includes their description and age. Eight of them are legendary tigers,\u201d Patel, 35, said. \u201cWhenever a visitor came to Tadoba, he or she used to ask a lot of questions about the sanctuary, the tigers and other living beings here. Also, there used to be a lot of confusion about the identity of tigers. Over last few years, I had developed my own technique of identifying tigers. I can identify a tiger just by looking at its face and walk,\u201d Patel added. It was then that Patel\u2019s friends and colleagues suggested that he should share his knowledge with others and write a book. \u201cI began working on the book two years ago and it was recently released in Tadoba. Harsh Mahajan, a Barodian who took photos of tigers in Tadoba, also contributed to my book,\u201d Patel said. Interestingly, Patel is a fine arts graduate from M S University and hasn\u2019t taken any formal training in wildlife. \u201cI learnt everything about the tigers by reading books. It was my sheer passion that drove me to become a naturalist,\u201d he added.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

Pamphlets listing precautions people living near water-bodies should take were distributed in large numbers. The forest department had also made separate enclosures for washing clothes and toilets so that people don\u2019t venture near the rivers that are infested with crocodiles.

Before on-the-spot admission process could start at the building, the student leaders led by MSU Students Union general secretary Vraj Patel stood at the gate of the building, demanding that in-charge registrar should personally visit the building to see the lack of basic amenities even as university has decided to hike the fees. The student leaders first entered into heated arguments with members of the vigilance squad and demanded that in-charge registrar N K Ojha should pay a personal visit to the building to see the condition of classrooms, lack of drinking water facilities among others. When Ojha arrived at the building, he questioned the student leaders on timings of staging such a protest alleging that it was defaming the university. The student leaders however countered him stating that the authorities should provide proper amenities before deciding to hike the fees. The university had increased the fees of higher payment programme by Rs 2,230 from this academic year. On persistence of Ojha, student leaders made way for first timers and their parents who later entered the building for on-the-spot admission process. Later, Ojha visited the building along with commerce faculty\u2019s dean professor Dinkar Nayak and other officials. \u201cWe have been assured by the registrar that amenities at the unit building will be improved. We have withdrawn the protest for now but if things don\u2019t improve, we will continue our protest,\u201d said Patel.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

The money raised will be used in particular for projects taken up under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). The cash-strapped VMC has been finding it difficult to manage funds required for different projects. It finds itself in hand-to-mouth situation whenever the octroi grant given by the state government gets delayed. Contractors too have held protests and made representations in the past regarding delays in payment of works done by them. The VMC has taken up development works amounting to Rs 519.83crore under AMRUT. Of this, the civic body will have to shell out Rs 217.76crore as its share while the remaining amount will be borne by the state and central governments. To finance this gap funding for AMRUT projects, the VMC is eyeing to raise Rs 100crore from municipal bonds. The civic body had made a proposal for the bonds in is annual budget and it was cleared by the general board. It has now started working on the details of the process of issuing the bonds. It has already sent a letter to the state government seeking its nod to issue the bonds. In the meantime, the VMC is looking to appoint 10 different firms for taking up procedures related to the bond issue. The agencies include a transaction advisor and manager, an agency to look into the legal framework, two credit rating agencies, a trustee of bonds, an exchange to list the bonds, a registrar and transfer agent, a depository and demat account agency, a chartered accountancy firm and an honorary co-arranger. The administrative wing of the civic body has sought a nod from the standing committee to authorise the VMC commissioner to proceed with the procedures to appoint the agencies and then bring out the bonds. The committee did not decide on the bonds in its meeting held on Thursday and postponed the matter. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}}
