At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Garbage dumped nearby Chinese fishing net.": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/garbagedumpednearbychinesefishingnet-/articleshow/69616202.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Satta Matka 2018": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/agra-court-rejects-satta-king-shyam-vohra-bail-plea/articleshow/65506776.cms", "time": "", "description": "AGRA: Shyam Vohra, known as 'satta king' of the Taj city, was denied bail by district court of Agra.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar.

Whitetopping can be done in various ways \u2014 from ultra-thin to thin and thick. Among them, ultra-thin whitetopping (UWT), in which a concrete overlay of 50mm to 100mm thickness with closely spaced joints is bonded to an existing bituminous pavement, is the most widely used. It consists of a thin layer of fibre-reinforced concrete placed over a clean, chipped surface of bituminous concrete pavement, to achieve full or partial bonding. Though the corporation and the PWD had experimented with the technology earlier, it has not been widely adopted. In 2016, PWD had whitetopped a five-and-a-half kilometre stretch of road between HMT Junction and Manalimukku. \u201cIt was also one of the major recommendations of the Kochi Road Conclave organized by the Kochi corporation in 2011,\u201d said Sohan. The conclave had recommended whitetopping of all existing roads under the corporation, developing designer roads and the use of bitumen macadam and bitumen concrete (BMBC) in roads with high traffic density. \u201cWhitetopping has been done successfully in several states across India including Gujarat. It is high time that we adopted it. It acts like waterproofing and can reduce damage due to seeping in of water during the rains,\u201d said Sohan. Whitetopping can uniformly fill pores in bituminous pavements more effectively and thus help reduce the occurrence of cracks. \u201cIt is also cost-effective,\u201d he said. Apart from IRC, Cement Manufacturers Association has also recommended it. The technology offers long life, low maintenance and low life-cycle cost apart from improved safety and environmental benefits.

The grenade exploded outside the headquarters. No casualties have been reported. The first attack happened on Monday morning when a team of security men was on a cordon-and-search operation in Achabal. Terrorists fired at the team, who then retaliated.

The results in the state reflect the protest of the faithful against the LDF government for failing to protect their faith and also against the Central government, which failed to resolve the issue. The result was the reaction of believers, irrespective of caste and religion, for insulting Lord Ayyappa. The Constitution assures freedom for religious faith and related activities.

Inaction by the voter in getting his name restored also won\u2019t justify such action, the court said. The judgment by Justice Shaji P Chaly came after considering a petition filed by 64-year-old A Subair of Chala in Thiruvananthapuram, questioning the removal of his name from the voters\u2019 list prepared for the Lok Sabha elections this year. Names of his wife and daughter were retained while his was removed on the report of booth level officer that he changed his residence. Referring to Section 22 of the Representation of the People Act of 1950, the court pointed out that the statute says the voter should be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard. The judgment said, \u201cOn an evaluation of the said provisions, it is explicit that, they are peremptory in nature and can never be brushed aside or overlooked. Proviso thereto makes it clear that before removing a person from the voters list, the electoral registration officer is duty bound to give the person concerned a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of the action proposed to be taken. Which thus also means, the action or enquiry contemplated under Sec 22 of the Act, 1950 is not an empty formality, but on the other hand, founded on principles of natural justice, which if violated, action becomes arbitrary and illegal inviting action against the officer concerned.\u201d No opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner in the case, the court added. The Election Commission had contended that the removal from voters\u2019 list was preceded by several steps such as inviting objections to draft electoral roll, including giving publicity to \u2018deleted lists\u2019 and that a final electoral roll was published at the end of a process that lasted over a year. After finding that no opportunity of hearing was granted to the petitioner, the court said, \u201cIt is also apposite to mention that, mere inaction on the part of the petitioner to restore the name removed from the voters list, is not a justification for removing the name, otherwise than in accordance with law.\u201d The court then ordered the chief election commissioner of Kerala to conduct a detailed inquiry into the incident and, if required, take appropriate action against the officers who removed the petitioner\u2019s name from the voters list within two weeks.

Studies by the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology have shown that energy efficient fishing systems including changes in the vessels, engine horsepower, gear and operations could reduce the carbon emissions. Fisheries scientists who have been working on sustainable fishing technology said that vessel design, construction and operation fishing gear and methods, adoption of advanced technology and fleet management conservation, management and enhancement of resources were the key. \u201cAcross the world studies have calculated the carbon footprint of major fish harvesting systems like trawling, purse seining, gillnetting and long lining. For example, in trawling, the global warming potential is 5.43 per kilo of fish caught,\u201d said Leela Edwin, head, department of fishing technology, CIFT. According to a series of studies by the CIFT scientists including Leela Edwin, Dhiju Das and Renju Ravi under a project on green fishing systems for tropical seas, fisheries in India consume as much as 1378.8 million litres of fuel and releases 3.13 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. The energy use in fishing begins from going to and from the fishing ground, dropping the nets, the fishing method, processing and transporting to consumer and this was calculated under the life cycle assessment of the individual fishing units. \u201cCIFT has worked with the Kerala government to fix optimum limits for boat engines and fishing gears. This along with other standards for the materials will ensure that we will be able to reduce the energy consumption in the fisheries sector. This will help in the usage of sustainable gear for the fishing sector and this is now being implemented in this sector,\u201d Leela Edwin said. Fishing vessel hull optimization, reduction of engine rpm, periodic maintenance of hull and replacement of two-stroke petrol engine to the inboard diesel engine is recommended to reduce the environmental impact related to the fishing operation. Use of high durable alternative webbing materials and appropriate use of lead sinkers will increase the life of gear and reduce environmental impacts.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Inaction by the voter in getting his name restored also won\u2019t justify such action, the court said. The judgment by justice Shaji P Chaly was after considering a petition (WP-C No. 13684/2019) filed by 64-year-old A Subair of Chala in Thiruvananthapuram questioning removal of his name from the voters list prepared for the Lok Sabha Elections this year. Names of his wife and daughter were retained while his was removed on the report of booth level officer that he changed his residence. Referring to section 22 of Representation of the People Act of 1950, the court pointed out that the statute says the voter should be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard. The judgment said, \u201cOn an evaluation of the said provisions, it is explicit that, they are peremptory in nature and can never be brushed aside or overlooked. Proviso thereto makes it clear that before removing a person from the voters list, the electoral registration officer is duty bound to give the person concerned a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of the action proposed to be taken. Which thus also means, the action or enquiry contemplated under Sec.22 of the Act, 1950 is not an empty formality, but on the other hand, founded on principles of natural justice, which if violated, action becomes arbitrary and illegal inviting action against the officer concerned.\u201d No opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner in the case, the court added. The Election Commission had contended that the removal from voters list was preceded by several steps such as inviting objections to draft electoral roll, including giving publicity to \u2018Deleted Lists\u2019 and that a final electoral roll was published at the end of a process that lasted over a year. After finding that no opportunity of hearing was granted to the petitioner, the court said, \u201cIt is also apposite to mention that, mere inaction on the part of the petitioner to restore the name removed from the voters list, is not a justification for removing the name, otherwise than in accordance with law.\u201d The court then ordered the chief election commissioner of Kerala to conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident and, if required, take appropriate action against the officers who removed the petitioner\u2019s name from the voters list within two weeks.

But while many went around romancing the first monsoon showers of the year and clicking selfies, some felt unwelcoming about the rains, and in fact were reduced to anxiety. Research student Sooraj H from Kochi was one such. He had been trapped in Kochi during the unprecedented floods of August and now he can barely look out of the window without feeling restless and breaking into palpitations. For the past two months, he has also been experiencing severe mood swings and sleeplessness and it had begun to affect his work and relationship. Sooraj, who now stays alone in the city, sought help from his friends and explained how his anxiety is affecting his life. \u201cI tried my best to stay calm, but I lost my control when the Orange Alert and low pressure at sea were announced. Also, the video that has been doing the rounds of the flooding at Fort Kochi beach, where I used to hang out, added to my stress,\u201d he says. He approached a psychologist. \u201cI feel much better now as I have understood what is happening to me.\u201d In 2018, Kerala saw its worst monsoon since 1924, as the state\u2019s 44 rivers ran wild, and left over 3.1 lakh homeless; 1,568 relief camps were opened, 432 people died, and several went missing. The Kerala government reported that one-sixth of the state\u2019s population were directly affected by the unexpected natural disaster, causing them mental and physical trauma. As the disaster-affected people in Kerala are trying hard to rebuild their lives, experts say that many are being silently eaten up by the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress reaction and acute mental exertion, called anniversary reaction, that could hit one around the time the natural disaster or trauma last struck. According to Dr Vivek Ullattil, a psychiatrist from Ernakulam, over the past two months, most of his cases are related to anxiety stemming from the floods. He points out, \u201cWith the start of the monsoon, their anxieties, which were suppressed for a year, are coming out. They are anxious about whether the dams be opened again and if there will be human loss.\u201d His cases, he says, can be categorised into those of people directly affected by the floods, those who have an anxious personality and always consider the worst-case scenario and thirdly, people who have a family history of anxiety disorder or depression. \u201cThe monsoon triggers their stress,\u201d he says. Dr Jaico Paulose, who was actively involved in the flood relief activities at Thiruvalla, explains that panic attacks and PTSD affect not just adults, but also children. \u201cThe shock is imprinted in children who tend to replay the moments when they had to leave their homes in a hurry due to the waterlogging. It is also very important to address the concerns of children who were trapped inside the house while the water level was rising, as they will be more stressed out.\u201d Pointing to some cases that came to his hospital at Thiruvalla, Jaico says it is essential for the public to have proper awareness on the mental health issues that one can have after being exposed to extreme life events. \u201cIn the event of a panic attack, one experiences intense anxiety and accompanied by a rapid heartbeat. So, they quickly head to the cardiologist. Most of the chest discomfort cases we see at our casualty are in fact, just those who suffer panic attacks, which can cause them to feel that they will die right the next moment,\u201d he explains. The levels of stress can be classified into mild, moderate and severe. Mild and moderate stress can be treated through non-pharmacological treatments. Vivek says, \u201cIf it is in mild form, one should try to divert their attention by listening to music or taking up an activity or hobby. But if you feel it is going to be difficult to control, you should seek help. Most of the time, minor attacks can be handled by a strong social support system. People who live alone and have no support base will be more prone to panic attacks, so create a strong support system. Everybody becomes anxious and panics in such a situation but when it is excessive and if you feel it is affecting how you live and function, you need to take help.\u201d If it is severe and is affecting their sleep, appetite, relationship and work, they must take counselling or medication. \u201cMany people who come to us feeling mentally disabled, then go on to lead successful lives after identifying their condition as a panic attack. Once they identify this, we teach them to live through the panic attack by prescribing them some relaxation exercises and so on,\u201d says Jaico. But doctors warn against ignoring the symptoms as it may cause major problems. Jaico adds, \u201cThose who have not taken help will avoid going out and prefer to stay inside, as they could be suffering from anticipatory anxiety. They will also confine to their safe zone which is called acrophobic disorder. Once it is cured, they will be free mentally and will be able to face life better.\u201d For children the trauma lingers. Their stress level depends on the reaction of the adults at home. \u201cSo, the cure can be done together,\u201d he says. Who is vulnerable to PTSD?1.

Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

As the day progressed, most of them, to whom the acting class was a novelty, were fully engrossed in Beto\u2019s engaging conversations and \u2018games\u2019. The tips and tricks he shared in the class, according to the participants, were not just lessons in acting, but for life.  \u201cI was super-excited to attend the training ever since I read about him. It was truly worth it. I loved the way he communicated ideas and how he explained to us the importance of knowing one\u2019s own body. Being a college lecturer, it is really important to know how to build a connect with my students and how to transform myself by transforming others,\u201d says Lesly Augustine, assistant professor, Sacred Hearts College, Kochi.  Beto Ruiz Beto, who heads the acting department at the Intercultural Theatre Institute (ITI) in Singapore, has found his third home at Kerala. He, together with a few artistes and art enthusiasts, including koodiyattom performer Kapila Venu, has started a collective in Kerala named Across the River to create international productions. The collective aims at bringing together actors from across the world, including from ITI. \u201cWe are creating and devising a new project which is inspired by the works of Arundhati Roy\u2019s God of Small Things and Perumal Murugan\u2019s One Part Woman respectively. We are rehearsing at Irinjalakuda,\u201d says Beto, adding that as an outsider he can view India through new eyes, though he has learnt koodiyattom, kalaripayattu and other art forms of Kerala. \u201cI am focusing more on inter-culturalism with an exchange of ideas, cultures and views with others and seeking people\u2019s responses to the current times. The two books surprised me as I was able to resonate with Mexican social issues while reading it. So, I understood, there is a connection between the two countries; we are not similar, yet we are not totally different.\u201d Talking about the recent workshop, Beto says that he was excited to see that there are so many people at the workshop interested in performing and who aspire to be artistes. \u201cThe exchange I have with experienced actors who attend my workshop is fulfilling. The more I do, the more questions I have, be it from books or the conversations. They make the dialogues fresh and make my life productive and healthy. When freshers walk in, I see less ego, less vanity and more energy. An artiste is at first a human and then an artiste, so it will be always good for anybody to be part of acting classes. I see people who get so inspired for life from the games we play. My aim is to create honest performers,\u201d he says. An expert in Kundalini Yoga, Beto picked theatre as a career when he was 15. After completing an undergraduate course in theatre at Guadalajara, Mexico, Beto went to Singapore as he felt there was a need to preserve the holistic approach traditional theatre brings in, where dancers, singers, musicians and actors work together. So, he studied Asian theatre forms and did a theatre training and research programme in Singapore. His prominent works as a director include operas, such as Verdi\u2019s La Traviata and Purcell\u2019s Dido and Aeneas, and plays such as Dario Fo\u2019s Un Dia Cualquiera and Alfred Jarry\u2019s King Ubu. He has also worked on productions in the US, Colombia and Poland. \u201cI was completely trained in realism, as three decades ago, that was the only practice in Mexico. I felt attracted with the mysteries of our body, so I was also trained in contemporary dancing. Then I began doing physical theatre and dance theatre and started exploring its possibilities. At ITI, I found Michel Chekov\u2019s style interesting and that is what I am now working on. I am also following the idea of interdisciplinary practice, using the body in all its possibilities,\u201d he says, adding that the Across the River collective\u2019s project will feature all these ideas.

Following this, around 728kg of sandalwood pieces, from the biggest sandal seizures reported in Andhra Pradesh, had to be handed over to the AP forest officials for safe custody and the Kerala team had to return empty-handed. The officers include Munnar divisional forest officer (DFO) Narendrababu, Marayoor DFO B Ranjit and Marayoor range officer Job J Neriamparampil. According to sources, the team reached Andhra Pradesh on Sunday evening along with Shuhaib alias Kunajappa (36) of Pookkotur in Malappuram, the kingpin of the inter-state smuggling gang, who was arrested on Wednesday night. The operation was part of collecting evidences, based on the information extracted from Shuhaib who had reportedly smuggled more than 20,000kg of sandalwood from Kerala to Andhra Pradesh, of which nearly 10,000kg was sold to the said factory. An officer in the team said they had taken all requisite permission from the state government and given prior intimation to the Andhra forest department while maintaining the confidential nature of the operation. The team, after cordoning off the factory area on Sunday night, started the raid around 5am which continued to till 1pm on Monday. \u201cAfter the raid, while we were loading the sandalwood pieces on to a truck, AP forest officials arrived in a jeep and told us that we cannot take the items with us until we followed proper legal procedures. After nearly an hour of argument, they took us to the Chittoor East forest division office to talk with the DFO,\u201d he said. The officials were later allowed to return after the Kerala and Andhra forest ministers intervened. The seized sandalwood will be in the Chittoor DFO\u2019s custody until the Kerala team gets legal clearance. The team is currently on its way back to Kerala with the accused. Meanwhile, Ajay Kumar, PRO to the forest minister, said that the entire operation was conducted with full support of AP forest department and there were no issues between officials of two states.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

Justice PV Asha issued a stay for two months after considering during admission hearing a petition (WP-C No. 15937/2019) filed by higher secondary school teacher Saju Mathew of Kadanad in Kottayam and two others. In addition to this petition, Nair Service Society (NSS) and Aided Higher Secondary School Teachers Association have also approached the court. It was alleged in the petition that implementation of the report of the three-member committee headed by MA Khader to unify the three directorates \u2013 directorate of public instruction, higher secondary directorate, and vocational higher secondary directorate \u2013 goes against the provisions of Kerala Education Rules (KER). The government has issued an order whereby the principal of higher secondary wing has been entrusted with the charge of high school wing. The two wings are separate units and it is not intended in the statute, the petition said. It is pointed out by the petitioners that a higher secondary school teacher (HSST) requires a post graduation whereas a headmaster of a school need not have post graduation. On re-designating the headmaster as principal, he would be intermediate of HSST and principal. Thus, a lesser-qualified person is placed above the HSST, which is against fairness. When a headmaster is re-designated as vice principal, it would create a stalemate in granting promotion to HSST as principal over and above the vice principal. Such a system would create havoc in the realm of school administration, the petition said. In its petition, NSS has alleged that the government\u2019s move goes against Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE), in addition to Kerala Education Act and KER. The three-member committee went beyond its terms of reference and its recommendation for a monolithic administrative structure goes against RTE\u2019s idea of stand-alone primary and upper primary section with separate administrative setup, NSS has argued. The committee\u2019s recommendation also goes against the principle of decentralization and has proceeded without conducting any empirical study, NSS\u2019 plea had stated. Meanwhile, state government has filed an affidavit stating that it implemented the policy decisions after wide consultations with all stakeholders in the best interest of the public and the student community in general. A principal would hold the charge of all academic and administrative matters of higher secondary section whereas a vice principal will hold the charge of high school section, government said in the affidavit. Its decision to implement the unification in stages is intended to provide a uniform governance structure in all administrative and other matters in a campus having higher secondary school, high school, and vocational higher secondary school, government said, adding that there would be no change in service conditions, monetary benefits, or opportunities of employees.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

With the success of the first solar passenger boat, the water transport department is all set to launch three more boats in the coming months. \u201cAditya, our first solar boat has been running successfully for the last two years and not a trip has been cancelled. The fuel costs have just been Rs 200-280 for electricity and we have saved about Rs 48 lakhs on diesel,\u201d said SWTD director Shaji Nair. Three of the boats including a cruise-liner will become operational in the next few months. The tendering process for the construction of another three boats will begin by the end of this year. Nair said that in contrast to the huge criticism and pressure that the department faced for venturing into solar-powered boats, Aditya is drawing international attention too. \u201cWe had senior officials from almost 40 countries visiting us recently to travel in the boat. They were part of the International solar alliance (ISA) and had come to look at the boat so that it could be replicated and customized in their countries,\u201d he said. Of the two new boats under construction at NavAlt, one will be a return boat in the Vaikkom- Thavanakadavu route while the other would be in the Panavally-Thiruvananthapuram route.

The first solar boat, Aditya, has completed two years of service in January. During the period, the boat carried 6, 00,000 passengers and travelled around 38,000 km without a single drop of fuel thereby saving 58,000 litres of diesel. This saved Rs 45 lakhs in diesel and maintenance cost during the period. Sandith Thandasherry, the man behind India\u2019s first solar-powered ferry and CEO of NavAlt Solar and Electric Boats said that all countries in the tropical area were interested in the solar boats and the delegation which visited Aditya was in discussions with his company for manufacturing solar boats.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

There are more than 20 major bridges built across waterbodies in and around Kochi city bearing the entire load of traffic. Kochi, one of the cities with highest traffic density in the state, saw a growth of registered vehicles from 22,163 in 2009 to 31,111 in 2018. Apart from these vehicles registered in Ernakulam, vehicles from other districts as well as states pass through the commercial capital of Kerala every day. However, these bridges saw little maintenance over the years. S Shaheem, director incharge of National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (Natpac), said regular maintenance of bridges is mandatory to meet the pressure of increasing vehicular movement. \u201cThe public works department (PWD) is bound to ensure that contractors undertake periodical maintenance work without fail,\u201d he said. Shaheem said the department has the responsibility to include necessary clauses in the contract which facilitates maintenance works by a contractor for a specified period of time. V K Jayadevan, a former official in Kerala Engineering Research Institute, said bearings and road toppings need frequent upkeep. \u201cThe concrete mix used for road works should be tested during the construction to ensure that the bridge or the road meet its strength as per the design,\u201d he said. Officials with PWD said bridges are designed after taking into consideration \u201canticipated vehicle movement\u201d. An official with PWD quality control wing said bridges should stand at least for a minimum of 100 years. \u201cBridges have to be built as per the standards stated in Indian Road Congress (IRC). The bridges are to be designed only after assessing the intensity of vehiclular movement through the road where it is being planned to come up,\u201d she said. Officials in the design wing of PWD said bearings in bridges that see high vehicular movement will have to be replaced within 30 years. \u201cEarlier bridges were constructed under 70 R Loading. When heavy vehicles pass through these bridges, it jerks. In such cases, we install warning boards near the bridge. Now, we construct bridges following the guidelines of IRC,\u201d an official said. A former Natpac official said the contractor should construct the bridge linking the number of vehicles plying on it and the load the bridge has to bear. \u201cThe width of the bridge is decided based on the number of vehicles that will have to ply on it once the construction is completed. The super structure is constructed after studying the load the bridge has to carry. Wind force in the area should also be considered to ensure the strength of the bridge,\u201d said T Elangovan, former director of Natpac. PWD minister K Sudhakaran said the state government has conducted audit of bridges across the state. \u201cAfter the bridge at Enath in Pathanamthitta developed cracks, we conducted a study to assess the condition of bridges in the state. On the basis of the study, we categorised around 3,000 bridges into three: ones that need to be pulled down and reconstructed, to be repaired, and those are in good condition,\u201d Sudhakaran said. \u201cWe are reconstructing or repairing the bridges on a priority basis,\u201d he said.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony.

Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

It was alleged by the petitioners that the government's move would give the charge of principal of higher secondary school to headmaster of high school. As headmasters need not have post graduation and higher secondary school teachers need post graduation, it would result in placing a head master over higher secondary school teachers. Nair Service Society (NSS), which runs many schools in the state, had also questioned implementation of the commission report before the high court.

Nadda's appointment as working president was on the cards after he was not inducted into the government. Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Congratulations to him on becoming the working president of the party,\" the Prime Minister added. Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president. Nadda has long experience of the party organisation as he was the in-charge of the party headquarters and is a popular figure.

A petition filed by CBI seeking transfer of trial and further proceedings to the special court here was considered by the high court. Transferring of the case pending before Thalassery sessions court is needed so that the additional report filed in the case can also be considered by the trial court, CBI had argued. CBI approached the high court after the Thalassery court declined to accept its report and asked it to approach the special court in Ernakulam. The high court had earlier stayed further proceedings in the case at Thalassery sessions court. It was on February 20, 2012 that Shukkoor was murdered in broad daylight after holding him hostage at Ariyil near Pattuvam in Kannur. This was allegedly in retaliation of workers of Muslim League\u2019s youth wing blocking vehicles of CPM leaders. In the chargesheet filed in February this year, CBI had named CPM leaders P Jayarajan and TV Rajesh to be involved in the conspiracy. A single bench of the high court had in February 2016 ordered CBI to conduct a further investigation in the case after considering a plea by the victim\u2019s mother. The court had pointed out that all those who were with the leaders were named as accused on conspiracy charge but they have been avoided. They were instead booked for a lighter offence, of not trying to prevent the murder after getting information about the conspiracy, the single bench had stated. Jayarajan and Rajesh had approached a division bench challenging the single bench\u2019s judgment but the order for further investigation was confirmed in February 2017.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister said an active and effective opposition is a necessity in a democracy and pointed out that a well- argued and factual criticism of the government strengthens democracy. \"Sometimes such positive contributions are not noticed as they do not get high TRPs,\" he said. Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said. Referring to his recent speeches, the Prime Minister said that \"we started with ' sab ka saath, sab ka vikas', but the people have added an unprecedented 'vishwas' (trust) to the matter\".

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Sreedharan, along with a team of experts from Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) Kanpur and Madras, visited the flyover around 8am and inspected the restoration works. The flyover has been closed for traffic for more than a month. Though Sreedharan spent around one and a half hours at the flyover inspecting the pillars, girders and the cracks, he refused to openly speak about the defects. According to DMRC sources, he is expected to submit an inspection report directly to the state government in the coming days based on which the state government will take a call on whether the flyover should be restored or demolished. Sreedharan was roped in for the inspection by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan after a meeting with PWD minister G Sudharkaran last week. Sreedharan, who started the inspection from the northern end of the flyover, walked beneath the 750m flyover and conducted a detailed inspection of each pillar and girder. Alaga Sundara Murthy, professor of structural engineering laboratory at the department of civil engineering at IIT-Madras, and Mahesh Tandon from IIT-Kanpur accompanied him through the inspection. Officials from PWD, roads and bridges development corporation of Kerala limited (RBDCK) and Kitco Ltd were also present.

He showed him the cracks on the pillars and girders which have been posing threat to the bridge\u2019s stability. The reinforcement and restoration works of the flyover were also monitored by the team. The team reportedly raised concerns about the severe cracks on the girders. After the inspection beneath the bridge, the team went to the top of the bridge where they spent around 15 minutes to inspect the potholes and cracks.

The busy stretch of road, which experiences heavy traffic during peak hours, has turned into a death trap for two-wheeler riders. The latest victim was Santhosh, a postmaster. Santhosh fell in front of a speeding truck as his two-wheeler lost control after the front wheel hit a stone detached from a nearby pothole. He was run over by the truck and died on the spot. Though the Pettah-Gandhi Square Road is part of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi highway, its condition is pathetic and not properly maintained, said Vishwanathan, a resident near Gandhi-Square. Two weeks ago, a housewife riding her two-wheeler was caught under the wheels of a speeding tipper, while trying to avert a large pothole, in front of NSS Karayogam Hall. \u201cCiting the dilapidated state of this stretch from Pettah to Gandhi Square, we have submitted a memorandum to national highway authorities in December,\u201d said V P Chandran, councillor of the area. However, till date no action had been taken to make the road fit for smooth traffic, he added. Even pedestrians have lost their lives because of the poor condition of the road, said Sivasankaran, a resident of Maradu. Last year, Ravi Menon, a scooter mechanic, was crushed under the wheels of a speeding car, which had lost control while trying to avert a gutter near Tripunithura mini bypass, he said. However, senior officials of National Highways Authority of India insisted that the initial repair works of the stretch between Pettah and Gandhi Square was on and would soon be implemented.

In 2017, agricultural minister V S Sunilkumar has announced a winter vegetable zone in Vattavada and Kanthalloor, including Devikulam block, to make the region as the winter vegetable hub of the state. Sunilkumar had inaugurated over Rs 11 crore worth winter vegetable and fruit production development project in Kanthalloor and Vattavada and promised that the government will boost winter vegetable and fruit production in the area and will develop the centre as the state\u2019s best vegetable production centre. But after the three years, the project has stopped without any benefit to the farmers in the region. A department official said the government might announce another project that is why it is stopping the zone. Vattavada winter vegetable farmers\u2019 society president K Jayaprakash said, \u201cThe farmers in the Kanthalloor and Vattavada regions expected that the winter vegetable zone project will be completed soon. The farmers in the region have not been getting any benefit from the winter vegetable zone project for the last three years.\u201d \u201cThe Vattavada and Kanthalloor regions have a huge potential to produce winter vegetables and fruits. The subsidy announced for winter vegetable farmers in the region has not been distributed yet,\u201d Jayaprakash said. Prince Mathew, Idukki agricultural deputy director (Horticulture mission), said: \u201cThe three year project has completed its tenure, and winter vegetable production has increased in the area. The subsidy money of the farmers will be distributed soon.\u201d Vattavada and Kanthalloor regions are known as the hub of cool season vegetables. An estimate of 2,725 hectares of winter vegetables were cultivated in the region. Potato, beans, cabbage, carrot and garlic are the main cool season vegetables in Kanthalloor and Vattavada, natives said. \u201cThe agricultural minister will visit Vattavada and Kanthalloor .We expect the minister will announce a big project in Kanthalloor and Vattavada to encourage the winter vegetable production,\u201d an agricultural department official said.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?
