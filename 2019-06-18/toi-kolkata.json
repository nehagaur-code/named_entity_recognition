At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "\nFolk Music at City Cafeteria in Kolkata\n": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Folk-Music-at-City-Cafeteria-in-Kolkata/articleshow/46984490.cms", "time": "", "description": "Music lovers of the city enjoyed a good dose of folk music at a city cafeteria.

It also took coaxing by many senior doctors to bring the agitators to the table. Since Monday morning, the junior doctors had gone into a huddle. Heated arguments ensued, quelled by some sane voices, as they discussed whether they should go to Nabanna or not and the conditions they wanted to lay down. Even till the last moment, uncertainly loomed large as the junior doctors\u2019 demand for live coverage was initially not being met with. \u201cWe wanted the meeting to be recorded on camera so that the government does not go back on its assurances. We were sceptical as many previous promises have not been implemented. Once this condition was agreed upon, we knew we could attend the meeting,\u201d said a junior doctor from NRS. The agitators said they had started to discuss to end the agitation on Friday itself, when they joined emergency services. But the CM\u2019s visit to SSKM Hospital and her reported outburst against the protesters apparently ended all hope for a rapprochement. \u201cThe cease-work was to put pressure on the state administration so that we get a congenial environment at work. Since it had turned into a mass movement, retracting from it was difficult,\u201d said another junior doctor at NRS. \u201cBut we knew that patients were suffering and so, the public might turn against us any time.\u201d The agitators followed closely as five senior doctors visited Nabanna on Friday but when a toned-down CM appealed to them on Saturday to have a talk, they realised they should not miss this opportunity. \u201cSenior doctors, who had continuously been talking to us, said if we did not call an end to the impasse, the public might turn their ire on these very justified demands. We started deliberating on it,\u201d said a junior doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. The hope for a solution glimmered as junior doctors on Sunday night agreed to speak to the CM at Nabanna. But again, they demanded a live coverage. \u201cIt had become a sort of ego issue for both the sides. But once the CM invited us for the talks, we took a step forward. Many faculty members also told us it should be now or never,\u201d said an agitating doctor. Seven senior doctors from Joint Platform of Doctors had been camping at NRS since morning. Even as DME Pradip Mitra tried to convey there was no need for live coverage, the junior doctors put their foot down. Seven senior doctors finally convinced the DME for the live coverage. So even while the negotiation on the media coverage continued, the agitators started enlisting their representatives for the Nabanna meet. Once the written communication reached them around 2.45pm, they decided to head for Nabanna.

Police were informed and a team of divers from the disaster management group joined the rescue operation,\" said DC (Port) Syed Waquar Raza.

The final dip made by Chanchal Lahiri\"He performed almost an hour earlier. Hence, river traffic police was absent,\" said a Port division officer. Police said Lahiri drowned around 12.30pm and it is unclear whether he was performing or practising the act. Moments before the stunt on Sunday, Lahiri said, \"If you perform a dangerous trick perfectly, you are a magician. If you fail, it is always tragic.\" Mandrake's body was fished out on Monday\"Bound and chained, Mandrake was lowered 30 feet under water. Thousands watched and it is impossible the cops missed the entire episode when even politicians were present,\" claimed a friend on Monday.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath. The Pro tem speaker ruled that the members stick to the format provided. After this, the members of BJP started adding 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' after end of every oath.

The arrests came as TMC youth wing president Abhishek Banerjee arrived here, met Monoranjan\u2019s family and said that CM Mamata Banerjee was monitoring the situation. The BJP supporters \u2014 Bibhas Malik, Shyamal Bag and Bhupati Kotal \u2014 were among 16 named in the FIR lodged at Khanakul police station on a complaint by Monoranjan\u2019s brother, Sandip. Hundreds of TMC workers and supporters gheraoed the police station on Sunday morning. They calmed down after the arrests. Monoranjan (56), a Khanakul panchayat samiti member, was attacked with rods and bamboo poles around 7.30pm on Saturday. He was secretary of Khanakul\u2019s Harish Chowk High School, where he taught part-time. His family told Abhishek he had been attacked three days ago but police did nothing to increase his security. Sandip was heard sobbing: \u201cThree persons who switched to BJP from CPM attacked him. My brother was taken to Khanakul hospital, but he had died by then.\u201d Abhishek later told the media: \u201cGoons whose name spelt terror during Left rule are back in action. Earlier, they enjoyed the shelter of CPM\u2019s Hooghly strongman Anil Basu. Now, they are spreading terror under the saffron party banner. Ram bhakts who claim to champion Hindutva interests are not hesitating to kill Hindus either. Please remain united and don\u2019t fear. I will return 10 days from now.

He has removed the secretary of La Martiniere Schools, Shane Calvert, and replaced him with the former secretary of the school, Supriyo Dhar. Letters to this effect reached both Calvert and Dhar at almost the same time before school started on Monday. The first change that Canning brought in was to reinstate T H Ireland as the principal of St James\u2019 School. He had been replaced by Hilda Peacock by an earlier order. In October 2018, Calvert had been ushered in by the then Bishop Probal Dutta, as part of a series of changes that his regime had rung in. One of the first steps taken then was bringing about changes in the board of governors of the La Martiniere Schools. Immediately thereafter, Dhar resigned from his position and Calvert was brought in as secretary. Dutta had said that since Calvert was also an educationist, he would help steer the school towards greater academic success. After resigning from his old position, Dhar took up an administrative post in Pailan World School. On Monday, however, he resigned to come back to La Martiniere. The letter that he received was signed by Bishop Canning and the priest of St Andrew\u2019s Church Swarup Bar \u2014 both ex-officio members of the board of governors of La Martiniere Scholls \u2014 and said he was to resume work as secretary of the schools from Monday itself. \u201cI am happy to be back. I am happy that the diocese thought that I was worthy enough to be called back as secretary of the two schools,\u201d Dhar said on Monday. The position of secretary of La Martiniere Schools is a full-time paid post. The letter that reached Calvert said he was being removed from the position of secretary with immediate effect and a month\u2019s salary would be paid. Calvert confirmed this. \u201cI have received a letter saying that my services are not needed any more,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThey did not give any reason as to why they have terminated me.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bishop-reinstates-ex-secy-of-la-martiniere-schools/articleshow/69833409.cms", "time": "2019-06-18 07:31:00"}, "Salman Proves": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/salman-khan-proves-age-is-just-a-number-lifts-up-his-bodyguards/videoshow/69836471.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Samsung Galaxy M40": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/samsung-galaxy-m40-to-go-on-its-first-sale-today-via-amazon/articleshow/69835432.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "\nParikrama makes JU groove to its beats in Kolkata\n": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Parikrama-makes-JU-groove-to-its-beats-in-Kolkata/articleshow/46704024.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Rajasthan Royals 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rajasthan-royals-team-2019-players-list-rr-team-2019/articleshow/67151472.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Let state governments function, TMC says after all-party meeting": {"description": "NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress on Sunday told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that state governments should be allowed to carry out their duties without any intervention from the Centre. The TMC, with 22 Lok Sabha MPs and 13 Rajya Sabha MPs \u2014 the third largest party in Parliament \u2014 reacted in the wake of the back-to-back advisories sent by the Union home ministry to Bengal. The MHA has also sought separate reports from the government on the ongoing doctors\u2019 strike and the political violence that has left 160 people dead in the last four years. \u201cIn a true federalism structure, stop interfering in states. The elected state governments must be allowed to run the states and institutions independently,\u201d TMC\u2019s parliamentary party leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O\u2019Brien, said after the all-party meeting convened by the PM in New Delhi on Sunday. Sudip Bandyopadhyay, TMC\u2019s parliamentary party leader in the Lok Sabha, was also present at the meeting. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on Saturday rubbished the claims of MHA about \u201cpoor\u201d law and order in the state, saying the Centre should send such advisories to states like Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat where \u201cseveral murders have been reported in the last couple of years\u201d. \u201cWe do not have any such situation in West Bengal. It is a very peaceful state. Ask the central government to send advisory to the Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat governments,\u201d she said. Banerjee added: \u201cIn the last three years, after the Yogi Adityanath government came to power in Uttar Pradesh, several people were killed in the name of encounters. They do not allow people to lodge FIRs in Gujarat. How many advisories have they sent to these states?\u201d About the junior doctors\u2019 agitation in Bengal, Banerjee said sometimes incidents of strike happen in a democracy. In Sunday\u2019s meeting, Samajwadi Party MP Ramgopal Yadav resonated Banerjee when he said the MHA sends an advisory to Bengal after three deaths and UP gets none after 25 deaths in post-poll violence. O\u2019Brien said that the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill should be passed in the first 10 days of the budget session of Parliament. This was agreed to by all parties. TMC has 41% women MPs in Parliament, the highest among all parties. He added that electoral reforms, including state funding of elections, should be discussed by all parties. \u201cAll of them should agree at the earliest, including paper ballots,\u201d he said. Talking about the scrutiny of bills, he said: \u201cWe have told the government that in the last five years, 25% of bills were scrutinised by the Parliamentary Committees before these were passed.\u201d \u201cAs much as 75% of bills were scrutinised in the first 60 years. In the 16th LS, only 25% underwent parliamentary scrutiny. So, we suggested that at least 75% should be scrutinised by the Standing Committee,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cBetween 1977 and 2005, out of 10 bills two were ordinances. But, in the last one year, there were four ordinances out of 10 bills. So, I request the government to not use the ordinance route.

Bose said a forensic team will visit the spot on Monday to find out the cause of the fire. He added that initially, there were two fire engines and later ladders were sent, following reports of people living in the building.

These measures are part of several long- and short-term measures being worked on by the Lalbazar brass. The state\u2019s repeated assurances to act tough against such offenders have, till now, failed to placate the protesters. The city cops are examining whether fresh penal charges can be slapped against repeat offenders involved in assault on doctors over the past two years. According to senior officers, Kolkata Police is examining all cases involving assault of doctors in the past two years in government and private hospitals. \u201cThe primary idea is to reach the trial stage quickly,\u201d said a senior officer. \u201cThe cops are also coordinating with the Directorate of Prosecutions (DoP) to expedite trial in cases where the chargesheet has already been filed.\u201d Sources said cases that are still under investigation will be monitored closely by the detective department for quick probes and follow-ups in a time-bound manner. The cops are also trying to find out and identify whether repeat offenders are involved in these cases. Sources said such people will be slapped with fresh penal cases. In the NRS case, the probe is likely to be completed in the 90-day time frame to enable in-custody trial of the accused. Five people have been arrested in this connection, all of whom have been bailed out by a city court. The cops have drawn up fresh charges and plan to record the statements of the injured doctors once they recover to explore whether harsher charges \u2014 including attempt to murder \u2014 can be drawn up. The case is likely to be handed over to the detective department once the preliminary probe is completed by the Entally police, said a senior officer. Police commissioner Anuj Sharma, who visited the NRS hospital on Tuesday immediately after the attack on the doctors and vandalism on Monday night, has held several discussions with senior officers and the health department to work on these legal and administrative measures.

This softening of stance had initially come with a rider: the meeting cannot be held behind closed doors, and the media should be allowed to telecast it live, though this demand is likely to be dropped. The state government res-ponded immediately, proposing a 3pm meeting at Nabanna on Monday, but cited legalities and constitutional propriety, which prevents such meetings from being held under full public glare. This request is likely to be granted by the doctors, sources indicated on Sunday, paving the way for \u201cacross-the-table\u201d discussions between the protesters and the chief minister. \u201cWe are very hopeful about the meeting in Nabanna on Monday,\u201d a senior officer, mediating for the state, said. \u201cWe have explained to them that given the issues involved, mainly legal, administrative and security-related, it is impossible for the state government to agree to their demand for an open-door meeting in presence of media. The chief minister is also sworn to an oath of secrecy in some such matters. We have explained they have every right to speak to the media aft-erwards, much like the norm in all such cases. They have agreed to it,\u201d he said, requesting anonymity. The junior doctors, however, insist on video-recording the entire deliberations. The doctors, however, issued no statement on either this or their intent to attend the Nabanna meeting. Under pressure from several quarters, including sen-iors in the medical fraternity, for being inflexible in their demands, the junior doctors \u2014 with representatives from various medical colleges \u2014 held a four-hour general body meeting at NRS Hospital\u2019s academic building. In a first, the director of medical education, Pradip Mitra, could speak in this GB meeting for several minutes. The meeting was also attended by some senior members of the faculty. The meeting was initially split three ways: a section of doctors agreed to the meeting at Nabanna; another section stressed on a neutral venue, such as Raj Bhavan; the other \u2014 a smaller section \u2014 insisted on holding the meeting at NRS. Meanwhile, pressure mounted on the doctors to find an end to the impasse. At 3.30pm, a group of doctors came out to announce their stand. They put in a few conditions \u201cfor the sake of transparency\u201d, pointing to a lack of trust between the doctors and the administration. Continuing to address the CM as \u201cmanoniya (respected)\u201d, as they did on Saturday night, while they spoke in Bengali, the striking doctors claimed that \u201cdiscrepancies\u201d in the CM\u2019s last statement had created confusion among people regarding their \u201cmotto behind protest\u201d. \u201cWe are hopeful that our CM will be considerate enough to solve the problems that the state is facing in the healthcare sector,\u201d they said in a statement, refusing to accept any question from the media. \u201cWe leave the decision to choose the venue to the honourable chief minister, but it should accommodate representatives of all medical colleges of West Bengal in sufficient numbers,\u201d the statement read. They expressed willingness to join work \u201cas early as possible in the best interest of the common people once our demands are logically addressed and met adequately through discussions\u201d. The press release issued at 4.20pm, however, dropped their \u201cpresence of national media\u201d demand. Immediately after the student presser, DME Mitra apprised state health secretary Rajiva Sinha and the state administration, including the CM. Based on their go-ahead, he further met protesting students at the venue and stressed on the need for a closed-door meeting. Mitra also communicated that the number of delegates should be either one or two representatives from each of the 14 medical colleges in Bengal. With the students agreeing finally, a 3pm schedule was finalised after consulting the CM.

In most hospitals, less than 25% of the doctors were present while a couple of establishments shut their OPDs for the day as none of the doctors reported for work. Even though in-patient and emergency services remained normal, scores of patients had to return disappointed from outdoors. The Medica Superspecialty Hospital OPD wore a deserted look on Monday morning. Instead of the buzz that is generated by around 1,000 patients on a normal day, the OPD looked almost empty and silent with fewer than 50 patients being around. None of the doctors at the hospital attended to patients. Less than 40% of doctors were present at the Belle Vue Clinic OPD. A mere 42 patients registered, instead of the 350-odd on a normal day. \u201cSome of our doctors attended chambers but very few patients were present. Normal functioning was affected,\u201d said CEO P Tondon. While Peerless Hospital kept its OPD shut, Ruby General Hospital received around 150 OPD patients on Monday. It was far fewer than the normal number, which is usually around 350. \u201cLess than a fourth of our doctors reported to duty and some of them did attend to patients. Most of our doctors had taken leave from their OPD duties on Monday and had duly informed us about their decisions. So we knew that our OPD would collapse,\u201d said general manager operations of Ruby Subhashish Dutta. Majority of the doctors at CMRI Hospital stayed away from OPD, while patient attendance dropped to less than 10% of the normal figure. A mere 150 patients sought treatment across the three units of AMRI Hospitals on Monday. On a normal day, the hospital receives more than 850 OPD patients at its Mukundapur, Dhakuria and Salt Lake facilities. \u201cDoctor attendance was very thin. Many of them called us to say they would not attend OPD. So we were ready for it. Very few patients turned up,\u201d said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Last Wednesday, too, OPD services had been affected after doctors chose to stay away in protest against the assault on junior medics at NRS Medical College and Hospital.

Chanchal Lahiri \u2014 who went under the stage name Mandrake \u2014 seems to have had little luck with this act. In 2013, when he performed the escape, he was assaulted by onlookers, who claimed they felt cheated as they had seen through the trick. There are conflicting reports on the accident, which happened around 12.35 pm near pillar 28 of Howrah bridge. A source said Lahiri had taken a launch to the broadest part of the river. Most spectators were on the vessel; others gathered on the shore and bridge. Lahiri was to tie his limbs and mouth and be dropped into the river by a crane. Some claimed he had jumped directly from the bridge, which authorities disputed. The plan was for him to swim back to the launch. Mandrake was no stranger to misadventures, recalls copBut the swim back never happened. \u201cWhen he did not come out for a long time, people panicked. A couple of people said they saw a man struggling, seeking help, in the middle of the river. The North Port police was informed and a team of divers from the disaster management group joined the rescue operation. Till late evening, Lahiri\u2019s body was yet to be recovered,\u201d said DC (Port) Syed Waquar Raza. \u201cLahiri is a resident of the southern suburbs of Kolkata. He had sought permission from both Kolkata Police and the Kolkata Port Trust. He had clearly mentioned the act was to happen on a boat or vessel and there was no connection with water. Hence, we allowed him permission. However, he did vaguely mention an \u2018extra act\u2019, which he did not clarify. We are investigating,\u201d Raza added. In 2013, facing assault from the mob, he had said he was merely trying to popularise the art of magic. \u201cMandrake had been put into a sixfoot-tall cage with six locks. It was to go 30 feet under water. Even as a crane lowered the cage into the river, thousands watched from the Howrah bridge and the launch jetty in Howrah. About six seconds later, Mandrake emerged from the water and climbed on to a launch. Soon after he reached the Howrah ferry ghat, he was surrounded by people who claimed they were cheated. The cage, they claimed, was fitted with a false door that was easily visible,\u201d one of the cops from the river traffic department recalled. But that wasn\u2019t Mandrake\u2019s first magic misadventure. Almost a decade earlier, he had declared that he would walk on the Hooghly waters, but had to beat a hasty retreat when the performance went wrong.

A Nigerian undertrial is an AIDS patient. She had complained of difficulty in vision and hearing as well as mild respiratory trouble. Officers from the Bidhannagar Commissionerate tried to convince doctors at the emergency ward to carry out some treatment but the doctors allegedly referred her to the out patients department that has been shut since Tuesday. Acting on intelligence inputs, NCB officers intercepted the 31-year-old woman the moment she landed in Kolkata from Mumbai. During a body search, LSD blots and cocaine were retrieved from her private parts. Initially, 20 LSD blots were found in her bag. But later, she took out 12gm cocaine from her private parts as well. After she complained of pain in her lower abdomen and revealed that more contraband substances were concealed inside her vagina, she was rushed to a nearby hospital, where a trans-vaginal USG test was carried out. It is during the routine tests that doctors found out that she was suffering from AIDS. The prison authorities also discharged five of nine convicts who were admitted to the hospital as they felt the prison doctor could provide some care till the imbroglio at government hospitals was resolved.

They have also pointed out that even though the measures promised by the government will not solve the healthcare problems in the short run but the meeting has managed to bring to the fore the constraints under which state hospital doctors have to function. \u201cWe are relieved that the deadlock has broken and the strike is about to be withdrawn. It was plaguing both the patients and doctors. While the meeting doesn\u2019t provide any long-term solution to the issues raised by the doctors, there is now an assurance that the short-term problems will be addressed. It has been a small but significant step on behalf of the government and if it continues to give doctors a patient hearing more serious issues like lack of resources, work pressure on doctors and the need for tighter security should be addressed sooner than later,\u201d said cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar. The ceasework by doctors was driving a wedge between them and the patients, that was turning out to be damaging for both, said oncologist Subir Ganguly. \u201cConflicts like this are bad for healthcare for they tend to pit patients and doctors. We must learn to co-exist and help each other. An amicable end to the crisis, however, promises to wipe out the bitterness. The agitation has exposed the trying circumstances under which doctors have to work and also the fact that they must keep serving with whatever they have for the sake of patients. I believe this fracas will actually bring patients and doctors together, though, in the long-run the government must look to enhance facilities and resources at state hospitals,\u201d said Ganguly. While the strained doctor-patient relationship has been prevented from worsening, the scars of the agitation will persist, felt IPGMER professor of surgery Diptendra K Sarkar. \u201cIt is important to ensure that the promises made at the meeting are kept. Doctors, on the other hand, should realize that they need to handle emergency cases better. But for a long-term improvement in doctor-patient relationship, we need better infrastructure at state hospitals and adequate security for doctors, otherwise a similar incident will be repeated soon,\u201d said Sarkar. Ganguly stressed on the need to sensitize patients, pointing out that doctors needed to communicate more frequently with patients\u2019 kin. \u201cA lot of issues can be solved if patient families and doctors interact more. It will lead to a higher degree of trust between them, which is sadly lacking now,\u201d he said.

An ode to the past: The collection, \u2018The Prince Unknown\u2019, took inspiration from the bygone era, but the balance of contemporary and traditional was well achieved in the designs that were all about structured silhouettes, drapes and layers. Says Shantanu, \u201cWe have always been inspired by the pre-Independence era. Through this collection, we revisited the palaces and had an insight into the lives of royalty. The princes and kings had a charming appeal and were known for their unique and classic style. They were fearless, indulgent and knew what luxury is. We wanted to show that prince and rulers in the past had a life which pretty much had the motto of work hard, party harder. So the fearless attitude is reflected in the structured silhouettes. There was also a bit of feminine touch through the drapes and layered effect. We used a lot of raw silk, jerseys to create that fall and effect in drapes and layers in kurtas.\u201d Of Nehru jackets and waistcoats: From rich tones like royal blue and maroon to subtle shades like beiges, brown and grey, the collection presented a mix of shades. Muted embroidery on jackets, texturing and fine detailing were noteworthy. Layered kurtas, bandhgalas, sherwanis with churidaars were part of the collection. The designers paid a lot of attention to jackets. \u201cThis time the emphasis is on our love for Nehru collars. Nehru collar was given different shapes, some rather high and some were kept in their natural form \u2013 something that we are used to seeing. Then there were variations in jacket lengths. There were cropped jackets, waist coats, bandhgalas and sherwanis with lengths kissing your knee and with high slits so that one can see the drama at the bottom. It was a jacket-focused collection and textures were very tone-on-tone. There was a hint of understated luxury throughout the collection,\u201d says Shantanu.

True to her word, Banerjee rushed to Institute of Neurosciences Kolkata (INK), where Paribaha is being treated, later in the evening. It was the Mamata, known for her humane face, at the hospital who showered her affection and expressed concern over the health of the injured intern of NRS Hospital. \u201cKemon achho? Onek kostho hochhe? (How are you? Are you in much pain),\u201d asked the visibly moved Mamata. Paribaha had sustained a depressed fracture of the right frontal skull during the mob attack on Monday night. The intern was on duty at the emergency unit when a mob raided the hospital. He was immediately rushed to INK in a pool of blood. The CM looked at Paribaha\u2019s head injury. The wound had been kept open for healing. She was appalled that he had required 13 stitches. She also checked on the channel for IV fluid administration. \u201cI know how painful are these channels that have been put for IV fluid and medication. I myself had to undergo the same when I was admitted after being assaulted,\u201d the CM told Paribaha. The CM was accompanied by government officials, including state health secretary Rajiva Sinha. She spent close to 15 minutes interacting with Paribaha and doctors. \u201cIn addition to enquiring about Paribaha\u2019s health, the CM also assured him of all help and asked him not to worry about anything and that he would recover fully from the injury. Paribaha looked happy and assured,\u201d Sinha said. Even as Dr RP Sengupta, the chairman of INK told the CM that the hospital was ready to waive the Paribaha\u2019s treatment expenses, Banerjee appreciated the gesture but insisted that the government will bear the cost. \u201cKobe bari jete parbe (When can he go home)?\u201d Mamata asked Senguputa. She was told that the decision on his discharge will be taken in a few days. The CM left the hospital after wishing Paribaha a speedy recovery. Despite the skull bone fracture doctors said luckily, the bone had not broken into fragments and that the depressed bone had not caused a deep injury to the brain.

'Guess we all need safety at our work place, and doctors are no exception'03:01Director Kamaleswar Mukherjee shares his opinion on the ongoing doctors' strike in WB'\u2018I was a junior doctor, both at the Medical College and SSKM. People must realise that they are junior doctors, who are learning to deal with the patients and their families. There\u2019s a huge responsibility on their shoulders. I guess we all need safety at our workplace and doctors are no exception. During my stint, I didn\u2019t seen so much of cruelty from the patient\u2019s side. I feel those who commit such misdeeds should be arrested. The law enforcement should be strict, so that no one dares to tamper with the security system. Also, the government should have been more empathetic towards junior doctors. Demonstrating power never solves any problem. I guess the two parties should\u2019ve discussed and come up with a solution long back, so that work could have resumed faster. It\u2019s sad to see so many patients being deprived for so long\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s time when we should let our ego take a backseat and ensure doctors' safety\u2019\u2018I was once a junior doctor at the National Medical College, so I know the amount of stress and pressure they handle every day. In most government hospitals, it is always the junior doctors who take maximum work load. Tackling so many patients is not a joke. On top of that, they are asked several questions by the patient's family, who at times get restless and abusive. Personally, I haven't faced a situation like what happened at the NRS. Before beating up doctors, you should remember that they are the ones who save our lives. They sacrifice a lot to serve us. Juniors doctors are always on call at night, which is not an easy life to lead! They don't deserve such bashing. The incident that happened at NRS was inhuman. It's unfortunate that so much time has been wasted over venue selection instead of solving the problem of doctors' safety. It's time when we should let our ego take a backseat and ensure doctors' safety, so that doctors can start work immediately. There are so many patients, who depend on government hospitals for treatment.

Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

But till around 2.45pm, uncertainty loomed over the meeting as the doctors refused to relent and stuck to their demand that the proceeding be telecast live. The state government, which walked the extra mile to accommodate all demands to pave the way for the Nabanna meeting \u2014 including agreeing to videograph the event and even livestream it online\u2014 didn\u2019t agree to the live-telecast idea. It was finally at 2.45pm that the CM finally intervened and gave it a go-ahead. The meeting started at 4.05pm. Monday\u2019s soft stand was quite contrasting to what had happened last Thursday, when the CM\u2019s announced visit to SSKM Hospital and her four-hour deadline to end strike aggravated the situation. The doctors and the state appeared to be headed to a collision course with no resolution in sight. With the stir getting attention nationally, problems started cropping up for the government with political parties trying to fish in troubled waters. Till then, the government appeared to be rigid and inflexible. Mass resignations by senior doctors to show solidarity to the protest compounded the problem. The tide, however, started turning the day after. Senior party leaders Partha Chatterjee and Firhad Hakim on Friday took to social media to urge the doctors to resume work. Conspicuously absent in their pleas were words like \u201ctake strong action\u201d and \u201coutsider\u201d that the CM had said the day before. The administration appeared to have shrugged off its reluctance and made repeated outreach to the agitating doctors. State health secretary Rajiva Sinha, director of medical education (DME) Pradip Mitra and even senior faculties of medical colleges reached out to junior doctors to lend an ear to their grievances. To cloak its attempts with neutrality, five senior medics met the CM and stressed on the need for a dialogue. The administration finally made a complete turnaround and adopted a far more reconciliatory approach the day later \u2014 on Saturday. CM Banerjee not only spoke in detail on the Monday night vandalism and attack on junior doctors, she also spelt out the steps taken by her administration. She also went to the extent of suggesting that the doctors talk to her chief secretary and even the governor should they have any qualms to speak to her directly. The CM\u2019s plea and reconciliatory approach \u2014 where she was ready to discuss and act on all demands \u2014 clearly gave an impression that the junior doctors were stalling a \u201cgenuine effort\u201d to resolve the crisis. This appeared effective, forcing the agitators to reciprocate by dropping their key demand that the CM comes to NRS Hospital for discussions and agreeing to meet her in Nabanna. The state, which had initially strategised that the growing public opinion against the doctors\u2019 strike will force the agitators to relent, had initially misread the situation. The doctor\u2019s demands not only resonated statewide but got the backing of the medicla fraternity nationally. Realising this, the state government didn\u2019t aggravate the situation further but focussed to build bridges with the doctors. The week-long disruptions, however, required the state government to accede to another key demand \u2014 to live telecast the entire proceeding. The state administration was reluctant to it but the CM said, \u201cWhen I heard of this, I said why not? I always hold my administrative meetings in public. It is transparent and in full public view. So, I agreed to it immediately.\u201d With the CM\u2019s nod, DME Mitra didn\u2019t waste time to convince the students to take them to Nabbana in a state health department bus for the 1.5hour-long meeting. And the meeting, finally, helped resolve the crisis which had crippled the healthcare sector over the last seven days.

Hence we allowed him permission. \"However, he vaguely mentioned an 'extra act' which he did not clarify. We are investigating,\" a senior police officer said.

But at the same time, someone had to show them how and when to come out of the agitation as common people were suffering.

As many as 58 PG trainees and junior and senior doctors at MCH donated blood that will replenish the hospital\u2019s blood bank. The 58 units collected could be used mostly for thalassaemia patients, said doctors at the hospital. \u201cMost of the blood collected will go to thalassaemia patients in our hospital. Blood is scarce and it\u2019s important to ensure that our bank doesn\u2019t run out of supply. Thalassaemia patients need transfusion frequently.

Many of the junior doctors, including Shivani Shipra, Abhishek Koley, Soumaydeep Ghosh, Saswata Banejee and Souparna Saha, who were staging the demonstration, took a break to donate their blood. Some faculty members, including Dr Sabyasachi Das, professor of anaesthesia, too, donated blood. Besides donating blood, some junior doctors set up a table at the gate and attended to some critical patients.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Earlier, the agitators had insisted that chief minister Mamata Banerjee visit the city's NRS Medical College and Hospital, the epicentre of the agitation. After an internal meeting late on Saturday, the doctors, who had turned down an invite for a closed-door meeting with Banerjee at the state secretariat, mellowed down and stated that they were ready to hold a dialogue in any form, but the venue of the meeting would be decided later. \"We will be deciding on our next step during a governing body meeting today. We are open to any dialogue as always. The venue for the meeting will be decided soon,\" a spokesperson of a joint forum of junior doctors told reporters here. During a press conference at the state secretariat on Saturday, Banerjee urged the agitators to resume work and said her government had accepted all of their demands. She also stressed that a group of doctors had met her and expressed their willingness to join duty, a claim vehemently refuted by the striking doctors. During the meet, the chief minister emphasised that her government had not invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) to get the doctors to resume work. \"We have laws, but we do not want to use them.... We are not going to take any stringent action against any of the agitating junior doctors and hamper their career,\" she said after the agitators did not turn up for a meeting at 5pm.

Ultimately, it took one sentence from the \u201cabhibhabak (guardian)\u201d to end the stalemate in which doctors from across the country got involved. \u201cLokkhi chhelera, ebar tomra strike tule nao. Ekhane ektu mishti kore bolo, okhane giye ektu joralo golaye bolo (Now please withdraw your strike like good boys. Say it sweetly here even though you may have to say it a little more strongly once you return to your campus),\u201d Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, who represented their community, at a meeting in Nabanna on Monday evening. In the end, the junior doctors\u2019 insistence on a meeting in front of TV cameras \u2014 and the government\u2019s reluctant consent \u2014 turned out to be a masterstroke for Banerjee. The Bengal CM came out as the stateswoman \u2014 \u201cguardian and protector\u201d to the striking junior doctors (in their words) who calmly negotiated a tricky dialogue \u2014 in about 100 minutes of live TV broadcast that was watched with as much interest on the NRS campus in Kolkata as at AIIMS, New Delhi. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS last Monday (the incident that triggered the stir) and then escalated the pitch after Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday, relented in the face of some gentle persuasion and genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. What must have also played on their mind was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM\u2019s appeal for talks last weekend. The protesting doctors returned to NRS on Monday evening and, after another general-body meeting (that looked like a mere formality after the spontaneous applause that greeted the end of the meeting with the CM at Nabanna), came to say that one sentence that millions of patients depending solely on the state-run healthcare system were waiting for: \u201cWe hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\u201d Chants of \u201clakshmi chhele!\u201d immediately rang through the campus, replacing the cries of \u201cbahiragata (outsider)\u201d that had greeted IMA head and Trinamool MP Santanu Sen\u2019s comments about the presence of outsiders in the ranks of the striking doctors last week. The euphoria was preceded by the Nabanna meet, which discussed several serious issues even though almost everyone knew what the end result \u2014 the withdrawal of the strike \u2014 would be. They ranged from security issues \u2014 collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients\u2019 kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law-and-order \u2014 to the CM\u2019s suggestion for third-party PR professionals who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \u201coverworked doctors\u201d and \u201caggrieved patients\u2019 kin\u201d, as well as grievance cells for patients. \u201cWe are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM\u2019s caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us. We came here for a discussion because we wanted a solution. The chief minister\u2019s commitment has assured us that our concerns will be looked into and appropriate action will be taken against unwanted incidents,\u201d one of the junior doctors said after emerging from the meeting. \u201cWe respect doctors and teachers. They have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and strong action is taken if something happens,\u201d Banerjee said. The gentleness, however, came with the message that she could not be bullied into doing anything. Urged by the junior doctors to visit Paribaha Mukhopadhyay, the doctor whose skull had been dented in the attack last Monday, and visit the NRS campus, Banerjee said: \u201cKichhu jinish amader opor chhere dao. Tomra amake katha na dile ami Paribaha ke dekhte jete parchhi na. Tomra katha dao tomra kaje jog debe (Leave certain things to us. You are holding me back. I am unable to go to Paribaha till you assure me. Give me your word that you will resume duty),\u201d she said. The meeting went smoothly, but there were multiple hurdles in the build-up with junior doctors refusing to meet the CM at Nabanna till Saturday. Officials said it was director of medical education Pradip Mitra who played the crucial role of an interlocutor, defused the tension that had built up over the week and finally got the doctors to agree to meet the chief minister at the secretariat.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh.

Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Director of medical education Pradip Mitra has been adept at defusing tension on campus. A former director of IPGMER, Mitra enjoys the confidence of medical students and has been the face of the health establishment for more than a decade. It\u2019s his relentless effort from behind the curtains that contributed to doctors climbing down from their hard stance and laying down conditions to withdraw the ongoing agitation. Mitra was at NRS Hospital within hours of junior doctors launching their agitation last Tuesday. He pacified them, tried to reason with them and get them to agree to talk to the state administration. His efforts didn\u2019t yield any dramatic response from the agitating doctors, but he reportedly kept at it. He kept returning to NRS, the epicentre of the agitation, and was present to lend an ear to the young doctors whenever they aired their grievances. When the committee of five senior doctors comprising, Sukumar Mukherjee, Plaban Mukherjee, Alokendu Ghosh, Makhanlal Saha and Abhijit Chowdhury, went to Nabanna to meet chief minister Mamata Bnerjee last Friday, Mitra stayed back at NRS, sharing the junior doctors\u2019 concerns and listening to them patiently. Liked by students and young doctors alike, Mitra is a veteran in dealing with agitations. He has faced several as the IPGMER director till his seven-and-a-half year stint came to an abrupt end in 2015. Former students recall how he would never lose his cool even amid slogan-shouting. Mitra would, in fact, ask agitating students if they wished to gherao him. \u201cHe would manage to crack jokes with us even as we pressed him with our demands. With him around, you always had the confidence that the administration is sympathetic,\u201d a former student said. Mitra told TOI on Sunday that he had been a student and sympathized with their demands. \u201cJunior doctors are the backbone of any medical college, which can\u2019t function without these young medics. They work under tremendous stress and trying conditions. In crisis, they need to be dealt with patiently and in a friendly manner. That\u2019s what I have always tried,\u201d he said. On Sunday morning, too, the veteran pathologist spent time with the doctors before they convened a governing body meeting at NRS. According to junior doctors present at the meeting, he asked for permission to speak for three-four minutes before the meeting began at 11.30am. Mitra, in his address, called upon doctors to take a step towards solving the impasse, telling them that he realized their demands were reasonable, but the strike was not benefiting anyone and should be ended. He suggested that irrespective of the steps that the government took to protect them, doctors should form their own committee to review the situation at state hospitals. \u201cThey should meet every fortnight and if they are not satisfied, they can go to the principals or the MSVP. I am always there to talk to them and help,\u201d Mitra said.

More than 200 members of the LGBTQIA+ community marched the streets waving rainbow-coloured flags, shouting slogans, flaunting their painted nails and demanding equal love. At least 100 amateur photographers captured the walk with cameras in hand. The first edition of The Rainbow Frame \u2014 a pride and photo walk \u2014 was a celebration of those who are out and proud. Organised by Fotograf\u00eda-En, a Facebook community for amateur photographers, the walk aimed at celebrating the Pride Month \u2014 June \u2014 and build a healthy relationship between the LGBTQIA+ community members and the other strata of society. Aparajita Majumdar, the founder of the group and the main organiser of the walk, wore a big smile as she said, \u201cEvery year, in December, Kolkata witnesses a pride walk. But no one ever did it in June, which is called the Pride Month. So, we thought why not organise a walk, where people from outside the LGBTQIA+ community can also join in. You never know, this might start a new beginning for all of us,\u201d she said. WALK WITH PRIDE The walk was flagged off from Park Street at 2 pm. As slogans like \u201cAmar shorir amar mon; dur hok shob rajshashon (My body my mind; stop this interference),\u201d filled the air, there were claps, songs and unlimited cheering from the crowd. The sense of unity and pride was palpable. Cars came to a halt and curious passers-by dropped in to see what was going on. And as they learnt about the pride walk, a few joined in, clapping to the rhythm of the slogans. \u201cPeople are becoming more receptive. The pace may be slow, but the society has started understanding that we are just like them. Our sexual orientation or choice of gender does not make us any different. So, we can proudly come out of the closet and talk about our life\u2019s choices,\u201d said Atashi Nath, a participant, who has been living with her girlfriend in Kolkata for the past two years. MY LOVE IS JUST LIKE YOURS As the march reached the Exide crossing, several participants were seen shouting slogans as they held each other\u2019s hands. Among them were Aparna Gharami and Rama Deb. Aparna said they met two years ago via social media. \u201cDuring that time, we had different partners. Rama was subjected to abuse and mental torture by her partner and eventually came out of the relationship. During that time, I also had a breakup. Slowly, we became friends and then took the relationship to the next level,\u201d said Aparna, adding that they are looking for an accommodation and will move in together soon. \u201cInitiatives like these reassure us that we are not alone and give us strength. On the other hand, it educates common people about our community. Probably, these walks are the reason that we are getting courage to come out,\u201d said Rama. EXTEND A HELPING HAND Among the participants, there were those who came from different parts of the country just to root for members of the community. Ritika Maity from Gwalior and Chetna Khullar from Delhi were two such individuals. Chetna, who is not a queer community member, travelled to The City of Joy with her friend. \u201cI was really excited to hear about this initiative and couldn\u2019t help but participate. These walks work as a support system to many people. I am glad to be such a support,\u201d she added. BONDING OVER PHOTOGRAPHY As the march ended at Maidan after three hours, the photographers, who gathered for the walk, took a break and indulged in some adda. Few were seen sharing a laugh over bhanrer cha, while others simply sat on the ground and sang We Shall Overcome. They held hands as they made their voices heard. Pritam Sen, who participated in a pride walk for the first time, told us, \u201cI always wanted to come to a pride walk not just because it is a great subject for photography, but also because I really wanted to experience it. So, I was thrilled when I learnt about this on Facebook. Today, I will be returning home not just with some great shots but also some really good friends,\u201d he added.  Alivia Basu, a photographer and a transman, said the walk was an exercise in bonhomie. \u201cI like street photography because I can shoot without any human interaction. Today, when I was sharing frame and composition ideas with other photographers, I didn\u2019t feel any kind of uneasiness. It didn\u2019t occur to me what they would think or if they were out to judge me. I think this is the biggest takeaway from the walk,\u201d he added.

She was left there on Thursday night with no food or water and hardly had any memory. She was nervous and all she could do was cry through the night. A woman on Friday morning noticed her and uploaded her image on social media, following which Missionaries of Charity rescued her. Ranjita Sharma (22), a daily passenger who crosses Sealdah station, every day was moved by the woman\u2019s plight and asked her what had happened. \u201cShe could only tell me that her name was Lakshmi and that after her husband and son died, she had been forced to work as a domestic help at a house in Arambag. She was too ill to work anymore. So the people abandoned her here,\u201d Sharma said. Ranjita bought the lady a packet of biscuits, some puffed rice and bottles of water before going to work. \u201cShe wanted to eat rice. I was moved to tears.

The Bengal CM and her administration, which seemed to be on a collision course with the striking junior doctors till Friday afternoon (when she delivered her \u201coutsider\u201d speech in North 24 Parganas\u2019 Bijpur), radically altered their approach in the course of one evening and pulled off one of their biggest public-relations wins in recent memory, evident in the thunderous applause that followed the Nabanna meeting on Monday. Senior government officials told TOI on Monday that it was Friday\u2019s sequence of events that was critical to the turnaround. Banerjee went to SSKM hospital on Thursday, where she delivered her \u201coutsider\u201d jibe at striking doctors while taking up the cause of suffering patients. On Friday, at the North 24 Parganas meet, she repeated her \u201coutsider\u201d line around 2.30pm. It was also on Friday that several senior physicians made up their mind to resign from the state health service to follow in the footsteps of their junior colleagues, who had started tendering mass resignations as a mark of protest against the government. A few hours later, however, some of the same doctors \u2014 who were contemplating giving up their career in the public sector \u2014 were at Nabanna by Banerjee\u2019s side. Four of them were senior doctors \u201cheld in high esteem by the medical fraternity but also considered to be pillars of the government\u2019s healthcare set-up\u201d, officials said. Their senior, 83-year-old veteran physician Sukumar Mukherjee, made up the last member of the group of five. State director of medical education Pradip Mitra, anyway, had been the key negotiator with striking doctors. Together, these half-a-dozen senior physicians became the Banerjee government\u2019s intermediaries to reach out to agitators. The CM had, finally, found a key core group \u2014 made up of respected medical professionals who were also trusted by the establishment \u2014 to bridge the gap between the medical fraternity and the government. The DME\u2019s appeal to students to come to the negotiation table was followed by another appeal by the group of five. The CM played along, waiting patiently at Nabanna till 9pm on Friday, for the same doctors who were still issuing strong anti-government statements from the NRS campus. It was the same evening that doctors \u2014 and the rest of Bengal \u2014 heard Banerjee say (in an interview to a Bengali news channel): \u201cBehead me if you want but resume work.\u201d On Saturday, around 6pm, the CM followed it up with an offer that was difficult to refuse. She again asked \u201cwilling junior doctors\u201d even as she appealed to others \u201cin the name of humanity\u201d to resume work and promised that there would be no coercive action. \u201cAll issues\u201d would be up for discussion, Banerjee said. And, if they found her unacceptable, they could talk to the state chief secretary or even the governor (who had already met a group of striking doctors). The doctors, by this time, sensed that the continuing strike was turning public opinion against them. They, too, made a climbdown on Sunday \u2014 promising to talk at \u201cany time, any place\u201d \u2014 instead of insisting that the CM come down to NRS to talk. The stage had been set. Monday\u2019s meeting found a vintage Banerjee greeting the junior doctors: frank, warm, concerned about their safety and caring and, above all, having lots of patience. She listened more, spoke less and, when she did, she went directly to the point that the agitators wanted answers to. She appreciated a lot of suggestions, asked bureaucrats to note them down and take action and made the junior doctors feel at home, right down to an invite to sharing tea and snacks after the 100-minute negotiation. \u201cTomra bosho. Cha-ta khao. Ota type korte ektu samay lage. Hoye gele diye debe. Amar kono problem nei (Hang on for tea and snacks. It will take time to type the minutes of the meeting. You will get it when it is done. I have no problem,\u201d she said.  It was as if a doctor was speaking to her patients, trying to diagnose what was wrong and prescribing the right medicine. Before that, she had said what must have been music to the agitators looking for a way out of a week-long stalemate: \u201cI have condemned it (violence against doctors) earlier.

A retaining wall of the reservoir had collapsed in March. Members of Youth Association, which is organising the puja said there was \u201cless than one percent chance\u201d of shifting the puja out of Mohammad Ali Park if permission does not come through. The khuti puja was performed on Monday morning.

Guchait was not alone. Several patients and their relatives \u2014 even police personnel \u2014 joined junior doctors and interns at NRS to watch the meeting live between 31 representatives from government hospitals and the CM on a big television screen, especially set up in front of the enquiry enclosure of the hospital, so that everybody could watch the deliberations. Many patients and their relatives sat beside the junior doctors to watch the meeting on television. Big speakers were brought in, so that those who were unable to watch could at least hear the goings-on. Patients, their families, junior doctors, interns, Group D staff and even private security personnel joined in the jubilations when the junior doctors returned from Nabanna, indicating how desperate everybody was for this stalemate to end. People carried the doctors on their shoulders and took them to the academic building, shouting \u201cAmra lokkhi chhele (We are good boys)\u201d. Government hospitals had not been dispensing medical services \u2014 except emergency services \u2014 for the past one week due to a strike by junior doctors and interns in protest against a murderous attack on junior doctors, and demanding more security for themselves. One of their pre-conditions for the meeting was to broadcast the proceedings live. Guchait said: \u201cDoctors have been denying us treatment, so it was a big decision to join them. But a lot hinges on this meeting.\u201d \u201cHundreds of patients are lying unattended at NRS itself. Thousands are languishing in other hospitals. The condition is worse in the districts. I am hopeful that this meeting will throw up some solutions but also anxious, in case it doesn\u2019t.\u201d It was not only the patients and their relatives. Even the striking junior doctors knew how important the meeting was for their movement. From confrontational till Sunday to reconciliatory on Monday, there was a marked change inside the camp since the morning. From raising anti-administration slogans to talking in hushed tones, inquiring whether junior doctors are going to Nabanna for the meeting, the change in approach was evident. As soon as the bus ferrying 32 junior doctors left for Nabanna at 3.10pm, a big TV screen was set up. Junior doctors from all over the campus assembled to watch the proceedings. Many who could not get close to the TV started watching the live-stream on their mobile phones. \u201cWe want to make it clear that we do not want the patients to suffer. We feel the pain when we turn away somebody who needs our attention. But this time we had to put our foot down. We want to resume work as soon as possible. The public perception is changing. People who were earlier sympathetic towards our cause are starting to get upset. A lot hinges on this meeting, which will decide the future course of our movement,\u201d said Soumya Ghosh, an intern at NRS. The relation of trust and dependence between doctors and patients became the collateral damage of the strike. Though most people sympathised with the doctors\u2019 demands, they were upset at patients being denied treatment. As time lapsed and no hope of a breakthrough emerged, the public mood had started to change. \u201cTill now, the government would create a green corridor for transporting organs for donations and critically ill patients. Today, one was created to take the team of junior doctors to Nabanna. This itself shows how much was hinging on this meeting with the chief minister,\u201d said an intern after the representatives returned to a rousing welcome.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Though no report of death has reached the civic headquarters so far from the borough health offices, the civic top brass is worried over recurrence of the dreaded diseases in areas known as dengue-prone. Sources in the KMC health department said the situation could turn worse in absence of an anti-dengue drive by the KMC and state government at the earliest. A report has been sent to the state health department by the KMC health department signalling a dengue threat looming over large areas under five KMC boroughs and seeking help from the state for a combine drive to prevent a spurt in the cases during the approaching monsoon. TimesViewTaking guard in advance is important. Merely reacting after the problem is already at the doorstep may not help. There needs to be a proper plan of action to preempt an outbreak. And lessons need to be learnt from the past.Some of the areas, which have recorded dengue cases include, Taltata, Elliot Road, Park Circus, Tiljala, Ballygunge, Lake Gardens, Jodhpur Park Alipore, Behala, Tollygunge, Garia, Bijoygarh, Baghajatin, Jadavpur and some areas located off EM Bypass. According to a KMC health department official, many of these areas had seen a spurt in dengue cases last year and several dengue death cases were also reported from some of these areas. \u201cWe are extremely worried over reports of dengue from these areas this year too. What we need is a combined drive by different KMC essential departments and the state government health department must pitch in to help us. Once monsoon sets in, we will be on our toes to prevent spread of dengue from one area to the other,\u201d a senior official in the KMC health department said. The civic health department team combating dengue has expressed its helplessness over the lack of initiative on part of the state in solving issues that might mar dengue prevention drive if not tackled immediately. For example, a KMC health department official pointed out lack of initiative in cleaning garbage from several abandoned private buildings and government properties. A section of KMC councillors agreed timely action could save dengue-prone areas from disasters this year. Debasish Mukherjee a RSP councillor who represents areas like Sree Colony, Pallisree, Bangajatin and Vidyasagar Colony close to Ramgarh rued that several government properties like abandoned primary schools had become real breeding grounds for dengue mosquitoes. Mukherjee last had to combat the disease after a couple of dengue deaths from his ward (ward 98) and adjacent neighbourhood.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

At SSKM hospital in Kolkata, Raiganj-resident Samuel Haque, who was admitted with a cardiac problem, said he was uncertain about his treatment. His brother said, \"We came to Kolkata last Sunday when everything was normal and the outpatient department was functioning. We admitted him on an emergency basis, with doctors giving date on Tuesday for check-up, following which the date of surgery was to be decided.\" But now no doctor is attending to Haque, he said. Senior doctors say they don't have enough hands to conduct tests, he said. \"His condition is deteriorating. We cannot take him home because it is very difficult for my brother to travel long distance in trains. We will wait till Monday.\" Services in emergency wards, outdoor facilities and pathological units of many hospitals have been hit. The doctor's strike began after two of their colleagues were assaulted at the NRS Medical College and Hospital by family members of a patient, who died on Monday night. They demand adequate security. Hundreds of doctors have resigned en masse in support of their colleagues. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has urged the junior doctors to return to work and said her government had accepted their demands. But the doctors have demanded a dialogue with the government before ending their stir. The strike has caused immense trouble for patients. Joydeb Roy, a resident of Barishat in North 24 Parganas district, was admitted to R G Kar hospital in Kolkata with an injured leg. A relative said he was referred to a government hospital, where he had to undergo surgery to place a metallic plate in his leg on an emergency-basis. He is waiting for the surgery. \"The senior doctors are saying they need help of junior doctors to conduct the surgery. My husband is lying in the department (ward) waiting for treatment,\" Roy's wife said. Junior doctors are the mainstay of any state-run college-hospital. Mokhtar Hussain's family members are planning to return home in Basirhat. They have been waiting for two days at the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital for treatment to resume for Hussain, a cancer patient. \"I am suffering from high fever for seven days. I cannot bear the pain. But there is no doctor to carry out check-up. The OPD has been shut for two days and I cannot go anywhere else as things are the same there as well. I don't know what to do. I cannot spend this much money to stay here in Kolkata. I will go back home,\" he said. Family members of the four-year-old Romita Dhar, a thalassaemia patient, too face a similar dilemma. When Dhar's family took her to Chittaranjan National Medical College and Hospital for check-up on Friday, they were told to come on Saturday. \"It is very difficult to travel with a child who is suffering from thalassaemia. I'll again come next week,\" her mother Arundhaty Roy said. The patients admitted in government hospitals are also facing problems with pathological units not functioning as usual. \"We don't have much money to afford treatment at private hospitals. I appeal to the chief minister to find a solution to this problem. \"Why cannot our chief minister come for a meeting with the doctors...

The body was identified by the magician\u2019s brother. Meanwhile, a police probe \u2014 with help from reputable magicians \u2014 established that Lahiri, known as Mandrake, had made several mistakes while performing on Sunday. The cops were initially reluctant to confirm if the body that was found was indeed Lahiri. \u201cAnother man had died at a spot close to where Lahiri disappeared and we want to ensure we have a positive identity,\u201d DC (Port) Syed Waquar Raza had said.

Magician P C Sarkar, who is a master of such stunts, remarked that perhaps Lahiri had \u201cneeded a little more practice\u201d. Lahiri\u2019s team, too, waited about 15 minutes after the magician was lowered into the water to raise an alarm. Cops indicated they wanted to investigate whether Lahiri took help of some lacunae on part of the administration and probably paid for it with his life. \u201cA case of negligence is likely to be registered,\u201d said a source .

Nadda's appointment as working president was on the cards after he was not inducted into the government. Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Congratulations to him on becoming the working president of the party,\" the Prime Minister added. Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister said an active and effective opposition is a necessity in a democracy and pointed out that a well- argued and factual criticism of the government strengthens democracy. \"Sometimes such positive contributions are not noticed as they do not get high TRPs,\" he said. Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said. Referring to his recent speeches, the Prime Minister said that \"we started with ' sab ka saath, sab ka vikas', but the people have added an unprecedented 'vishwas' (trust) to the matter\". He said Monday marks the the start of the first session after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. \"I welcome all new MPs. With them comes new hope, new aspirations and new determination to serve,\" he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

Sunday being a holiday, the out-patient departments remained closed and the number of patients waiting outside hospitals or visiting the emergency wards was also low. The emergency services, however, functioned normally. The striking doctors across hospitals were looking forward to a General Body meeting to be held at the NRS Medical College and Hospital, the epicentre of the protests. The meeting, which will decide the next course of action, will also be attended by representatives of other hospitals participating in the strike. According to informed sources, the protesting doctors are probably looking for a scope of discussion to end the stalemate. On Friday night, the striking doctors rejected Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's proposal for talks at the state Secretariat, instead asking her to come down to NRS Hospital. West Bengal Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi wrote to Banerjee advising her to take immediate steps to provide security to the doctors and asking her to take them into confidence. She responded saying that the government was taking required action. \"The protest is not just about CCTV, armed security and iron gates.

Even though their OPDs will remain open, most private hospitals expect few doctors to attend. Patient turnout, too, will be consequently low, they believe. Half the doctors at a private hospital off EM Bypass has already taken leave from their outdoor duties on Monday. Patient attendance across private hospital OPDs dropped since the doctors\u2019 stir began last Tuesday. At Ruby General Hospital, the authorities apprehend that less than 50% doctors would report to work on Monday. \u201cIt will affect the services and we expect a thin patient attendance, too. OPD services have remained affected for the last five days and Monday could be the worst,\u201d said GM, operations, Subhashish Dutta. Medica Superspecialty Hospital authorities, too, think that most doctors would stay away. \u201cThis strike call was given a couple of days ago, so the response will be good. Most doctors are likely to join the cease-work on Monday and we can\u2019t insist they report to work. But we will try and ensure that all patients get attended to,\u201d said CEO Alok Roy. Outdoor services at all the three units of AMRI Hospitals are likely to come to a halt. The hospital is, however, making arrangements to attend to critically ill patients at its outdoors. \u201cAll our emergency staff and staff doctors will be present. If necessary, we will take their help to attend to serious patients. But most OPD doctors are likely to be absent on Monday and it will affect services,\u201d said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. He added that around 70% doctors could join the cease-work. \u201cWe expect our doctors to inform us on Monday morning about their decision,\u201d he said. AMRI receives around 800 OPD patients across its three centres at Mukundapur, Salt Lake and Dhakuria. During last week\u2019s OPD strike call, patient attendance had dropped to 30%. It could slide further on Monday, felt Barua. An AMRI Hospitals consultant, who had joined the cease-work on Wednesday, said he feared OPDs would collapse on Monday. \u201cThe agitation has gained momentum over the last three days. The entire medical community is now rallying around junior doctors. While last Wednesday, the number of OPD patients was slightly fewer than normal, this time, the facilities could be deserted,\u201d he said. Apollo Gleneagles Hospital CEO Rana Dasgupta refused to speculate on doctor attendance and said the hospital authorities were keeping their fingers crossed. A consultant with the hospital, however, felt that none of the doctors might report for duty at the outdoor on Monday. \u201cThe situation has gone from bad to worse. This is a national strike and all Kolkata doctors will take part. Outdoor services are likely to come to a standstill at private hospitals,\u201d he said. Belle Vue Clinic received just 55 outdoor patients, instead of the normal 300, during the OPD strike last Thursday. But patient count improved on Friday and Saturday. It is set to slide again on Monday.  \u201cWe have not been informed of any cease-work by doctors but the patient and doctor attendance indeed dropped last Thursday,\u201d said CEO P Tondon.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

The father, Raju, a garage mechanic, said he was happy with the name that his uncle-in-law and mother-in-law, Chhaya Santra, came up with. Rupali from West Midnapore\u2019s Kespur was admitted to MMCH\u2019s gynaecological ward on the evening of June 10. Within hours, she underwent a caeserian section and the boy was born.

They held a sit-in in front of the MMCH principal\u2019s office all day on June 11. But Rupali and her baby were examined by senior doctors, who stepped in to fill the void left by junior doctors. Rupali said, \u201cI was fine. My baby had some minor complications. A child specialist examined him and prescribed treatment. My child overcame these complications soon. I learnt a day later that a strike was on within the hospital, but that did not imapct my baby or me. Our treatment went on normally with senior doctors routinely examining us. But I heard from relatives that some other patients were affected.\u201d MMCH professor of gynaecology Sabyasachi Ray said, \u201cI was in charge of the gynaecology ward on the night the baby was born.

Singh\u2019s switchover is the third instance of desertion from the Trinamool camp in Bengal after the Lok Sabha polls. Sunil, who is also the chairperson of Garulia municipality, took the BJP flag in the presence of BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and BJP leader Mukul Roy. Sunil had with him 12 TMC councillors of the 21-member civic body, establishing a majority in Bhatpara, Kancharapara, Naihati, Halisahar and Garulia municipalities where the ruling Trinamool had an unchallenged sway. Sunil joining BJP brings entire Barrackpore under the watch of its MP, Arjun Singh.
