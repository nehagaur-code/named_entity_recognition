If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Congratulations to him on becoming the working president of the party,\" the Prime Minister added. Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president. Nadda has long experience of the party organisation as he was the in-charge of the party headquarters and is a popular figure.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh.

Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The hearing in the case is likely to come up on Monday. In a PIL filed before the high court on Friday, petitioner Rakshit Joshi said that hundreds of tents are being set up in the eco-sensitive region while permission has been granted only for a few. He added that such a high-profile wedding will generate tonnes of garbage causing much damage to the environment apart from other violations by the businessmen. Hence, Joshi requested the court to direct the state government to conduct an environmental assessment and seek compensation from Gupta brothers for the damage caused. The petition also stated that the state government has taken no steps to conserve the pristine alpine meadows despite clear directions by the high court. Last year, the HC had directed the state government to consider declaring all alpine meadows and high-altitude valleys as national parks or sanctuaries. It had also ordered the removal of all permanent structures in the region and banned overnight stay citing it a threat to the fragile ecosystem.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs.

Officials of state health department claim that the shortage is due to less import. Speaking to TOI, SK Sah, medical superintendent of Sonam Singh Jina Government Base Hospital in Haldwani, said, \"Not only the Kumaon region but the state of Uttar Pradesh and other north Indian states are also facing a shortage of anti-rabies vaccine. This is due to the delay in the import (from China) of an important ingredient of the vaccine.\u201d Medical practitioners of the region said that if the shortage continues for more than a week, they will be bound to travel to Delhi to get anti-rabies vaccine.

Except for Matador mini buses, there are hardly any other public transport options available to take people from Roorkee to nearby villages. These buses ply on two major routes \u2014 the Kaliyar route and the Manglaur route. And while these mini buses have been the sole public transport mode since the \u201990s, the service suffers from a range of issues, including overloading and poor maintenance of buses, among others. At present, an average of 8,000 passengers travel through the Kaliyar and Manglaur route on a daily basis but only 24 mini buses ply on the Roorkee-Purkazi route (via Manglaur) and only 35 buses run on the Roorkee-Roshnabad route (via Kaliyar). The lack of buses, say observers, is what leads to overloading. Further, the buses suffer from shoddy maintenance. Broken window glass panes, rickety old seats, torn seat cushions, rusted grab-handles, dimly-lit or damaged head and tail lights and poorly functional engines are common issues with these vehicles. Commuters also allege that these buses take a lot of time to cover even a short distance. \u201cKaliyar is just 8 kilometres away from Roorkee but the mini bus takes around 50 minutes for the journey. The reason is that bus drivers wait for the bus to overload before starting the trip,\u201d said Anwar Rana, a Piran Kaliyar resident. Also, there are hardly any passenger stands on the route. As a consequence, the commuters are forced to take refuge from the scorching heat or rain in the nearby shops while waiting for the bus. This is something that is also acknowledged by bus operators. \u201cThere is no passenger stand on the Kaliyar route due to which the commuters are incovenienced especially during bad weather conditions,\u201d Vinod Puri, president of mini buses\u2019 owners association told TOI. Meanwhile, Jyoti Shankar Mishra, Roorkee transport officer when queried about the issue, told TOI, \u201cDue to the ongoing Char Dham Yatra, we are busy checking vehicles coming from other states.

The word \u201cKainchi\u201d (scissors) for the dham is used to describe two sharp \u201chairpin\u201d bends of the roads.  Kainchi Dham had shot into the limelight after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, in an interaction with PM Modi at the Facebook headquarters in 2015, mentioned that he had visited an Indian temple on the suggestion of Apple founder Steve Jobs. The temple was later presumed to be Kainchi dham.  Jobs had visited Kainchi Dham Ashram in the 70s but didn\u2019t find Neem Karauri Baba there.  The temple\u2019s present structure was built gradually over the years after its inauguration on June 15, 1964. In 1962, the ascetic, who died on September 10, 1973, built a chabutara (platform). The current temple is based on that foundation, along the bank of Shipra river.  Popular fables recite that the saint left his home in 1958 when his youngest daughter was all of 11 years old. Total 108 temples dedicated to him are also built at several other places across the country and the world, including Lucknow and Texas, USA.

Six years down the line, a lot has been achieved in form of reconstruction and infrastructure. However, a lot still remains to be done as over 3,500 dead are yet to be traced, properly planned chopper services remain a challenge, and accommodating high number of pilgrims and facilities remain a concern for the authorities. Experts have also raised concern over the large-scale construction work in the valley and have termed it as an effort to \u201cdevelop a concrete jungle\u201d at Kedarnath. For the reconstruction work at Kedarnath, Rs 300 crore has already been used. Houses for 40 priests have been constructed and the work is on to complete the houses for 73 others. Retaining wall and banks have been constructed along Mandakini and Saraswati rivers. Earlier, the approach road to the temple was merely six to seven feet wide but it has now been increased to 50 feet. A grand entrance plaza greets the pilgrims who take the 50-feet-wide and 278-metre-long approach road to reach the shrine.The temple platform area had been increased from 27,000sqft to 41,000sqft. A safety wall has also been constructed behind the shrine. Rudraprayag district magistrate Mangesh Ghildiyal, who has been monitoring the development works, said, \u201cIt is because of the hard work put in by the entire team that the number of devotees is on the rise with the each passing year. We are ensuring better facilities and medical attention to pilgrims coming from different parts of the country.\u201dHe added that there are some sectors that still need attention. \u201cWe need more toilets as number of pilgrims is increasing. Accommodation facilities also need to be improved,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Congress MLA from Kedarnath Manoj Rawat said that a lot more needs to be done. \u201cI fail to understand why the BJP government is yet to come up with a proper policy for helicopter services on Kedarnath route. People are struggling to get ticket, there is no proper system, online tickets are always booked and there is a state of utmost confusion here. This year, the chopper services started a week after the yatra began,\u201d he said. He added that the damage done to fabricated huts by heavy snowfall has \u201ccompounded the miseries of the pilgrims. \u201cUnder freezing conditions, people are being made to stay in tents.\u201d He added that more efforts were required to find the dead. \u201cSo many people come in search for their loved ones. Planned campaigns are required to give them closure.\u201d Hridayesh Joshi, who has covered the tragedy extensively as a mediaperson and also written a book on it, said, \u201cFor me, the biggest concern is the move to develop the area as a concrete jungle. Do we require this sort of construction at Kedarnath? How much good is it doing to the ecology?\u201d He added, \u201cThe excessive use of helicopters and heavy machines is also not good for the environment.\u201d For the past few years, the state government has also been aiming to set up three Doppler radars in the state for accurate weather forecast in order to be better equipped to handle flash floods like situations.  On the progress on that front, Bikram Singh, regional met director, said, \u201cWe are optimistic of setting up the radar at Mukteshwar in July and at Surkanda in the next two months.\u201d He added that the third radar at Pithoragarh would also be installed within this year.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Kumbh 2021 in Haridwar will be historic: Trivendra Singh Rawat": {"description": "HARIDWAR: Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Sunday met Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) seers in Haridwar to discuss the preparations for the Maha Kumbh fair to be held in the holy city in 2021.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister said an active and effective opposition is a necessity in a democracy and pointed out that a well- argued and factual criticism of the government strengthens democracy. \"Sometimes such positive contributions are not noticed as they do not get high TRPs,\" he said. Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said. Referring to his recent speeches, the Prime Minister said that \"we started with ' sab ka saath, sab ka vikas', but the people have added an unprecedented 'vishwas' (trust) to the matter\".

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends.

I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency.

It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood.

She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony.

Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life.

Tired of the perennial water crisis, the villagers are signing a \u2018water conservation pledge\u2019 to save at least 1,000 litres of rainwater per person during monsoon. The scarcity of water is hitting them hard - from quitting agriculture due to scarce water for irrigation to migrating. Fetching water from the base of hills is another cause of distress this summer. \u201cIn Uttarakhand, hilltops are devoid of water. As a result, we failed in getting good agricultural produce this year too. We are tired of drawing water from the base of hills. No more suffering due to shortage of water. I along with my younger brother have already made three ponds to conserve at least 3,000 litres of water during rains. We are also motivating our schoolmates to contribute in saving water,\u201d said Deepa Rawat (13) from Chaubatakhal, Pauri Garhwal. In Pokhra block of Pauri Garhwal, villagers have migrated, leaving behind just a handful land which is not helping the earth in soaking water. \u201cVillagers have migrated, and barely 8 % to 9 % land is under farming due to which water is not seeping through the earth\u2019s crust, thus, the water table has severely receded in the hills. The resources of water are constantly depleting. So, this movement was a major requirement for Himalayas,\u201d said Surender Singh Rawat, block pramukh, Pokhra, Pauri. While Pauri Garhwal (456 hectares) has witnessed its maximum forest cover getting burnt in wildfires this year after Almora (786 hectares) district, villagers are a worried lot as they feel forest fires are among top reasons behind parched summers. \u201cWater is fast evaporating in the blaze. So, forget good summers in hills now. The first layer of soil gets burnt, literally sucking up the moisture of soil. And in rainy season, the dry, useless soil gets washed away, so even during rainy season the forest is unable to soak the rainwater. We have to conserve water up here in the hills to save our ecology or else we will be forced to migrate as well,\u201d said Parvesh Kumar Sundriyal, member, district council, Pauri Garhwal. The drive which was taken up on this year\u2019s World Environment Day (June 5) has garnered support from villagers in need and hope of relief. \u201cThe fact that 500 people from various parts of hills have already committed towards water conservation through the pledge shows the dire situation in the hills. It is a myth that hills are safe from water scarcity, staying up here shows the grim reality of summers when villagers walk several kilometers just to fetch drinking water,\u201d said Sudhir Sundriyal, founder, Feel Good organisation which is motivating people to conserve water in the hills of Uttarakhand. Majority of government schools are being roped in by villagers and experts so that students understand the essence and urgency to save water. Each student is being motivated to dig at least two feet deep reservoir having at least two metre width and length.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Shah, 23, is already an engineering graduate and took the GATE challenge to improve his CV which could fetch him a decent job. He has no intention to go out of Uttarakhand to join a PG engineering course and until he gets a job of his choice inside the state, he would stay put at his family shop of 'chai-pakora' in Piplakoti village on Rishikesh-Barinath Road. Shah achieved 8000th rank in the GATE and is hopeful that it would help him getting a job with Tehri Hydro Development Corporation Limited (THDC) which he is trying ever since he finished his graduation in engineering from a government institute in Kothiyalsain. Although the shop was started by his father, Sagar now runs it. His father is ill and he has spared his brother to concentrate on his studies. He opens it at the break of dawn and runs it till late evening, logging 12 to 13 hours every day. This routine continued even when was preparing for the GATE examination. \"Morning hours are especially crowded as people here love deep-fried pakoras for the first meal,\u201d Shah said. He started assisting his father 15 years ago and had to take command when his father fell ill when he was doing BTech. Sagar completed his schooling from government inter college in his own village where he was just an average student. It was followed by a diploma at a polytechnic collge in Dehradun and then B Tech Kothiyalsain. \u201cSince there was no one to help the family in my village I came back and decided to study here after finishing BTech,\u201d he said. While running his shop, he decided to take GATE, his engineering degree didn't get his good offers. \"I was told by several people that clearing GATE would help me, so I decided to crack it,\" he says, adding\"I would study at least two hours daily after closing the shop,\u201d he said. Burning the midnight oil finally bore fruits when the young engineer finally cleared the exams. Despite success, he has no dearth of complaints. \u201cThe quality of education is not good enough to help you clear examinations like GATE. I believe my ranking suffered because of that. There is no coaching, no good college and even after clearing the exam, I do not think that there are enough jobs,\u201d he said.

And as almost 80% of the public transport vehicles are pressed into service on the Char Dham route, lack of commuting options has left locals of the region in a lurch. The transport crisis comes despite 2,500 registered taxis plying in the Garhwal region. Speaking to TOI, Harikrishna Kanswal, Garhwal taxi union president, said, \u201cIt is rather difficult for the taxi drivers to manage their expenses within the lean earnings they make from transporting locals. The pilgrimage season helps the taxi drivers earn a decent living which is why taxi operators are keen on plying on the Char Dham Yatra route.\u201d Among all the districts of the division, Uttarkashi, where the Gangotri and Yamunotri shrines are located, is the worst impacted as only 300 taxis are currently plying on the intra-city routes. \u201cWe have around 1450 taxis in the district but 1150 out of them are plying on the Char Dham Yatra route. The remaining 300 taxis are not sufficient to fulfill the transportation requirements of the district,\u201d Arjun Bhandari, president, district taxi union, told TOI. Similar is the case with public buses in the district. \u201cAt present, 35 out of the total 62 public buses are operating on the Char Dham Yatra route and the remaining 27 are plying on other routes of Uttarkashi district. Due to this, we are not able to provide bus services in areas like Gorsali, Barsu and Bangaun. Also, we have not been able to provide bus services in Assi Ganga valley region and a few other routes due to lack of enough passengers and poor condition of roads,\u201d Gajpal Rawat, president of Tehri Garhwal motor owners union, told TOI.  Locals say that this situation is not new. \u201cIt happens quite often. Most of the taxis which are the only mode of transport for many of us get involved in the yatra and we are stuck,\u201d said Ajay Bisht, a resident of Pauri Garhwal district. When queried, Chakrapani Mishra, ARTO Uttarkashi, told TOI, \u201cDifficult terrain has been among the major causes behind the transportation woes, especially in hilly areas.

While many hospitals cancelled surgeries, others refused to treat regular patients, forcing the district government hospitals to increase their OPD timings to cater to the influx of patients. The private hospitals had decided to keep their OPDs shut from Monday 6 am till Tuesday 6 am. City-based Shri Mahant Indiresh Hospital (SMIH) however didn\u2019t participate in the strike. \u201cKeeping the convenience of patients in mind, we decided not to participate in the strike. All emergency and OPD services ran as usual at our hospital,\u201d said Bhupendra Raturi, PRO, SMIH. Doctors at government hospitals in the city also observed a partial strike. At Government Doon Medical College Hospital (GDMCH), the doctors started OPD at 10 am against the regular timing of 8 am. \u201cMany doctors avoided OPD from 8 am to 10 am on Monday, but a few opted not to take part in the strike. Seeing the heavy influx of patients, I extended the OPD timings. The patients were treated till 3 pm,\u201d said Dr KK Tamta, chief medical superintendent, GDMCH. Meanwhile, the strike caught many patients by surprise. \u201cMy mother was complaining of joint pain since Saturday night. I couldn\u2019t take her to a doctor on Sunday as the clinics were closed. I took her to Max Hospital initially, but the OPD was closed. Next day, I also visited private orthopaedics clinics, but they, too, were on strike,\u201d said Vinay Singh, who works at a security agency. The IMA had announced withdrawal of non-essential medical services for 24 hours in support of the striking junior doctors in West Bengal. Speaking to TOI, IMA\u2019s state president Dr BS Judge said that the safety of doctors has been a matter of great concern and it needs to be addressed on priority. \u201cA proper law against assault on doctors has been our long-standing demand. This time, the government must ensure that some strong legal action is taken against all the accused who have hit the doctors in West Bengal,\u201d he added.

The frequency data is then sent to a central server which is monitored by the patrolling teams. A geophone is a ground motion transducer that is used by geophysicists and seismologists to convert ground movement into voltage. Speaking to TOI, Bivash Pandav, senior scientist, Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, said, \u201cWe used movements of elephants at Rajaji National Park to gauge the effectiveness of the device. The geophones gave us a specific kind of signal whenever an elephant came close to the railway tracks. We are using the Earthquake Warning System which is deployed alongside Delhi metro lines.\u201d The pilot project, aimed at minimizing elephant deaths along railway tracks, is being conducted between Kansro and Motichur railway stations. Notably, 26 incidents of elephant deaths have been reported in the past three decades on this stretch, infamous as the \u2018killer track\u2019. \u201cWe have so far installed about ten geophones at varied distances within 200 metres alongside the Kansro railway station. Now, we are planning to install geophones alongside the entire railway track passing through the Rajaji National Park area,\u201d added Pandav. To ensure that the alert sent by the geophone is of the movement of an elephant and not any other animal, hi-tech infra-red cameras are also installed along railway tracks. \u201cTo corroborate the signature sent by geophones, we have infra-red cameras which send us the images too. A robust Wi-Fi system is also being developed so that the data is simultaneously transmitted from central servers to train drivers and the patrolling staff,\u201d said PK Patro, director, Rajaji National Park. Meanwhile, scientists have maintained that the device doesn\u2019t do away the need of physical patrolling of the tracks. \u201cThe device can only send signal of the presence of an elephant but ultimately the patrolling staff has to remove the pachyderm from the railway track as soon as information is disseminated,\u201d cautioned Pandav.
