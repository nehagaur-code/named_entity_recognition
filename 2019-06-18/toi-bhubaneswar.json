If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

According to the recent Crime Branch letter to the SPs, a number of instances were reported where accused persons escaped from the police custody during their transit for appearance in the court. Crime Branch sources said at least 9 arrested persons escaped from the police custody in connection with separate crimes in 2018. \u201cIn cases of heinous offences, including Naxalism, it is a challenge for the police to safely produce the accused persons in court,\u201d additional director general of police (Crime Branch) Santosh Upadhyay said. The Crime Branch\u2019s concern assumes significance as an alleged Maoist had escaped from the police custody in Nuapada district last year, leaving the police red-faced. Manoj Madkami, who was arrested by Nuapada district police in May 2018, jumped the police custody from court premises on September 18, 2018. Madkami is still on the run. The incident had happened when Madkami was being taken back to jail from the court. At least seven cops were suspended for negligence and dereliction of duty. In order to avoid escape of hard core criminals, the Crime Branch has suggested the SPs to produce the former in court through electronic video linkage. Crime Branch said the concerned police stations should move the court, seeking approval to produce the accused via video conference. \u201cWe have electronic video linkage in the jails and courts. Since arrested persons are compulsorily produced in court in regular interval, the apprehension of their escape cannot be ruled out. Police stations should not take the risk of transporting dreaded criminals to court and use the technology for their safe appearance before the judge,\u201d another Crime Branch officer said.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

To make it work, the government approved increasing MBBS seats in the state by 150 and post graduate (MD/MS) intake by 148. But the final call on increasing the exact number of seats would be taken by the Medical Council of India\u2019s (MCI)s board of governors, sources said. \u201cThe government has given in-principle approval for the proposal to implement the quota. Further modalities will be worked out soon,\u201d health secretary Pramod Meherda told TOI. Sources said the government has given its nod to increase MBBS seats at Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Education and Research (VIMSAR), Burla, by 50 from its current capacity of 150. Similarly, 25 seats are going to be added to each of the medical colleges in Koraput, Baripada, Balasore and Balangir, taking the total intake to 125. The move follows a Union government directive wherein 10% EWS quota in general category needs to be implemented in higher education institutions. With the admission process under NEET scheduled to start soon, the states had to send their proposals to the MCI so that they can sync the intake capacity in various medical institutions with the Centre\u2019s rules. Since the number of seats at SCB Medical College, Cuttack and MKCG Medical College and Hospital, Berhampur are already 250 each \u2014 the maximum allowed to any medical college under MCI norms \u2014 increasing their intake would not be possible, a government official said. The state has also given its nod to increase post graduate seats at SCB, MKCG and VIMSAR by 148. If the MCI board approves the proposal, the number of MBBS seats in state-run medical institutions will go up from 1,050 to 1,200 and PG intake from 468 to 616. The state had to come up with a revised proposal after withdrawing an earlier approval on seat increase sent to the MCI board on June 4 as the same was not as per the medical education regulator\u2019s suggested formula. In the withdrawn approval, the state had suggested increasing MBBS seats by 105 and PG seats by 50.

The department is preparing a detailed school-wise database based on the performance of children in the matric examination, he said. Official sources said while 82 schools in the state have scored nil results in the class X boards this year, in over 1,400 schools, students failed in one or more subjects. School and mass education minister Samir Ranjan Dash had told that he would personally visit the schools with nil results and find out the reason for the poor performance. This year, as many as 5,87,720 students took the annual high school certificate examination of whom 3,97,125 students cleared the exam with a pass percentage of 70.78. Among the passed out students around 1, 22,062 have secured less than 40% marks. According to an official, the no detention policy up to Class VIII is one of the reasons for a large number of students scoring low marks in matric exam. \"Due to the no fail policy till Class VIII according to the Right to Education Act, there has been a drop in quality and in upper classes students face difficulties in grasping subjects leading to low scores,\" said Rajanikant Rout, a retired schoolteacher. The state government is planning to conduct an assessment test of students in the beginning of Class IX so that more focus can be given on weaker students by taking remedial measures and conducting extra classes for them. The assessment test will be conducted for mathematics, English and science subjects. Those who score less than 50% in the test will have to attend extra or remedial classes before the beginning of the session, the officer said. The parent-teacher meeting will be conducted in every 45 days instead of every six months.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath.

In the simultaneous polls, the BJD won in 112 of 147 assembly seats and 12 of 21 LS seats while the BJP got 23 assembly seats and 8 LS seats.

When she does, she clutches a pillow for comfort. While a few months ago, her face would light up at the sight of the Puri beach, now even the mention of it sends a shiver down her spine. Like Visakha, thousands of children in Odisha are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) more than a month after cyclonic storm Fani hit the state on May 3. In Puri, where the cyclone made landfall and damage was the greatest, more than 10,000 children below 17 years of age are undergoing psychosocial counseling after they started showing symptoms ranging from anxiety and stress to insomnia. Experts have warned that it might take a long time for an entire generation to overcome the mental trauma they have suffered in the aftermath of Fani which claimed 64 lives. At least 300 counselors from six non-profit organisations - aided by the government - have set up temporary centres in Puri alone to provide mental health intervention to affected children. While much of the infrastructure damaged by Fani is being rebuilt and those displaced have returned home, memories of the raging storm still haunt them. \"We were without food, power and water for several days. I never want to live through that again,\" Soumendra, a 12-year-old boy, who has been undergoing counseling, told TOI. Having come face-to-face with the monstrosity of the sea, he is scared to venture out alone. \"I feel safe here. The sound of the waves crashing onto the shore disturbs me,\" he said. It is this fear that gives Soumendra sleepless nights, a common symptom of PTSD. \"Children with PTSD fear that they would have to go through the same experience. If the anxiety persists for a prolonged period, they may slip into acute depression,\" Suvendu Mishra, general secretary of Indian Psychiatric Society (Odisha state branch), said. Mishra added that around 35% to 40% of the children in affected areas showed such symptoms and it may take anything between three and six months to fully recover.

The Gujarat government has launched a massive evacuation exercise to shift people from low-lying areas. \"The chief secretary of Gujarat had called up to discuss measures that need to be taken before the cyclone makes landfall.

He added that authorities from Gujarat had sought advice on the evacuation process and the Odisha's experience in dealing with cyclones like Fani and Titli. He said Gujarat officials are in constant touch with Odisha's disaster management authorities. Odisha recently drew praise from both within and outside the country for successfully evacuating more than 12 lakh people to safety before the extremely severe Cyclone Fani hit the state on May 3. This resulted in reducing human casualty. The state has built around 900 multi-purpose cyclone shelters in coastal districts and has 20 well-trained units of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) ready with modern equipment at their disposal to tackle disasters.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

And if their indigenous rain forecast method is anything to go by, the state is going to get a good monsoon this year with plentiful rain for three months. This prediction was made on Saturday by tribal priests during the Birpani Parab, a festival during which rituals are performed to predict the annual rainfall and appease the Birapani deity for a good harvest. It's a festival that falls on a Saturday, on the sixth or the tenth day of the lunar month of Jyestha, where thousands from the Paraja, Halwa, Pentia and Bhumia tribes, dressed up in their traditional attire, gather at the Kodanmali hilltop near Gadapadar village under Jeypore block to appease the goddess. The place of worship is marked by three water holes set in a straight line with rough circular openings. According to tribal beliefs, the first and the second holes symbolise Birpani and Dongar Dei. The third one symbolises Bhairab-the attendant of the two goddesses. It is believed that one of the three holes belonging to the deity (Birpani) pumps out water from the earth and the force with which the water gushes out indicates the arrival of rain. \"I insert my right hand into the hole to feel the quantity of water and its intensity. It is on the basis of these observations that I predict the onset of the monsoon and the quality of harvest,\" says Bhagaban Bhumia, the chief priest. \"We have been following this tradition since times immemorial and our prediction has never gone wrong. This year, the state will receive good rain for three months,\" he adds. Jeypore MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati says the tribal priests predicting the quantity of rainfall has never ever gone wrong.

Similarly, after Cyclone Titli had hit the state in October last year, \"banned\" polythene bags had come handy while distributing cooked food among cyclone-affected people. The government had no choice but to use them in the absence of any other alternative during the tragedy. Mostly, food packets in poly bags were distributed in the Purusottampur block in Ganjam. The state government had banned plastic bags with less than 50 microns thickness in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Puri, Rourkela, Sambalpur and Berhampur since October 2, 2018.

The IMA Odisha, which conducted a meeting on Sunday evening, has clarified that they will go ahead with the nation-wide strike call given by its national body. They appealed all the hospitals to withdraw non-essential services like OPD facilities starting from 6 am on Monday to 6 am on Tuesday. Janmejaya Mohapatra, honorary state secretary of IMA Odisha, said emergency services in the hospitals will not be affected due to their strike. He said the Odisha Medical Services Association (OMSA), Odisha Medical Teachers Association (OMTA), Junior Doctors Association, Resident Doctors Association, IMA Students Network and Nursing Home Association have supported the strike. \u201cAttack against doctors in hospitals has become a common thing nowadays, so we want a national-level law for safety and security of the doctors. Hospitals should be declared as safe zone. All associations have extended support for our strike,\u201d said Mohapatra. Keeping the strike in mind, the state government has asked the medical colleges and hospitals to ensure that patient care services should not be affected on Monday. \u201cDoctors have been requested that if they wish to, they may carry out token protests, but they must ensure that patient care services are not affected in any way,\u201d said health secretary Pramod Kumar Meherda. Meherda said the department has taken several steps for safety and security of doctors. Implementation is being reviewed on a regular basis, he added. In a meeting held on Sunday at SCB medical college at Cuttack, the dean and principal of the college decided that if there is a protest by junior doctors, all the routine and emergency works will be managed by the faculties of the concerned departments so that there will be no disruption in the patient care.

The inquiry was launched after a video showing Patnagarh MLA Saroj Kumar Meher forcing the engineer to do sit-ups in public in Bolangir district went viral last week. The district collector had sought a report on the incident. Patnagarh sub-collector had been tasked with probing the incident. \"I have received a report from Patnagarh sub-collector confirming the incident and allegations of manhandling and insult of the junior engineer,\" Bolangir district collector Arindam Dakua said. The district administration will send the report to the state government and recommend action against all those involved in the incident, he said. \"It is for the government to take further steps,\" he added. A case had been registered against Meher at Patnagarh police station on Friday, a day after a complaint was lodged by the wife of the engineer, Jayakant Sabar. Meher was booked under different sections of the Indian Penal Code and the SC/ST Act, a police officer said. \"An investigation is in progress and appropriate steps will be taken in due course,\" he said. The legislator's action had triggered a row, with the opposition BJP targeting the ruling BJD government and demanding Meher's immediate arrest. The Congress also condemned the incident and sought action against the MLA. Meher later apologised for his action and said he was compelled to ask the engineer to do sit-ups to assauge public anger. He claimed that the people in his constituency were angry over poor quality of road construction and \"could have harmed\" the engineer if he did not ask him to do sit-ups. The family members and relatives of the engineer have demanded immediate arrest of Meher and stringent action against him for his \"high-handedness\". Bolangir district Adivasi Manch and Odisha Diploma Engineers' Service Association (ODESA) have also demanded stern action against the legislator. \"The association condemns the act and demands that legal action be taken against him (Meher) immediately,\" a leader of ODESA said. Meher had on June 5 visited the Belpada block in Bolangir, where local people complained about the poor construction of the Mandal-Belpada bypass. In the video clip, the engineer is seen apologising for alleged laxity in performing his duties, but Meher does not relent. The MLA allegedly threatened the engineer with \"mob thrashing\", following which the latter did sit-ups on the road.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Coming under pressure, the state government had selected a land at Gothapatna in Khurda district for the purpose. But nothing has been done so far except selection of the location. The state government had created Rama Devi Women's University at Bhubaneswar, Gangadhar Meher University at Sambalpur and Khallikote Cluster University at Berhampur on May 30, 2015. \u201cThe last two universities have already received land much earlier, but the government is yet to give any official communication to the state\u2019s first women university about finalisation of the land,\u201d said a senior teacher of the university. The government had selected two lands on outskirts of the city, but the university had opposed the selection due to its remote location. On January 30 last year, the higher education department had issued a notification to identify a 30-acre land inside Utkal University for the second campus of the RD University. But students had opposed the government notification and vehemently protested it. Later, the government had dropped the idea to take Utkal land and formed an extended committee on February 19 last year to identify land for the RD University. The committee had submitted its report on March 15 last year regarding the land for the second campus. It has proposed for a land at Gothapatna, but no progress on the issue after that. \u201cThe land at Gothapatna has 78 acres, but there is no clarity about how many acres have been allotted for the university.

Padmaja Mishra, vice chancellor of the university, said she did not get any official communication regarding the allotment of the land for the second campus. \u201cAfter getting land, we will make plan for construction,\u201d she added. The present campus is spread over 22 acres of land near Rupali Square.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion.

BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party.

The cost of using an outdated machine is three times the cost of a new one. With more than 19 lakh SMEs in the state, Odisha becomes one of the top ten states with the highest number of MSMEs in the country. Currently, Odisha is a key focus area of the tech major, said Priyadarshi Mohaprtra, country\u2019s general manager (consumers and devices), Microsoft India. The repair cost of computers (both desktop and laptop) that are over four years old years increases substantially, Mohaptra said, adding that using old PCs increases security threat, reduces productivity and efficiency. Microsoft will create awareness among the SMEs and provide technological support to upgrade their old hardware and software to the latest version as a part of its \u2018Make the Shift\u2019 campaign. The SMEs in Odisha are spending nearly Rs 93,500 in the maintenance of each PC that are over four years old, a study conducted by Microsoft in 21 cities across India had revealed. The study had said the cost was enough to replace the outdated devices with three or more modern PCs. Over 30 per cent SMEs have been using PCs more than four years old. \u201cMicrosoft has been constantly working with the PC manufacturers to introduce Windows 10 powered PCs that empower SMEs to address their key business needs and enable them to use the latest technology in their business applications,\u201d Mohapatra said. He suggested all SMEs to update or switch over to Windows 10 from Windows 7. The support base of Windows 7 operating system will end on January 14, 2020. Mohapatra further said people generally don\u2019t change their PCs due to lack of awareness about security threats and its adverse impact on the productivity, inertia and fear of extra expenditure. We found in the last 12 months that around 43 per cent of old PC users did not know that their devices were virus-affected. Only 12 per cent from them had reported the attack, he added.

New technologies and marketing conditions have emerged in the past few years. In view of this, a new updated policy is being worked out,\u201d said agriculture secretary Saurabh Garg. The agriculture secretary said allied departments have been asked to suggest their views within two weeks following which the final draft policy will be prepared. Sources said chief secretary AP Padhi, at a meeting, directed increasing farmers income through appropriate production, marketing strategies and creating the right ecosystem for flourishing of farmer producer groups and mobilising private investment. With Odisha facing natural calamity almost every year causing widespread damage to standing crops, the updated policy is likely to focus on developing calamity-resilient seeds and agricultural practices. Increasing private sector investment in agriculture and allied sectors may also be part of the new policy. Recently, the state government organised a conclave to attract private sector investment in agriculture and allied sectors. Sources in the agriculture department said diversification of crops, value addition to products, market linkages, increasing horticultural and livestock productions are some of the key areas on which the new policy will focus. The draft policy is being worked out in consultation with experts, universities, civil society bodies and farmers\u2019 groups. The policy will recommend sector-wise interventions to overcome difficulties faced in the last few years and maximising outcomes. The 2013 policy was aimed to bring a shift from subsistence agriculture to a profitable commercial agriculture, promote sustainable agricultural development, increase productivity of important crops by enhancing seed replacement and technology intervention. Odisha government rolls out a separate agriculture budget every year. In 2018-19, public sector investment in agriculture touched Rs 17,000 crore. Around 41.16% of the state\u2019s total geographical area of 155.711 lakh hectares is under cultivation. It is around 61.5 lakh hectares.

It shared power with the Naveen Patnaik-led BJD from 2000 to 2009. The BJP finished as the third largest party in the state after the assembly polls in 2009 and 2014 conceding the space of principal opposition to the Congress.

The two are likely to discuss enhancing Odisha's footprint in the steel sector besides the progress of the proposed petroleum, chemicals and petrochemicals investment region in Paradip, which envisages an investment of Rs one lakh crore in the next few years. It would be the two leaders first formal business meeting after Narendra Modi government came to power at the Centre for a second time and Naveen Patnaik took oath as Odisha chief minister for a fifth term. The BJD termed the upcoming meeting as a natural process in state's interest. \"Odisha being a steel hub, it is natural for the chief minister to meet the Union steel minister to take forward the state's interest,\" said BJD spokesperson Pratap Keshari Deb. In his last visit to the state on June 8, Dharmendra had said the Centre will help to develop the state as a global hub of ancillary industry in the steel sector. While India is the second largest steel-producing nation after China, Odisha is a hub of steel industry in the country. Odisha has around a dozen steel plants, including PSU Rourkela Steel Plant. During his week-long stay in the national capital starting June 9, Naveen has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking 'special focus state' status to states hit with natural disasters besides paying a courtesy call to President Ram Nath Kovind. Naveen is scheduled to return to Odisha on June 15 after attending the Niti Aayog Governing Council meeting. Naveen-Dharmendra meeting is often seen in political prism, Dharmendra being BJP's Odisha face and the saffron party being Naveen's main challenge in the state. After a bitter poll battle, the two sides, however, have shown increasing bonhomie towards each other. A \"chance encounter\" between Naveen and Dharmendra at Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi on April 30 - video clips of which showed the two coming out of the airport and shaking hands-- had given fodder for speculation regarding changing relation between the estranged partners, BJP and BJD.

BJD insiders said Naveen may meet senior party leaders from western Odisha to discuss strategy for Bijepur after returning from New Delhi on Saturday. \u201cPeople of Bijepur have blessed the BJD. The chief minister has assured them that he will personally monitor development works in the constituency. People will bless whoever Naveen decides to nominate for the byelection,\u201d senior BJD leader Kishore Mohanty said. Naveen has already announced a package for the constituency with focus on housing, water supply, irrigation, healthcare, connectivity and infrastructure. Interestingly, people in Bijepur will be voting in an assembly election (including bypoll) for the third time in just over a year. In February last year, Rita Sahu won from the constituency for the BJD in a byelection following the death of her husband Subal Sahu, who had won the seat for three successive terms on a Congress ticket. Rita seems to be the frontrunner for the BJD ticket. She has already started people connect exercises in the constituency. Former Bargarh MP Prabhas Kumar Singh and senior leader Subash Chauhan, who left the BJP to join the BJD ahead of the elections, are also among the contenders. The BJP too has a number of aspirants. Sanat Kumar Gartia, who got 28.91 per cent votes against Naveen in the recent assembly election, seems to be the frontrunner. Names of Ashok Panigrahi, the BJP candidate in the 2018 byelection and senior leader Pradip Purohit, who lost from adjacent Padampur seat, are also doing the rounds. Though the party had done well from the region in the Lok Sabha election, the assembly poll didn\u2019t go as planned, with BJP winning eight of the 35 seats in western Odisha with the BJD bagging 22. Asked about the possible BJP candidate, Gartia said, \u201cIn the BJP, the central leadership takes a call on candidature and cadres work to ensure his/her victory.\u201d The Congress, which polled just 7.75 per cent vote in the recently held assembly election, too has started an exercise to field a suitable candidate.

Asked about Congress' Delhi unit president Sheila Dikshit's remarks that Kejriwal never approached her for an alliance, the chief minister said, \u201cWe have met Rahul Gandhi. Dikshit is not that important leader.\u201d Kejriwal has been urging the Congress to stitch an alliance in Delhi for the Lok Sabha polls to keep the BJP away from power. Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.
