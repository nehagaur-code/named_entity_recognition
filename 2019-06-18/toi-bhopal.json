The Indian women\u2019s compound team \u2014 comprising Muskan, Jyothi Surekha Vennam and Raj Kaur \u2014 came from behind to beat Turkey 229-226. Turkey won the first round 57-55.

We never thought she would make it so big at the international level. She has made us proud,\u201d said Virendra, who owns a grocery shop in Jabalpur. Virendra initially wanted Muskan to become a doctor. \u201cNow, I realize that her decision to become an archer was correct,\u201d said the proud father, Sports minister Jitu Patwari has congratulated Muskan for her medal-winning performance. In April last year, Muskan had represented the Indian team at the World Cup-Stage 1 in Shanghai and the World Cup-Stage 2 in Turkey a month later, where she won the silver medal.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Krishna Batra, 75, was sent to Bhopal after the division of property among his children. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that I came here on my own two years ago,\u201d said Batra, trying hard not to blame his children. \u201cMy children were busy with their own families and I was becoming a burden for them. One day, I boarded a train and got down at Bhopal. A few RPF guys came to me and asked me if I was okay. I told them my story and they brought me here and I haven\u2019t gone home since then,\u201d he said. Shankar Chalisgaonkar, 80, who has three children, lives alone. He was forced to leave after the death of his wife last year. \u201cMy wife passed away last year and circumstances forced me to come here. I was wandering in the streets near Nadira bus stand and as I had no money, I was unable to buy food. After three days, when hunger became unbearable, I requested a local shopkeeper to give me something to eat. I would not have asked him for free food if I had even one rupee with me. He said that he had seen me wandering near the bus-stand and took pity on me. He gave me bread and tea. Then the good fellow called up Apna Ghar and asked them to take me in,\u201d recounted Chalisgaonkar. His children live somewhere in the city itself. Another resident of the old-age home, Prem Narayan Soni, who used to work at a jewellery store, has no one to call his own. After the death of his wife and daughter, he was all alone when the staff at Parul hospital sent him to the old-age home. \u201cAfter the death of my daughter and wife, I tried to work as a labourer at an electronics showroom to transport good to homes pulling carts, but as I was old, that did not last long and I hurt my back. I went to Parul hospital but had no money for treatment or medicines,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the hospital staff asked some volunteers to help me.

The court commuted the death penalty to life sentence, but specified that the accused would remain in jail for 30 years. The court held that the case is based on circumstantial evidence and therefore court has to be more cautious and circumspect while awarding death sentence, besides the accused is only 19 years of age and possibility of his reform and rehabilitation can\u2019t be ruled out and the crime is not a \u2018rarest of rare\u2019 crime. \u201cIt is a case of circumstantial evidence in which the principle of prudence applies. In the cases of circumstantial evidence, while awarding sentence of death penalty clinching cogent evidence ought to be looked into with more care and circumspection in exceptional cases otherwise in a case of circumstantial evidence the death penalty may not be prudent\u201d said Justice J K Maheshwari and Justice Anjuli Palo. They said, \u201cIn the present case, the age of the accused is 19 years and the possibility of reformation and rehabilitation of his entire career cannot be shut down. Simultaneously, it is observed here that nothing has come on record as well as in the finding of the trial court as to why the rehabilitation and reformation of the accused is not possible and such observation of the court is based on the hypothesis and without any basis. As per the report received from jail, the behaviour of the accused is prudent and unquestionable, therefore, in our considered opinion, the policy of reformation and rehabilitation cannot be ruled out in the case of accused who is 19 years of age. The observation made by the trial court while recording the finding that the accused may be dangerous to the society is based on presumption and hypothesis, which cannot be accepted without any basis. In this regard the prior and subsequent antecedents of the accused in the jail are relevant, which do not draw any inference in negative side as observed by the trial court. In view of the foregoing observation and in our considered opinion, the conviction of the appellant-accused recorded by the trial court for charges under section 363, 366-A, 376(2)(f)(i) and 201 of the IPC is hereby affirmed, but on the point of sentence for an offence under 376A read with section 376-AB and 302 of IPC, it is not one of the rarest of rare case in which option of other punishment has been unquestionably foreclosed. Therefore, we commute the death penalty to imprisonment for life.

According to the annual revenue requirement (ARR) of discoms, submitted for the present financial year before the Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC), the loss they occurred is also Rs4098 crores against which discoms have sought a power tariff hike of 12%, which would burden the consumers. If Rs4000 crores that are paid as fixed charges without buying power are anyhow utilized, there would be hardly any need for power tariff hike in state, said sources. Moreover, the discoms in their ARR submitted before MPERC, have informed that a total of Rs8649 crores are paid by discoms every year for their power purchase as fixed charges. Discoms pay it in two parts while purchasing power. Discoms pay to the generators in two ways- one is fixed charge and other is variable charge. Fixed charge is the amount that has to be paid to the generator whether the power was purchased from it or not and variable charges are costs which are only paid as per the quantity of power purchased from the generator. Thus even if no unit of electricity is purchased discoms of MP will have to pay Rs8649 crores as fixed charges, said sources. The official records assessed by TOI showed, the total contracted capacity of power generation of state (total PPAs) was 19,814 Mega Watts in 2018-19. Thus, for this 19,814 MWs discoms are paying the amount of Rs8649 crore as fixed charges. And if the entire capacity is utilized then a total of around 13,870 crore units of power would be produced in an year by 19814MW of capacity, but as per the records in year 2018-19 only around 7400 crore units were supplied by discoms, thus only half of the energy could be used, said sources. Thus of the Rs8649 crores that has to be paid around Rs4000 crores will be against the unutilized 47% of the power which was not purchased, added sources. Of the total fixed charges, Rs2210 are to be paid to private power generators and the remaining are to be paid to either state owned, or to joint ventures or to central government owned generators. State government is however, mulling over legal options to get the PPAs regularized in the state. \u201cWe are taking legal opinion on PPAs that were done,\u201d energy minister Priyavrat Singh said on Friday.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

When the survivor went missing from her house, her family members approached the Ratibad police and lodged a missing person's complaint on May 26. While the cops were searching for the survivor, on Saturday, the accused left her in Bhopal. She then approached the police and lodged a complaint. Acting on the survivor\u2019s complaint, the police registered a rape case and arrested him. Investigating Officer SI Sanjeev Dhakad said the survivor is a BCA second year student and resided with family in a village under Ratibad police station. She stated in her complaint that she came in contact with the accused, Balram, a resident of Khajuri locality, two years ago. As the 32-year-old accused is her relative, he visited her home frequently. SI Sanjeev said, on May 25, the accused somehow won her confidence and took her out of the city. A few days ago, when the survivor started pressuring him to marry her, the accused refused to do so and threatened her with dire consequences.

In the third incident reported at Talaiya police station, a 27-year-old woman was allegedly being raped by a man for seven months on the pretext of marriage.

Investigating Officer SI Lavkush Pandey said the survivor resides with her parents in Jehangirabad. She stated in her complaint that she was married, but got separated a year ago.

MP is also apprehensive that following Gujarat\u2019s decision to store water upto 138 meters in the dam, it may face the issue of submergence as large number of project-affected families are still living in the valley awaiting compensation. According to Narmada Water Dispute Tribunal Award (NWDTA) , MP gets 57% of the power from RBPH. During normal monsoon, Gujarat gets 9 million acre feet (MAF) of Narmada water from the dams of Madhya Pradesh. Now that the two states are ruled by two different political parties, it may compound the problems, political observers said. After getting its full quota of water earlier this year, Gujarat had recently demanded more as it wanted to store water in the dam to a height of 138 meters to test its strength, sources in the state government said. However, Madhya Pradesh reasoned that Gujarat\u2019s decision of storing water at 138 meters would lead to submergence of land in the state where thousands of families have already approached the Grievance Redressal Authority (GRA) regarding compensation. More than 6500 people in the valley in 76 villages may face submergence and this human misery should be avoided, MP stated. After Madhya Pradesh refused to discharge \u201cadditional water\u201d, Gujarat stopped generating power in RBPH, sources claimed. Besides 1200 MW power from RBPH, 200 MW power is also generated from canal power house. Now Gujarat has offered about Rs 250 crore to Madhya Pradesh for the loss of about 700 MW of power, sources claimed. Sources said that after Gujarat\u2019s offer of power compensation, the MP government said it wants the neighbouring state to pay an additional Rs 250 as \u201copportunity cost\u201d as it will have to purchase costly power from the market\u201d. Though the two issues are yet to be resolved, Gujarat continues to store water in the dam, while MP is against discharge of any additional water. Now, Gujarat is banking on heavy monsoon rains in the Narmada valley for MP to release water from its dams after flooding. Minister for NVDA Surendra Singh Baghel said, \u201cGujarat wants to create a crisis in MP. But we will ensure that all rights of Madhya Pradesh are safeguarded. All the rights of the people in the Narmada valley, including those of farmers, will be protected.\u201d Meanwhile, Medha Patkar of Narmada Bachchao Andolan (NBA) said, \u201cThere are more than 30,000 people still living in the valley. The GRA has not been able to figure out how many are living presently in the valley.\u201d She said that the state should seek Rs 3600 crore from Gujarat for refusing to give power from RBPH.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

However this only leads to .06% of the tripping. Actual problem is that mainteance has not been done properly over the past few years. Now, we have made a committee for every discom, which would specifically look into the fact that which component was damaged in which section or circle, for example if insulator of a particular place is burning ten times then there is some problem with the insulator that was supplied, so far there was no such mechanism to look into it.

He said in the so-called first phase, farmers got benefit up to Rs 15,000 only on their total loan amount. \"Congress has not only fooled the farmers, is also trying to cheat them in the name of PM Kisan Nidhi Yojana. The government is not submitting the complete list of farmers to the Centre for financial assistance of Rs 6,000 per annum under the scheme. So far, only 43,000 beneficiaries have been listed against 80 lakh farmers registered with the state government-run cooperatives and mandis\", said Mishra. Taking a jibe at \u2018half-year celebrations' of the government, Mishra said that it is for the first time in the country that any government is celebrating `half-year' of its rule. \u201cIs the Congress government not sure completing one-year term in the state?\" asked Mishra. He said all promises made by the government and listed in the report card presented before the press on Monday are unfulfilled even after six months of being in power. For every single crisis, they blame the opposition party and now they are celebrating their so-called success, he said. \"For power cut, they blamed BJP, for water crisis and crimes, they pointed finger at the BJP. For scams in cooperatives, rape and murder of minors, doctors' strike and what not. They blame BJP for everything. Who is stopping them from taking action against culprits?\u201d said Mishra. He said, \u201cIn six months, the government has failed to fulfil a single promise. After cheating farmers in the name of loan waiver, the party has not provided stipend to unemployed youths. The promise to provide scooter to students is still unfulfilled. People are facing acute water and power crisis, now employees were suffering due to mass transfers\".

A hotel owner just needs to pay online fees and would get bar licence within a set time-frame. The excise department is already in talks with government agencies to get a portal ready wherein the bar licence seekers can apply. Minister for commercial taxes Brajendra Singh Rathore confirmed it and said plan would start taking shape in a month. Objective behind the move is cut short the time exhausted in procedural delays and to earn revenue. System is expected to get in going by the time new policy is in place, minister added. However, after simplifying the process government mulls to increase the fees for issuing bar licences. As of now, bar licence fees is Rs 13.75 lakh for restaurants and over Rs 18.15 lakh for hotels, which would go up once the online time limit bar licence issuing process is in place. Officials said bar licence seekers do not mind paying fees, but they request to issue the licence as soon as possible. As per current procedure, a person has to apply in district excise office for getting licence. The team conducts inspection and report goes to collector from where it is forwarded to excise commissioner and finally minister issues the licence. However, on the pretext of queries, the department hangs the process for months. In the new arrangement, time-limit for inspection would be fixed and all queries would be raised in one go to issue the licence. In the prevalent system, babus issue single query at a time to delay the matter as long as possible leaving the room for corruption. In the new system, an applicant can deem to get the bar licence even if the licence is not issued after the deadline is over. MP would not be the first state to adopt the online procedure. The system is already in place in few states, including Maharashtra where even liquor stock available in a bar can be monitored on day to day basis, officials added. The decision to start the process of easing the process was taken at a high level meeting chaired by chief minister recently. Officials said the incumbent government wants to make the other procedures too in excise department like auction of liquor contracts online. Government is also in process to remove the mandatory purchase of liquor for bars from shops within its vicinity, with an aim to get more variety for tipplers at competitive prices.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Navya Naveli Nanda": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/amitabh-bachchans-granddaughter-navya-naveli-nanda-works-out-on-a-busy-new-york-street-video-goes-viral/videoshow/69835936.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Parents asleep, three-year-old girl drowns in a bucket in Bhopal": {"description": "BHOPAL: A 3-year-old girl drowned in a bucket at her home while her parents were asleep on Saturday in Misrod area of Bhopal.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

And the state Congress, which is running a government with 114 party MLAs (two seats short of absolute majority) with the support of independents and SP-BSP, is eyeing this one tribal reserved seat with great expectations. Jhabua win can take Congress and Kamal Nath government one more step closer to majority at 115, which would be just one seat short of the magic number 116 in a House of 230. Also, a victory in Jhabua bypoll would ensure that BJP suffers a setback and its number reduces from the 109 seats it won in November assembly elections to 108. Increase in Congress\u2019s numbers by even one seat can ensure Kamal Nath government stability as independents breaking away and others would still not give the BJP the required numbers to form the government here. But the Congress\u2019s main hindrance for Jhabua is its own factional feud between former Union minister and party\u2019s tribal leader Kantilal Bhuria and former MLA from the same seat Jevier Medha. Retired government engineer GS Damor won his debut election venture last November when as the BJP candidate he had defeated Kantilal Bhuria\u2019s son Dr Vikrant Bhuria. While Damor secured 66,598 votes and Vikrant Bhuria got 56,161 votes, independent candidate Medha pulled off 35,943 votes. Just days before the elections, Medha was expelled by Congress for fielding himself as an independent candidate. He was annoyed as the party denied him a ticket from the seat. In 2008, Medha - the then Congress candidate - became an MLA after defeating BJP\u2019s Pavesingh Pargi from the same seat by 19,000 votes. But in 2013, Medha lost to BJP\u2019s Shantilal Bilwal by a margin of 16,000 votes. Because he lost to Bilwal, Congress denied him ticket in 2018 and when the party fielded Dr Vikrant Bhuria, Medha became the rebel who had to be ousted for indiscipline. Congress losing Jhabua with Medha securing 35,943 seats became a headache for five-time MP from Ratlam Lok Sabha seat Kantilal Bhuria before the Parliamentary elections. Jhabua is one of the eight assembly constituencies in Ratlam Lok Sabha seat. Realising that Medha was a rival he could not ignore, Kantilal Bhuria had his Congress membership reinstated. Bhuria contested Lok Sabha elections from Ratlam but lost to Damor, who after his assembly election victory, was fielded by BJP for Lok Sabha polls from Ratlam. State BJP president Rakesh Singh confirmed that Damor will retain his Lok Sabha seat and thereafter, he resigned from the assembly. As both the parties get ready for battlefield Jhabua, Congress has two prospective candidates for the bypoll \u2013 former MP and Union minister Kantilal Bhuria or former MLA Jevier Medha. The dilemma is whom to field \u2013 Bhuria, whose son Vikrant lost in November and he also faced a defeat in Lok Sabha or Jevier Medha, the rebel.

However, I wanted to work for the gatemen who perform their duty in interior parts in challenging situations.\u201d He added that the objective behind developing such model crossing was to improve conditions at the crossing along with amenities for the gatemen. At the model railway crossings, RO water machines, separate cabin for gateman, solar panels, hand-pump and plantation have been done. \u201cBesides, a toolkit is provided at all these railway crossings.

Sanganna\u2019s candidature was withheld as the BJP is waiting for the JD(S)-Congress coalition to name its candidate. With the possibility of former chief minister Siddaramaiah contesting, the BJP will require a stronger candidate.
