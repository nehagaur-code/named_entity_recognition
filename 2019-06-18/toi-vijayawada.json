At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "NEET results: 85% clear cut-off": {"description": "VIJAYAWADA: Health minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas (Alla Nani) who took charge on Monday, officially released the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) results for the state.

According to unofficial reports, at least 24 villages in Yerragondapalem, Kanigiri, Giddalur and Markapuram constituencies have been deserted. This is the fourth consecutive year that Prakasam district is witnessing a severe drought. The rural water supply department (RWS), transporting water to the crisis-hit villages, has been struggling to meet the ever-increasing demand for water. Prakasam district singularly is taking up nearly 10,000 trips of water tanks each day of the 22,000 trips being supplied by the water supply department for the entire state. Sources said that RWS officials supplied over 7,500 trips per day to the area in April and upped the scale of supplies to 9,400 by May. They thought that the situation might ease down by June. However, it was not to be. The attempts of the RWS to revive the borewells have also gone in vain as water could not be tapped even at the depth of 1,000ft. Sources in the RWS say that they would not be able to continue the supply by tankers for long. \u201cIn fact, it has become very difficult to supply 1,000 trips per day to each assembly constituency,\u201d said a senior RWS official. \u201cLeaving the village is the only way to survive now,\u201d said Pedda Venkateswarlu of Karumanupalle village of Tarlubadu mandal.

There is no dearth of funds when it comes to development work in the country. \"In the last five years, the government has been able to build homes for eight lakh families, light up 3,000 houses and provide gas connections to 40 lakh homes,\" Modi stated.

Sunkara Chandrasekhar, 44, his wife Lavanya, 41, and their two sons aged 15 and 10, were shot and killed, a police statement said. The family was originally from Tsundur town in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s Guntur district and were living in the US for at least the past two decades. On Saturday at around 10 am, a local resident contacted the emergency number 911 after being informed about gun shots being heard in Chandrasekhar\u2019s house. Police officials, who rushed to the spot, found the four lying dead with gunshot wounds. Sources close to the family said that they had moved into the house only in March. Speaking to TOI, a family friend who is also a member of Telugu Association of North America (TANA) said on condition of anonymity that Chandrasekhar has been suffering from depression for a while and that there might have been a dispute in the family. In an Instagram post, local police explained that at the time of the shooting, other family members, including two adults and two children, were living in the house as guests. After discovering the bodies, one of them rushed out looking for help. He found someone who then called up 911. The police have not revealed the identity of the guests. Although the police have not given any details about the motive behind the shooting, they have stated that there is no immediate threat to the community and that the deaths directly affect their family friends and co-workers. They have also said that investigations had revealed that at the time of the gun being fired, no outsider had entered the house. This is being interpreted by many that a family dispute may be behind the deaths. Chandrasekhar worked for the Iowa department of public safety\u2019s technology services bureau. Sources added that Lavanya too was a software developer. Friends and acquaintances cited his work excellence certificates claiming that he was hard working employee. TANA members got in touch with family members in Tsundur town and were told that everyone was in a state of shock. They also rejected any help saying that they did not want any attention.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The agriculture department has not carried out mandatory inspections in processing units despite knowing that many plants are flouting the norms. Sources said the department is turning a blind eye to unethical operations of seed processing units, seed manufacturing units and fake pesticide firms. As per rules, the processing units should collect seed only from recognized seed research and testing laboratories. The seed readied by scientists should carry a lot number, scientist name and seed variety. The processing centre should maintain records with all details before handing them over to farmers. The unit should have details of the farmer so that the agriculture department carries out germination tests in the field. The seed will be allowed to market only after successful completion of germination test. Many processing units do not procure breeders and set up in the unit, which is mandatory to run the operations. With no official visiting the plants, processing units are marketing unauthorized and untested seeds.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

An increase in the number of industries on the outskirts of the city and unscientific treatment of industrial waste at Jawahar Autonagar and other industrial estates are major factors for the high levels of particulate matter-10 (PM-10) in the city. The Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB), which carried out a study on the reasons behind high PM-10 levels found that furnaces and industries using coal and petroleum coke (\u2018petcoke\u2019) as fuel were causing severe damage to air quality. Jawahar Autonagar is the largest industrial estate in Andhra Pradesh, comprising over 6,000 industries, mainly in the automotive and steel molding sectors, which depend on petcoke and coal as fuel for the furnaces. The estate employs around 2.5 lakh people, who work in these polluted and unhygienic conditions. There is no proper coordination between Jawahar Autonagar and the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) when it comes to handling solid waste, with workers alleging that staff of the Industrial Area Local Authority (IALA) can be seen burning toxic industrial waste. \u201cThere is no door-to-door garbage collection in Autonagar. Authorities of the IALA are ignoring public health. The VMC imposes penalties for burning solid waste, while IALA workers burn hazardous industrial waste daily,\u201d said Bandi Samuel Raj, who runs a tyre retreading company. Meanwhile, severe respiratory disorders have become common in Jawahar Autonagar but the IALA has no action plan yet to handle this. \u201cThe chairman and commissioner of IALA are not bothered about the pollution. The main road connecting Autonagar with Ramavarappadu has become a hub for burning industrial waste. Fumes emitted by burning garbage cause bronchitis and other allergies among residents. Residents of Kanuru, Sanath Nagar and Currency Nagar have been affected due to air pollution from Auto Nagar,\u201d said KMV Rama Rao, who leads a trade union in the estate. Pulmonologists warn that inhaling toxic fumes will severely damage one\u2019s health. \u201cThe smell of rotten eggs is quite common in Autonagar, which is nothing but burning sulphur. Inhaling these fumes will cause respiratory problems in the long run and may increase the chance of cancers and heart diseases,\u201d said Dr BV Mohana Rao, a pulmonologist. APPCB has said it is preparing long-term as well as short-term plans to handle air pollution. \u201cWe are preparing and implementing local area action plan for pollution hotspots and enforcement of air pollution control measures in all industries, including in unauthorised areas. We will use continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) data for enforcement and legal compliance monitoring,\u201d said BSS Prasad, APPCB chairman.

Stating that farmers\u2019 welfare is the highest priority for the government, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has directed officials to work out modalities and make foolproof arrangements to provide nine hours of free power daily for agriculture sector during day time. According to energy minister B Srinivasa Reddy, power utilities are preparing modalities to begin the prestigious scheme. The state has 18.15 lakh pumpsets and 6,663 agriculture feeders. Of them, 4,951 feeders are ready for the nine-hour scheme. Keeping in view Tuesday\u2019s meeting on the modalities of the nine-hour supply, the minister held a teleconference on Sunday. The state has proposed tariffs at Rs 1.50 a unit for aqua farmers, free power to SC, ST colonies up to 200 units a month, and Rs 12,500 to each farmer towards input cost. He said several states had followed the system introduced by former chief minister YS Rajasekhar Reddy. The scheme had been diluted later. Now, Jaganmohan Reddy wants to strictly implement the free power scheme and stop crop losses due to interruptions in power supply to borewells. The CM will directly contact farmers in future to know the ground reality on the nine-hour power supply\u201d Srinivasa Reddy said. After the review of the power sector on Tuesday, a report will be submitted to the chief minister. Energy secretary and Transco chairman and managing director N Srikant said of the 6,663 agricultural 11 KV feeders in rural areas, only 1,712 feeders require some additional infrastructure to begin the nine-hour power supply during day time. Erection of 16 extra high-tension substations, 32 capacitor banks, 52 power transformers and 112 km of extra high voltage lines 220 KV should be completed to make these feeders ready. These balance 26% agriculture feeders will also be given nine hours supply in two spells (five hours during day time and four hours in night) until they are ready with full infrastructure. When officials informed about the pending loan amount of Rs 3,700 crore approved by the World Bank to improve infrastructure under Power for All scheme, the minister told them the matter would be brought to the notice of the chief minister.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The state government has announced that monetary benefit under Ammavodi will be extended to all parents who were sending their children to school whether it is a private or a government school.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

According to the judgement of the consumer forum last year, plastic bags can be sold only if they are not branded. The local municipal body was empowered to implement the order. The body was given the authority to impose fines ranging from Rs 9,000 to Rs 18,000. \u201cRecently, one of the Decathelon showrooms in Hyderabad was fined for selling branded carry bags.

Shekhawat further said that consumers blindly shell out money for carry bags exhibiting the brand name, without the awareness that the brand logo entitles them to get it for free. Many major retailers continue to violate the law as they would rather be fined once than lose a major source of income from customers.

Sunkara Chandrasekhar (44), his wife Lavanya (41) and their two sons aged 15 and 10, were shot and killed, a police statement said. The family was originally from Tsundur in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s Guntur district and were living in the US for at least the past two decades. On Saturday at around 10 am, a local resident contacted the emergency number 911 after being informed about gun shots being heard in Chandrasekhar\u2019s house. Police officials, who rushed to the spot, found the four lying dead with gunshot wounds. Sources close to the family said that they had moved into the house only in March. A family friend, who is also a member of Telugu Association of North America (TANA), told TOI on condition of anonymity that Chandrasekhar has been suffering from depression for a while and that there might have been a dispute in the family. In an Instagram post, local police explained that at the time of the shooting other family members, including two adults and two children, were living in the house as guests. After discovering the bodies, one of them rushed out looking for help. He found someone who then called up 911. The police have not revealed the identity of the guests. Although the police have not given any details about the motive behind the shooting, they have stated that there is no immediate threat to the community and that the deaths directly affect their family friends and co-workers. They have also said that investigations had revealed that at the time of the gun being fired, no outsider had entered the house. This is being interpreted by many that a family dispute may be behind the deaths. Chandrasekhar worked for the Iowa department of public safety\u2019s technology services bureau. Sources added that Lavanya too was a software developer. Friends and acquaintances cited his work excellence certificates claiming that he was a hardworking employee.

As the government is considering to increase liquor prices to make it unaffordable, margin on liquor sales is likely to be increased compensating the corresponding losses in volumes, according to reliable sources in the excise department. The state government is earning nearly Rs 7,000 crore revenue on liquor sales with an average 16 per cent year-on-year growth. There are about 4,402 wine shops and 826 bars across the state which do retail liquor sales. On the other hand, each wine shop is having eight to 10 belt shops which do illegal sales of liquor especially in rural and sub-urban areas. Now with the new government taking the decision to eradicate all belt shops and also to downsize the number of liquor outlets, the sales volumes are likely to get affected. However, this reduction in number of shops may not affect revenues in the first year, said a senior official on condition of anonymity. As the liquor policy is likely to be tweaked every year to downsize the number of outlets to impose complete liquor ban in next five years, revenues will come down from the second year. The increase in liquor prices, however, will give a one-year window for the government to compensate revenue loss and look for alternative sources. On the other hand, many liquor shop owners are also looking to come out of the trade as the state government\u2019s decision is not favourable to them as they expect tighter norms in the upcoming policy.

According to the scheme, the state government has assured to grant Rs 12,500 to each farmer in the state ahead of the Rabi season in October. Sources said that the chief minister has already directed the agriculture department to include tenant farmers under the scheme. Meanwhile, in order to implement the scheme the state government has already scrapped the Chandrababu Naidu government\u2019s Annadata Sukhibhava scheme, which promised to grant Rs 9,000 per year to small and marginal farmers. As per official data, about 60.5 lakh farmers have been identified in the state who own land and there are another 7.5 lakh tenant farmers. Hence, the department has estimated that financial assistance will have to be extended to nearly 68 lakh farmers, for which it will need Rs 8,500 crore. Apart from this the government has promised to pay, on behalf of the farmers, the interest on a loan of Rs 1 lakh. The department has demanded a Rs 4,000 crore for the interest free loans scheme.

The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

The minister pointed out that it was not proper on the part of traders to be reluctant in picking up stocks in peak season. \u201cYou might be having problems in offering high prices due to poor export orders. However, you should not undermine the unrest among farmers as it would permanently hit the trade,\u201d Kannababu advised. He asked the tobacco industry to take small losses in their stride if needed to provide remunerative prices to the growers, particularly those who grow low-grade varieties. He insisted that the prices should not go down further from the prevailing Rs 85 per kg. Former MP Yalamanchili Sivaji said that traders have deliberately slowed down purchases only to offer low prices. He said that growers could not survive unless they were paid at least Rs 120 per kg for the low grades. Farmers alleged that big players were exerting pressure on small merchants to abstain from the market and this was the reason why prices were getting low. ITC CEO Sanji Rangrass said that the stocks being brought by the farmers in the SLS (southern light soil) region were of very low quality and increasing prices could be a tough ask. Indian Tobacco Association (ITA) president Mittapalli Umaamaheswara Rao, on his part, said that there was no demand for low grade varieties in the export market and offering more than Rs 80 per kg was unviable for them.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party.

Under Modi\u2019s regime, more number of farmers committed suicide and unemployment increased.\u201d She added that Modi failed to explain the Pulawama incident and the Rafale deal and spurned the demand for an all-party meeting on the issues. \u201cThe nation does not want leaders like Narendra Modi and Amit Shah,\u201d she asserted, and challenged Modi for an open debate on a national channel of his choice to discuss issues facing the country.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

The patient, Babu, had high fever and was admitted to the hospital\u2019s general ward a couple of days ago. His condition worsened on Saturday, his relatives said, alleging that he died as he could not be shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for want of stretcher. They said they searched for a stretcher for 30 minutes but could not find one in the hospital. Finally, it was the attendant of another patient who managed to get a stretcher. But by the time Babu was shifted to the emergency ward, his condition had worsened. He developed convulsions and died before doctors could start treatment. The bereaved relatives entered into a heated argument with the hospital staff and staged a demonstration. They later took the body home to complete funeral rites. Hospital officials were unavailable for comment. But sources confirmed lack of proper infrastructure led to the patient\u2019s death.

The opposition party alleged that the governor\u2019s speech did not include key topics such as Amaravati development, Polavaram Project and industrial policy. Both Houses of the legislature have begun the debate on the motion thanking governor ESL Narasimhan for his address on June 14. In the assembly, government whip Budi Mutyala Naidu moved the motion, seconded by Kakani Govardhan Reddy. They said the government headed by Y S Jaganmohan Reddy is giving priority to neglected sections and farmers. They accused the TDP government of indulging in heavy corruption in Polavaram Project and Pattiseema lift irrigation scheme. TDP leader K Atchannaidu found fault with the governor not acknowledging development in the last five years. He questioned the government for not making any mention of Amaravati and Polavaram Project. He welcomed the ruling party\u2019s decision to order probe into irrigation projects and asked them to prove the charges. He dared them to stop Pattiseema scheme, if YSRC found it useless as some members claimed. \u201cIf you think Pattiseema is a wasteful project, I would advise you to stop pumping water from the scheme for this season and see what the farmers would say,\u201d Atchannaidu said. He found fault with the government handing over some buildings of AP to Telangana, without settling the institutions listed in Schedule IX and X of the AP Reorganisation Act. He also wanted the government to check with the energy department and ensure there are no power cuts in the state. Finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy blamed the TDP government for not getting funds from the central government or get Schedule IX and X institutions bifurcated in the last four years when the TDP was in alliance with BJP. On developmental issues, the minister said the TDP government had utilised the spillover funds from the 13th finance commission, full funds from the 14th finance commission and funds from MNREGS. \u201cWhatever was spent from these funds had gone mostly to Janma Bhoomi committees ignoring the elected gram panchayat sarpanches and ward members,\u201d the minister said.
