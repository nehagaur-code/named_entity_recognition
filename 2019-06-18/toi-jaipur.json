Jaipur may not be the ideal city for upcoming rock bands to set base, but Joshua is of the opinion that the situation isn\u2019t that bad either. \u201cI have seen a lot of rock bands that have mushroomed in the last couple of years in Jaipur.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Rajasthan Royals 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rajasthan-royals-team-2019-players-list-rr-team-2019/articleshow/67151472.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Many courses in Rajasthan University fail to get even 10 applications": {"description": "JAIPUR: There seem to be only few takers for certain certificate courses at Rajasthan University (RU) for which less than 10 admission forms have been received.

H R Khan, head of the department of Urdu and Persian at RU, talks about the problems that his department is facing. \u201cWe have six teachers in our department but two faculty will retire within two months. We are in urgent need of 18 teachers. Students will take interest if there is good faculty. In certificate courses, we are barely managing to fill 20 seats in Urdu and Persian due to lack of faculty. We had to stop MPhil, honours and certificate diploma courses due to shortage of faculty. The future of both these courses is very bleak in our university,\u201d said Khan. RU provides bachelor\u2019s degree in courses like painting, applied art and sculpture for four years. These courses come under visual arts department. Although there is no required 10+2 stream or entrance test for these courses, still they face the challenge of filling seats. Professor T J Kavoor, assistant professor in-charge of the sculpture department in RU says that 70% of their course is practical and 30% theoretical. \u201cWe do not have any teacher for theoretical subjects. In the department of visual arts, we need at least 16 teachers but have only four. We have asked the RU administration many times last year when the recruitment process was going on for more faculty but they do not take our subjects very seriously. Our teachers went to meet the governor as well. When our students apply in other universities for higher education, they are rejected in interviews due to lack of theoretical knowledge.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

So, the only way to find the Jewish cemetery in the city is to ask for the Christian graveyard. \u201cNo one from the community exists anymore. Once the population of Jews was around 150-200. But most of them migrated to Israel or other parts of India seeking better opportunities,\u201d says Ratan Bennett holding onto the rusted gate of the Jewish cemetery with a \u2018Star of David\u2019 on it. Ratan Bennett (70) is the only person in the city with a Jewish heritage. Born as Abbey Gail Jared in Abu city, she was a Jew before converting to Christianity after her marriage. With only eight graves, the Jewish cemetery has no boundary wall. The land surrounding the cemetery is full of wild plants and thorny bushes. The epitaphs are in Hebrew and English and only state the name and date of death of the person. The oldest grave dates back to 1904. \u201cAbu Road was one of the biggest railway junctions in the British era. Jews, have always been an educated community who settled here to work in the railways. Earlier, the boundaries of this cemetery were intact. Some graves used to have beautiful statues of a woman reading from the Torah (Jewish religious scripture) but slowly due to encroachment and neglect it is now in a dilapidated condition. Around 40 years back, my uncle was the last Jew in the city who migrated to Israel,\u201d recalled Ratan. Ratan\u2019s maternal grandfather who was a guard in railways is buried at the Abu Road cemetery and her paternal grandfather is buried at another Jewish cemetery in Ajmer. These are the only two places to have Jewish cemeteries in Rajasthan. Like on Abu Road, Jews settled in Ajmer were also in the railways. Once a flourishing community, now there are no more Jews left in Rajasthan. As per the 2001 census, one Jew was recorded to be living but no one knows his whereabouts. Migration towards Israel started after its formation in 1948. As per Hansey Timoty (42), a Christian, who is the fourth generation of his family taking care of the Jewish cemetery in Ajmer, the last person buried there was in 1962. \u201cThis is the grave of a six-year-old girl who died in an accident. Her father was in railways before migrating to Israel in 1965. Since then, some of her relatives and others have come to pay a visit once in a while. Otherwise, even the municipal authorities of Ajmer have no clue about this place,\u201d said Hansey. Like Abu Road, Ajmer Jewish cemetery is bordering with the CNI Church Christian Graveyard at Christian Ganj. Built around the same time as Abu Road cemetery, the Ajmer Jewish cemetery has 46 graves and is in shambles with no one to look after it. At its peak, Jews were 250\u2013300 in number before migrating to Israel. At present, both the cemeteries are looked after by the Jewish community settled in Ahmedabad. Joint secretary of the Magen Abraham Synagogue (Jewish place of worship) Jacob Robin Srigawkar while talking to TOI expressed concern about the fate of two cemeteries.

In Jaipur last Saturday to perform at the Birla Auditorium, he asked the audience, \u201cWho would have thought ki sabzi ko besan mein daal kar, usko fry kiya jayega? It is boredom which is the mother of all inventions, not necessity.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd marriage is another example of boredom.\u201d These were only a few of the quips directed at the audience by the stand-up comedian during his gig.  From creation of language, evolution of mankind, Valentine\u2019s Day and how he ruined his father\u2019s publishing business to him dealing with depression \u2013 Maheep\u2019s session had an amusing take on all of these. \u201cWe created the definition of success and failure and now we\u2019ve restricted ourselves in our head. It\u2019s important to embrace failure or you will never learn. Failure is inevitable. After experiencing one failure after the other, I turned into a really angry person who felt depressed and dejected. In that state, I could have easily shot anybody who tried to mess with my head. The choice was clear \u2013 to give in to the anger or make people laugh using comedy. I chose the latter,\u201d he said as he addressed a young audience.  Those expecting Rajasthani jokes didn\u2019t get to hear any because Maheep didn\u2019t know any. \u201cI only crack jokes about sardaars because it\u2019s good to laugh at yourself,\u201d he told us, adding, \u201cI enjoy Marwari jokes, but unfortunately I don\u2019t know any. Now I will learn some so that whenever I am in Jaipur next, I can crack some Marwari jokes or those directed at the people of Jaipur,\u201d he added. Talking about what makes for a good stand-up comedian, he said, \u201cA good stand-up comedian acts as a vent for people to channel their everyday frustration. So if you cuss at a politician, people enjoy it because deep down they\u2019re also tired of their country\u2019s political system. Woh gaali dena chahate hain, aur ek stand-up comedian unki feelings ko voice karta hai.\u201d  Having performed in Jaipur many times, Maheep is glad that the city now witnesses several comedy gigs.

The scheme is about having plantation in the city parks where there are no borewells or the borewells have become dry due to which irrigation facility is not available. In these parks around 5,520 trees will be planted which will be maintained by Jaipur Development Authority for the next two years. Senior horticulturist S P Bhadu of JDA while talking to TOI explained, \u201cThis idea was discussed to save as much water as possible because in flowering plants, grass and other gardens hundreds of litres of water is wasted and they need more maintenance. Once the trees are planted they require water only 3-4 times every month. Hence, they will be easily maintained. The entire operations will cost us around Rs 38.92 lakh.\u201d As monsoon is approaching, government will distribute around 21,000 saplings to the residents of the city who would have to take care of the plants later.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The climate change alone is not responsible for desertification Pushkar which is located in the midst of serene Aravalli hills. Human intervention is also to be largely blamed for it.

Open potholes and manholes have also come as a cause for worry as they get blocked with garbage and then over flow. \u201cThe main roads are good as compared to the smaller lanes because the government focuses on them. The smaller lanes always get filled up with muck and water during monsoons and cause difficulties to residents and commuters. We also see a lot of accidents happening on these roads because of water logging,\u201d said Karan Raj Sharma, a resident of Choti Chaupar. And it is not only the damaged roads but also the unattended pits made by workers that create problems for people. Bhagyashree Kalia, a resident of Pratap Nagar, said, \u201cThe drainage system around our locality is not efficient. Even after light showers drains get blocked and water gets collected on the side of the road. These small pools of water harbour mosquitoes and often emit a foul smell over a period of time. Local authorities did repair a few broken roads some time back but many of these roads have returned to their earlier state.\u201d Residents have also time and again complained that the bare electric wires that are hanging loose from electric poles and sometimes also lying on the roads or pavements can cause a major problem during monsoons. These live wires come in contact with water and may electrocute it, making it fatal for the people, animals as well as vehicles passing the area. The month of June is half gone but the work of desilting the drains is still not complete. There are around 827 small drains in the city and about 20 big drains. Though Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) claimed that more than 700 small drains have been desilted but tenders for the remaining bigger drains have not yet been floated. An official at the JMC said that the formalities for the tender have been completed and it will be floated soon. \u201cBecause of the Lok Sabha elections held this year, a moral code of conduct was applied so no tenders were issued and no work could be done. Due to this cleaning of the sewerage and drainage system got delayed. Work which had to be done 2-3 months in advance is being done now. We can only wish that there is not much problem during the monsoon.\u201d a source in JMC told TOI. However, not all areas are in such a dismal condition. Work has been done in certain parts and is being appreciated by the residents. Alisha Varghese, a resident of Gujjar Ki Thadi, said, \u201cThe government is trying to improve water logging conditions. We now have cemented roads that are less prone to damage. They have also made a separate canal for drains. The problem of water logging has also been solved.\u201d Apart from the problems faced by traffic, pedestrians are also at risk because of the water filled roads as manholes are not visible and they may fall into them.

He asked the Centre to immediately release the first instalment of Rs 370 crore for the year for the National Rural Drinking Water Project. Gehlot sought financial aid worth Rs 1,454 crore for Phase 3 of Rajiv Gandhi Lift Canal Project. \u201cThis project is intended to supply drinking water to 2014 villages and five towns of Jodhpur, Barmer and Pali districts up to year 2051. Also, financial aid for the linking of Brahmani river to Bisalpur Dam for drinking water supply for Jaipur, Ajmer, Tonk and Nagaur districts.\u201d The CM demanded that the NITI Aayog should take the responsibility of the special rail projects other than the cost of land acquisition, which should be borne by the states. \u201cOn this basis, Ratlam-Dungarpur via Banswara railway line should be initiated,\u201d he added. He further requested that Dholpur-Sarmathura broad-gauge line should be started soon along with an extension of route upto Gangapur City. The CM also demanded that the Union ministries should remove various procedural hurdles in releasing the funds for the Centrally-sponsored schemes. He further requested for strengthening the federal structure of the country by providing more rights to the states in utilization of funds provided by the Centre. He also apprised the Niti Aayog team that recently, the state government framed a law to provide exemption from any kind of permission for first three years to the MSME units.

The US president removed India from the GSP beneficiary list which has put Indian economists on the job to study its implications. The assessment by economists on this subject will further shape India\u2019s relation with its old time ally. Of late, students have realised the growing importance of this subject which is the reason behind admissions in economics have become tough with each passing year. It is a science with inter-disciplinary approach and goes hand in hand with governments, businesses, societies, households and individuals. In the last two decades, the concepts of economics have been prominently merged in several subjects like public policy, healthcare, diplomacy and law which has made it a highly job oriented course. Governments rely on the views put by the economists to understand and create laws that deal with crime, family, education, health care. Economics, as a subject, is offered by Rajasthan University as masters in economics, MPhil in economics while Maharani\u2019s College and Rajasthan College offer BA (pass course) and BA (honours). Economics, as an optional subject, is also offered at Maharaja\u2019s College and Commerce College. Students are eligible for a master\u2019s degree after completing their graduation. Rameshwar Jat, an associate professor of economics in Rajasthan University said, \u201cEconomics is a technical subject which mainly focuses on market\u2019s demand and supply, it uses rigorous statistical analysis to analyse the changes. It is known as the physics of social sciences. Due to the change in trends the horizon of economics has widened, it now also focuses on the international relations based on the economy of a country. Since then, a concept of political economics has also been discovered. It also develops conceptual models of behaviour to predict responses to changes in policy and market conditions. The study of economics provides valuable knowledge which can also be used in our daily life.\u201d He added, \u201cDue to a boom in the technical field, students are more interested in economics now. It not only covers basic theory but also includes models, data analytics and econometrics which revolve around interpretation and forecasting of data. Students with a liking towards practical subjects should opt for economics.\u201d Economics is an application based subject which keeps a student occupied. It helps students to decipher the information about ongoing economic developments.

Currently, the three-year-old startup that employs over 100 people is managing 50,000 tyres of 55 heavy commercial vehicle fleet owners in eight states offering retreading and refurbishing services to improve their longevity and increase second life. Though founder and CEO of Fleeca India Pvt Ltd Tikam Chand Jain declined to share the fund size it wants to raise citing valuation issues, he said the funds would be ploughed in to expand the Fleeca centres across the country before it goes full throttle on the cost-per-km model. \u201cAfter fuel, tyre is biggest part of the operation cost for commercial vehicles. Through our management, we enhance mileage by 15-20%. If tyres are retreaded at the right time, they can run for more than half the life of the new ones. We have around 50 retreading centres in different cities and want to expand. We are talking to some big ecosystem players and expect the funding to materialise in next two months,\u201d said Jain. Unlike the services it currently offers, Fleeca, through the cost-per-km model,would own the tyres and fleet owners will have to pay as per the distance clocked. \u201cWe have already started a pilot of the model for a company. In this model, tyres are owned by us and the owner of the fleet pays as per the distance clocked. To expand this vertical, which is going to be our core area of operation, we need to have more Fleeca centres on the highways where the tyres will be inspected, repaired and retreaded. Also there would be other facilities for the drivers. We already have 15 such centres but need capital to spread the footprint,\u201d added Jain. Fleeca is currently working on a software with the use of artificial intelligence and internet of things that can predict the condition of tyres in advance. \u201cWe have tied up with IIT-Gandhinagar for developing the sensor-based technology,\u201d added Jain.

We have done a number of private events in Jaipur earlier. The weather is simply amazing during this time of the year. We performed to a lovely crowd of music aficionados (old and young). Our challenge was to make sure that we keep people of all ages entertained and hooked. Thus, we made our set list accordingly. Overall, it was a great experience being in Jaipur,\" he shares. With a chock-a-block schedule, the members of the band did not get enough time to explore Jaipur. Sanam says, \"We reached in the daytime and straightaway headed for the sound check. Then, we got back, worked on our set list, got ready and left for the show. After the show, we did manage to eat some delicious Rajasthani food. The food was little on the spicy side but that did not stop us from gorging on the delectable food served to us. I love Jaipur ka khana.\" Venkat S, the bass guitarist, quips, \"I love laal maans. I think it is something to die for; it\u2019s heaven on the plate.\" Keshav Dhanraj, the drummer says, \"I think we come to Jaipur mostly just to eat. Every time we come here, we are occupied with sound check and our show. So the only thing that we do is to gorge on Jaipur\u2019s food and enjoy the weather.\"  To which Sanam jokingly adds, \"This is so true. We are big-time foodies. Agar humein khaane ke liye paise milte to hum sab kitne rich hote.\" Venkat says that the next time when they come to the city, they would love to move around like any other tourist and see the rich heritage that the city boasts of.  On Friday, the band came up with their new song, Sanam Mennu. Sharing the idea behind the song, Venky S, says that the song has been composed keeping Valentine's Day in mind. He adds, \"It's our first release this year and is our original composition. It's a light-hearted song about something most people go through while in a relationship. Since, we are four boys, the song is obviously from a boy's perspective. This is our Valentine's Day special song and we hope that everyone will relate to the lyrics and tune of this song.\"  (L-R) Venky S, Samar Puri, Sanam Puri and Keshav Dhanraj , members of Sanam bandThe band, Sanam, is known for its renditions of retro classics apart from their original compositions. We ask them if there are any factors that they take into consideration when they choose a retro song. To which Keshav replies that there are no factors as such. However, whichever old classic they decide to revamp, they make sure to not change the soul and melody of the song. \"We grew up listening to some beautifully composed and well-written songs, an art that seems to have lost its way these days. Most of the newer music we hear today lacks the soul and complex compositions that we enjoyed listening to. As a band, we decided to make our own renditions of these amazing songs so that the newer generations can get a chance to listen to some well written and composed creations. Our renditions also connect with the older audiences because they get to hear their favourite songs presented to them in a new light. We give it our own sound and flavour, but the soul of the song remains intact.\"  Opening up on creative differences within the members of the band, vocalist Sanam says, \"Each of us has different musical background and enjoys listening to different styles of music. The fact that we have different ideas and creative processes, helps keep our sound unique. We respect each other\u2019s ideas and make sure that we only release a song once all of us are completely satisfied with it. Also, we work on things together so we are always open to trying different options before settling on anything.\"  Sanam band during their performance Talking about Rajasthani folk music, Keshav shares, \"We find Rajasthani folk music interesting. There are so many unique instruments like the khartal, ravanahatha, alghoza, sarangi etc. that are used. We have a playlist on our Youtube channel only for regional music. So far, we have not attempted a Rajasthani song. But we hope to collaborate with some musicians and singers from Rajasthan to make some interesting renditions of the state's folk music.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh.

A report by Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI) reveals that the spurt in economic activities in the desert districts has shattered the fragile landscape, impacting its residents directly. CAZRI shared the report to mark the World Day to Combat Desertification on June 17. This was compiled using multiple independent studies including the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite data 2015-16. The report made the astonishing claim that 14.88-million-hectare land in 12 western Rajasthan districts suffered from different kinds of land degradation contributing to desertification. The report has studied the features of desertification: wind erosion / deposition, water erosion, salinity/ alkalinity, waterlogging and vegetation degradation to conclude that the situation may take decades to reverse the damage. The report studied districts of Barmer, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Churu, Ganganagar, Hanumangarh, Jodhpur, Jalore, Jhunjhunu, Nagaur, Pali and Sikar. \u201cThe biggest reason contributing to desertification turned out to be water erosion. Our report suggested that 64.69% mapped area is facing wind erosion. For instance, 10% of land degradation in districts like Barmer, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur is due to water erosion,\u201d said O P Yadav, director, CAZRI. Explaining the reason why the sandy landscape existing from millions of years is facing the change only in the last few decades, the report explained that such landscapes are highly vulnerable to wind erosion and it is a universal phenomenon. \u201cWhat made the situation worse is human-induced activities like fast urbanization, deforestation, mining, indiscriminate use of groundwater, rise in livestock population and the hot summers leading to evaporation. This has accelerated desertification,\u201d said Yadav. Supporting their claim, the scientist says that western Rajasthan harbours a total domestic livestock population of nearly 30.18 million heads \u2013 an increase of 14.63 million heads (94.72%) over the 1956 Census figures. \u201cThe destruction of vegetative cover due to overgrazing, felling of trees, etc. have accelerated the removal of sediments from the catchment areas of waterbodies as well as loosening of farm soil,\u201d said Yadav. Large-scale mining has been mapped in Jhunjhunu, Jalore, Jodhpur, Barmer for the minerals and building materials, which has impacted the equilibrium. The vegetation cover has gone forever, making the land vulnerable. The report added that the overall scenario has affected the agricultural productivity to a great extent. The introduction of water intensive and multiple crops have their adverse effects in the region. \u201cThe empirical data is still being collected to give exact mass land converted into desert,\u201d said Yadav. The team of scientists are also accessing the damage being caused due to increasing vehicular traffic, construction of roads and canal and exploration of oil and gas.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Congratulations to him on becoming the working president of the party,\" the Prime Minister added. Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president. Nadda has long experience of the party organisation as he was the in-charge of the party headquarters and is a popular figure.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition.

Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

ICOMOS is a professional association that works for the conservation and protection of cultural heritage around the world.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.
