At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Flouting of Supreme Court order": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/floutingofsupremecourtorder/articleshow/63552509.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "CCTVs, more seats to make your NCR train trip better": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/cctvs-more-seats-to-make-your-ncr-train-trip-better/articleshow/68870912.cms", "time": "2019-04-14 23:31:00", "description": "NEW DELHI: Travelling daily from Delhi to Palwal, Ballabgarh, Ghaziabad, Faridabad will soon get a lot easier for those taking Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) trains.

EMU, DEMU and DMU trains ply daily in NCR and are used by thousands of commuters every morning and evening. RN Singh, divisional railway manager (DRM), Delhi Division, said the concern of women safety has been addressed with these new trains and other features, which are missing in the current fleet, were also looked at. \u201cToilets were initially missing in the EMUs plying in NCR. We had to retrofit them. However, the new trains will have them pre-attached. More seats will also be added along with LED lights,\u201d he said. Railways had recently increased security in local trains; however, the problem of men entering all-women trains persists. Currently, only a few trains running locally have dedicated RPF personnel, also leaving it vulnerable to snatching. \u201cFor a womens\u2019 coach, we could deploy RPF personnel, but for ladies special trains we have been unable to curb the problem effectively as men keep switching coaches. The use of CCTV cameras will bolster security and provide visuals of violators,\u201d Singh added. According to officials, each coach will have 110 seats and a GPS-based navigational system. A total of 323 passenger trains run from the capital to Palwal, Ghaziabad, Mathura and Meerut. These include 109 EMUs, 59 mainline electric multiple units (MEMU), 34 diesel multiple units (DMU) and 121 ordinary passenger ones. A ticket for a 30km journey costs just Rs 10. The maximum one has to pay is Rs 35 for a 165km trip. \u201cThe acceleration and de-acceleration is smoother in these train as was found during testing. The newer features like GPS positioning will also provide real-time updates to us and the passengers,\u201d said a senior railway official said. The trains are likely to be added in a phased-manner in Ghaziabad, Palwal and Faridabad sections. Officials said the new trains are likely to reduce the travel time as they are capable of reaching 110 km/hr. \u201cWe have carried out a few trial runs, and more testing needs to be done before they can be put on tracks.

According to locals, the digging has been going on for a month, to transport groundwater to a farmhouse from illegal borewells previously dug in the village by the farmhouse owner. Villagers said water scarcity on the hills is making many farmhouse owners lay illegal water pipelines from borewells situated in low-lying villages like Kharak to their farmhouses, situated on the hills near Raisina village. \u201cAs there is no source of water up the hills, borewells dug in low-lying areas are used to extract water and pump it to the farmhouses. The construction has been going on in broad daylight, with the authorities least bothered about it. Our village will soon run out of water if such violations continue,\u201d said a villager, requesting anonymity. Activist Colonel (retired) S S Oberoi said, \u201cIllegal walls, illegal farmhouses, illegal felling of trees to clear land and now illegal water pipeline to support these. Laying pipeline alone involves numerous violations, from digging borewells in an area already marked as a \u201cdark zone\u201d for water availability, and laying the pipeline along the road without permits. It\u2019s clear there is no check by authorities in the area.\u201d All this, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ban on extraction of groundwater in 448 sq km of the Aravalis in Gurugram and Faridabad. The area also falls under Aravali Notification, which doesn\u2019t allow construction in the area. Under sections 3(1) and 3(2)(v) of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Rule 5(3)(d) of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, \u2018cutting of trees\u2019 and \u2018construction of any clusters of dwelling units, farmhouses, sheds, community centres, information centres and any other activity connected with such construction (including roads a part of any infrastructure relating thereto)\u2019 is prohibited in areas falling under the notification. In July 2018, a similar violation came to light, but no action was taken against the farmhouse owners. As many go scot free, farmhouses owners are emboldened. Some believe the only way to protect the area is to give \u2018deemed forest\u2019 status to the entire Aravalis. Jitender Bhadana of NGO Save Aravalis, said, \u201cAll forested and hilly areas, including Raisina, are prone to illegal construction and illegal extraction of groundwater, because Aravalli Notification hasn\u2019t given enough legal shield to the Aravalis. Therefore, the only way to end massacre of the Aravalis is to declare the entire range \u2018deemed forest\u2019.\u201d In December 2010, the high court ordered a complete ban on borewells and asked the administration not to give permits for them without consulting the court, after the PWD predicted the city will run out of groundwater by 2040 if the usage continued at the then rate of consumption. The entire Gurugram district was marked as a \u2018dark zone\u2019 by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) in 2013, which refers to an area where groundwater level has fallen beyond a parameter. Officials of the forest and hydrology departments, and HSPCB all assured that the violations will be inspected and strict action taken against offenders.

The metro line between the two cities had been discussed earlier as well, but the project was delayed. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has directed officials to expedite work on the proposed line, which is the fifth such line proposed in Gurugram. The discussion on the metro link between the two cities came up during a review of Haryana\u2019s metro projects in the NCR in a meeting in Chandigarh late last month. Sources said the 31-km metro line is expected to start at Bata Chowk in Faridabad and connect with Huda City Centre. The cost of the project is expected to be around Rs 5,900 crore. The initial plan was to link Bata Chowk to Huda City Centre via Gurugram Sector 54, Sushant Lok and Sector 45. \u201cAs of now, discussions are underway to either merge the metro link with the DMRC Yellow Line at Sikanderpur metro station or with the Rapid Metro line at the Sector 55-56 Rapid Metro station,\u201d a senior GMDA official present at the meeting told TOI. He, however, added that the route is subject to final changes. Another possibility is that it might be extended along the Golf Course Road till Vatika Chowk on Sohna Road. The Faridabad-Gurugram metro link has been in the pipeline for a while now, and already has in-principle approval from the state and central government. This is the fifth metro project proposed in the city after Gurugram metro, Regional Rapid Transit System, Mass Rapid Transport System and the orbital rail along the Kundli-Manesar Expressway. GMDA officials have dismissed concerns regarding these projects, all of which have been delayed, saying these metro loops together would address issues of public transport in the city as they would provide not internal connectivity within Gurugram but also link the city with Delhi, Faridabad, Manesar and Palwal. TOI had recently reported that the Haryana government is considering a link between the Delhi Metro Blue Line and Gurugram metro. The biggest question, however, is of funding. Gurugram and Faridabad metro together require around Rs 12,000 crore. While the state government is expecting financial support from the Centre, it will have to present a long-term plan on the revenue models of both metro lines and on whether they will have sufficient ridership to justify the capital and operational expenses.

The professor, who is on the run, had applied for anticipatory bail before additional sessions judge of Faridabad court, Jagbhushan Gupta. The next date of hearing is scheduled for May 30, but the court has not restrained police from arresting the accused. He could get arrested any time, said police. The scandal was unearthed in the government college last week, when a student filed a police complaint and submitted an audio-visual recording, alleging that three college staffers, including the associate professor, were sexually abusing girls students by promising them better grades in exams. In the recording, the accused lab assistant can be heard asking the girl student to accompany him to a hotel in exchange of better grades. Following this, peon Vikram and lab assistant Jagdev were arrested. During their interrogation, the lab assistant revealed that several girls were promised better grades in practical exams in lieu of sexual favours by senior college staff, including the accused associate professor. On the basis of his statement, a section on rape was added to the FIR. Police has now also added sections of the SC/ST Act to the FIR. The case against the college staff was registered at women\u2019s police station in Sector 16, under section 354 (outraging modesty), 376 (rape), 201 (destroying evidence), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC and Section 18 of the SC/ST Act. It has also come to light that some students may have been threatened by the accused, who even tried to tamper with evidence. Police said they believe many of the victims, traumatised by the sexual exploitation, are yet to come out. The state government has already suspended the accused staff and the college principal. Advocate Sanjeev Chaudhary, counsel for the accused, said there is no direct allegation against associate professor C M Vashist. \u201cThe complainant is a student of science and my client is a professor of commerce,\u201d said Chaudhary. Countering his argument, the complainant\u2019s counsel O P Sharma said the issue is not related to one particular student, but was about the trust of thousands of parents who send their children to the college. \u201cThe evidence that has come to light suggests involvement of an organised racket in the exploitation of girl students,\u201d said Sharma, adding that the accused professor needs to be arrested to extract more details of the case. \u201cWe\u2019re probing the case and trying to arrest the third accused,\u201d said a senior cop in Faridabad.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught.

However, encroachers continue to fell trees,\u201d said a villager. An official in the forest department said action couldn\u2019t be taken now as they had not received any complaint. \u201cSo far, we are not aware about any attempts made in the area to fell the trees. However, we had tried our best to stop encroachment in the area,\u201d he said. Non-forest activity is not allowed in the area which is notified under PLPA, 1900. Moreover, the land in Mangar Bani is protected as it has been demarcated as a 677-acre forest area with 500-metre buffer zone (no-construction zone). Mangar Bani is the only sacred forest grove left in Delhi-NCR. It\u2019s located on the tail end of the Aravalis, the oldest mountain ranges of the country, and is close to the Gurugram-Faridabad highway.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath. The Pro tem speaker ruled that the members stick to the format provided. After this, the members of BJP started adding 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' after end of every oath. Some of the prominent names who took oath from Madhya Pradesh included K P Yadav who defeated Jyotiraditya Scindia, Rakesh Singh, Ramakant Bhargava and Nakul Nath.

Shockingly, five wild animals \u2014 including a leopard, two jackals, an Indian fox and an Indian hare \u2014 have been killed in road accidents in the first three months of the year. Besides, the Pali road that transects the Gurugram-Faridabad road in Faridabad, and the Surajkund-Badkal road bisecting the Pali road, have also reported cases of roadkill. Developed as a state highway some 12 years ago, and winding its way through the fauna-rich Aravalis, this stretch embodies the conflict between man and animal. And chief among the reasons behind the large number of deaths is that each of the three roads bifurcate the natural wildlife corridor between Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary in Delhi and Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar, Rajasthan. This bifurcation has ended up fragmenting habitats by altering the local topography, adversely affecting the entire ecology of the area. Worse, little effort has gone into ensuring the safety and protection of the many species of wildlife in the region. When TOI visited the three roads, it found hardly any speed-breakers, even near sensitive zones like Mangar Bani and Asola Bhatti. On a 4km stretch on the Gurugram-Faridabad road, between the check-post in Mangar village and Pali road, there is just one speed-breaker, while the Pali (8.4km) and Surajkund-Badkal (7.8km, till the shooting range in Faridabad) roads have only four speed-breakers. Lamentably, there is not a single signboard indicating the presence of wild animals on the three stretches. \u201cLast month, we reported the death of a fox and an Indian hare on the Surajkund road. In January, a female leopard was run over by a heavy vehicle on the Gurugram-Faridabad road. These are the cases that get reported. However, the fact is that wild animals die every day on these roads and several cases go unreported. Sadly, the authorities don\u2019t even lift the carcasses, except in the case of leopards\u2019 deaths,\u201d says Sanjay Rao, a wildlife activist from environmental NGO Save Aravali. \u201cThe authorities don\u2019t want to make any security arrangements for wildlife as they don\u2019t want to highlight the presence of wildlife here. The ignorance, however, has led to a rise in the cases of roadkill and thus the destruction of the rich fauna of the Aravalis,\u201d Rao added, ruefully. District forest department officials say they have advised construction of a tunnel for safe passage of wildlife. \u201cBuilding a simple, green underground tunnel is not rocket science. While it is true that building a wildlife corridor will require a lot of land, which is not available here, a wildlife tunnel or passage can easily be built \u2014 if the passage is as green as forests around, wild animals will definitely use this to cross the road,\u201d explains R P Balwan, former conservator of forests, Gurugram Circle. Nothing, however, has come of this suggestion. \u201cSince the time the Gurugram-Faridabad road has been widened, the forest department raised a demand to build such passages. However, the proposals never saw the light of day,\u201d Balwan added. Incidentally, Asola Bhatti, located on the southeastern edge of Delhi, is home to many indigenous flora and fauna species. Rajasthan, meanwhile, took the initiative to protect wildlife by declaring a wildlife sanctuary, Sariska, covering an area of 866 square kilometres. The Haryana government, on the other hand, has done little to safeguard the expanse of Aravalis between Asola and Sariska, even though this section of the range acts as an important wildlife corridor. In 2017, a study conducted by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) confirmed the presence of 10 carnivore species in the Aravalis of south Haryana. In its recommendations, the WII study called for prioritising conservation in Mangar Bani and other areas contiguous to the Gurugram-Faridabad road, describing these as the \u201clast remnants\u201d for wildlife here. \u201cThe highway can be considered a priority conservation site, because of the fact that it is located amidst the reckless development in this region,\u201d it states.

The check posts will be in addition to the existing six check posts and cover an area of 80 square kilometres. Officials said that these nine check posts will be manned 24X7. The check posts will cover vast forest area between Damdama and Bandhwari. The forest department called it an important step to check increasing tree cutting cases and encroachment attempts in the Aravalis in the two cities. \u201cSince there have been many complaints of tree felling and encroachment attempts, we have proposed to establish nine new check posts along the Gurugram-Faridabad road. The road is a very sensitive area as it is a state highway,\u201d said a senior forest official. The activists, however, called the move a mere eyewash as the forest department hasn\u2019t approved the budget for these check posts and are already facing staff crunch. \u201cThe forest department has sent proposals many times for check posts, wildlife guards and equipment. However, hardly any proposal is approved. I think the department should manage the existing check posts and then establish more. Nevertheless, there is a need to understand that staff strength should be increased to manage these check posts,\u201d said Vaishali Rana Chandra, an environmentalist. Till February last year, the department had only 11 check posts in the Gurugram division, which included the two ranges \u2014 Gurugram and Sohna. However, by March 2018, the check posts at Damdama, Bandhwari, Bar Gujjar, Kachra Chowk (now known as Khushbu Chowk) and Abheypur had become non-operation. Also, the department earlier had four guards at one check post and nine protection watchers for the Aravalis but after March 2018, the number of protection watchers decreased to one at each check post. Last year, a group of city-based environmentalists met Union environment minister Harsh Vardhan demanding an increase in the number of check posts in the Aravalis. In 2004, the Supreme Court had banned all non-forest activities in Aravalis. Also, Section 4&5 of Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA), prohibits any kind of non-forest activity in the Aravalis.

But while the authorities struggle to meet demand, very little is being done to protect the \u2018bhood\u2019, the sandy foothills of the Aravalis which are a major source of groundwater recharge. The bhood areas are sand dunes that typically occur on the western flanks of the Aravali hills. Due to their porous nature, they have high percolation levels and serve as a vital groundwater recharge zone, especially for the excess water flowing down the rocky Aravali slopes during the monsoon. These sandy foothills comprise sand deposits that have been carried by the desert winds from the Thar over millions of years. When the winds hit the barrier that is the Aravali range, they drop their load of sand. According to Vijay Dhasmana, an ecologist with NGO IamGurugram, the foothills act as aquifers by collecting monsoonal overflow. \u201cThe protection of hillocks and sandy foothills is as important as the protection of the Aravali hills,\u201d emphasises Dhasmana, adding that these hillocks have an ecology all their own. In Gurugram, large parts of villages like Bandhwari and Gwalpahari are classified as sandy foothills. Altogether, the district has 1113.28 hectares of similar topography \u2014 while Bandhwari has 287.22 hectares of foothills, Sohna, Bhondsi and Gwal Pahari have over 100 hectares. Activists believe the bhood belt requires urgent legal protection, which won\u2019t happen without political will. But, says environmentalist Vaishali Rana Chandra, lack of intent shown by politicians has led to uncertainty over the status of the foothills, leading to their degradation. \u201cThe groundwater levels in the bhood areas have gone down drastically because of rampant encroachment and construction \u2014 they are going down in the villages as these have large part of foothills in the Aravalis,\u201d explains Rana. \u201cAs there is ambiguity over the status of yet-to-be-decided category (including bhood area), the authorities have allowed multiple builders to colonise the bhood areas in Gwalpahari and other villages, while they are taking an eternity to decide the status of these areas,\u201d she rued. At present, one lakh hectares of land (approx.) fall under the Aravalis, spread across five districts of southern Haryana. More than 25,000 hectares have been classified as forest under sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, while around 62,000 hectares have been identified as natural conservation zone (NCZ). Another 12,800 hectares in the hills have been placed under the yet-to-be-decided NCZ category. \u201cAs per the directions of the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB), dated December 4, 2017, the bhood areas in Haryana are equivalent to the specified areas of the MoEF (Ministry of Environment and Forests) notification of 1992 and should therefore be included in the NCZ, especially when they are close to \u2018gair mumkin pahar\u2019 areas,\u201d points out Chetan Agarwal, a forest analyst (\u2018gair mumkin pahar\u2019 is defined as land that is not cultivable). Incidentally, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) had tagged the entire Gurugram district \u2014 and some blocks in Faridabad, Mewat, Rewari and Narnual \u2014 as a \u2018dark zone\u2019, indicating that groundwater levels have fallen. Still, it is estimated that the entire Aravalis conserve over 20 lakh litres of water per hectare every year, with just one-third of the annual rainfall of 600mm. The annual economic value of the water recharge is around Rs 25 lakh. All the more reason, then, to make preservation of the \u2018bhood\u2019 a priority.

If you fail, it is always tragic.\" Mandrake's body was fished out on Monday\"Bound and chained, Mandrake was lowered 30 feet under water.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

He said the Authority had been in talks with NHAI for taking over the project, but the central agency has declined the offer. This has made it difficult to carry out work on the elevated road and Yamuna bridge, both of which connect Noida with Faridabad in Haryana. \u201cThere are some small patches in between that also need to be connected. In some areas, we need to begin from scratch and even acquire land for the expressway.

The FNG expressway was proposed in 2016 and has been delayed for over three years as the project kept shifting between multiple agencies. Since the expressway will connect three cities from two states, the local agencies were hoping that it will be completed by the NHAI.

Sources revealed the party may field Malik on one of the two seats considered pocket boroughs of the Congress\u2019s Hoodas, ie Sonipat or Rohtak. Preferably, she will contest from Rohtak, but if that doesn\u2019t work out for unforeseen circumstances, BJP will give her the Sonipat ticket. Malik (48) joined BJP on March 25, and there were initial speculations the party will field her from Karnal. However, with the last date of filing nominations approaching, the party has begun considering her for Rohtak or Sonipat. Meanwhile, Congress appears ready to continue with Deepender Singh Hooda in Rohtak, though it is yet to decide whether to field his father, former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, from Faridabad or Sonipat, with the latter considered a bigger possibility by insiders. Hooda Jr is very popular among Rohtak voters. He is appreciated for the infrastructure development that has taken place in the area during his time, and helped him stand his ground in 2014, when the Modi Wave washed away competition across the state. But BJP is facing a real problem finding a suitable candidate for this seat. Not only do they not have a Jat candidate for the seat, their current Rohtak MLA, Manish Grover, is not popular in the rural areas of Rohtak. BJP wants a candidate who is popular and from the Jat community. In fact, the party had tried to woo cricketer Virender Sehwag, but the latter refused to join politics. Notably, the seat covers districts of Rohtak, Jhajjar and parts of Rewari. Since 1952, there have been 17 elections, in which Jats have won every time, with Congress winning 11 times, while BJP has never won it on its own. The Sonipat seat includes districts of Sonipat and parts of Jind. Here, the incumbent, Remesh Kaushik of BJP, had lately expressed his lack of interest in contesting the parliamentary elections.  He has since had a change of mind, but the party is not keen on fielding him any longer, and certainly not from Sonipat. On top of that, if Congress fields Hooda Sr from Sonipat, BJP will be in a bigger dilemma over candidate selection. Malik checks various boxes as a suitable candidate to compete against the Hoodas. She is a Jat, comes from an Army family, has won medals for the country, comes with a clean profile, has been involved with social causes and is a good orator. All this works in the party\u2019s favour.

But while these trees were being sacrificed at the altar of development, citizen-led protests to save existing green cover have been gaining momentum. While authorities claim that compensatory afforestation will help offset damage to environment, residents and environmentalists have called such claims hollow. Most of the time, they argue, plantation takes place in an area far from where the trees have been felled. And besides, ensuring the survival of saplings planted during afforestation drives remains a major challenge. Further, many believe compensatory afforestation \u2014 plantation at one location to compensate for loss of green cover in another \u2014 has too many flaws. \u201cThe concept of compensatory afforestation is we forests at one place and then reconstruct it somewhere else but it takes millions of years to create ecosystems,\u201d says C R Babu, professor emeritus at Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems, Delhi University. \u201cWe can restore a degraded ecosystem, but creating it is extremely difficult and takes time,\u201d he adds. Ecologist Vijay Dhasmana says emphasis should be on cultivating habitats. \u201cThe focus of compensatory afforestation should be to carry out habitat creation, not merely plantation drives for numbers. It is not understood that green spaces are home to several birds, animals and insects \u2014 they are seen merely as a bunch of trees,\u201d he says. \u201cAlso, while we have specific guidelines for road engineering and construction of flyovers/underpasses, there are no specifications or guidelines to carry out plantation drives,\u201d he adds. Some feel that while policy has been well-drafted and is self-sufficient, implementation is lacking. \u201cOne of the major issues is that permission under the Forest Conservation Act for diversion of land for non-forest purposes can be given only for 15 years. But the forest department never reclaims the land (after 15 years). If the department continues to give permission for diversion of land for non-forest purposes, it will soon be left with no land to carry out compensatory afforestation,\u201d says R P Balwan, former conservator of forests, Gurgaon circle. In such a scenario, he continues, plantation drives will be carried out only in areas under the forest department\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201cThese areas might be hundreds of kms away from the cities where green cover is destroyed for infrastructural development,\u201d he adds. It takes little to wipe out a forest, then, but not much thought is given to re-greening. \u201cFirst, there should be a proper study on how many trees can be saved while carrying out any infrastructural development. Second, attempts should be made to transplant some tree species that are less than 10-15 years old. Third, and most important, is to focus on creating a habitat and an ecosystem \u2014 it should not just be plantation of some saplings,\u201d says Babu. Yet others say compensatory afforestation should take place as close as possible to the site where a canopy has been removed. \u201cThe department should study the topography and decide on the density of trees and kind of species that should be planted. For example, Dhau would survive very well on the rocky Aravalis along the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road, while species of Jaal, Khajoor, Babul will survive well in the submerged areas around Najafgarh,\u201d Dhasmana explains. Additionally, there\u2019s no reason why green belts and road dividers, or any stretch around roads where trees have been cut, cannot become forest land. \u201cWhile I feel that the policy of compensatory afforestation is well-defined, there is a need to device a mechanism to give more land to the forest departments. It is possible only if urban forests are created,\u201d shares a senior scientist from the Forest Research Institute, Dehradun. What can likely make a difference is residents taking part in plantation drives. \u201cThe reason why Delhi-NCR has recently witnessed several protests to safeguard tree cover is lack of transparency while carrying out compensatory afforestation. What we see is massive tree-cutting drives to build concrete flyovers and underpasses \u2014 we hardly see any successful plantation drives,\u201d rues Anindita, a Sector 109 resident who spearheaded a \u2018Chipko\u2019 movement last year to protest against tree-felling at Atul Kataria Chowk. She advocates afforestation activity near residential colonies and corporate offices which own big spaces in Delhi-NCR.

A police officer said they had found the body of a Pakistani terrorist and seized arms and ammunition from the encounter site. The identity of the slain terrorist was being ascertained.

In the third attack in 24 hours, terrorists lobbed a grenade at the headquarters of the 180 CRPF battalion camp in Tral sub-district of Pulwama late on Monday evening. The grenade exploded outside the headquarters. No casualties have been reported. The first attack happened on Monday morning when a team of security men was on a cordon-and-search operation in Achabal. Terrorists fired at the team, who then retaliated. In the Pulwama attack, the terrorists after setting off the IED, opened fire at the Army vehicle. \"Initial reports reveal the vehicle suffered extensive damage,\" the official said.

The demolition began early morning in the presence of 250 cops, along with officials of DTCP, Municipal Corporation of Faridabad and the sub-divisional magistrate, Badhkal, who were part of a committee formed last month to oversee the drive. By evening, 13 properties, mostly belonging to retired Army officers, advocates and bureaucrats were demolished. In adherence to the Supreme Court\u2019s March 31 deadline, the properties had been vacated before the drive was carried out. According to the deputy commissioner, the demolition drive could continue on Tuesday. \u201cOur demolition drive continued throughout Monday. By evening, we completed the task,\u201d Faridabad deputy commissioner Atul Kumar told TOI. Sources said owners of all 13 properties scheduled for demolition on Monday had vacated their premises on time. Of the 13, three properties only had boundary walls. \u201cAs they were given prior notices and were repeatedly called for meetings, the residents vacated their premises well before our drive began. We also had sufficient police personnel with us,\u201d said a senior DTCP official. The Supreme Court, in a September 11, 2018 order to check illegal construction in the Aravalis, directed that properties in Kant Enclave be demolished before December 31, 2018, terming them illegal as they were built on forest land protected under Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) 1900. The deadline was later extended to March 31.  For a further 22 property owners, the deadline was extended to July 31, 2019, as they had submitted an undertaking in the Supreme Court seeking more time to vacate their premises. Seven more house owners later filed similar undertakings, and were also exempted from Monday\u2019s drive. The apex court had also directed authorities to deposit Rs 5 crore for the rehabilitation of the damaged area of the Aravalis, and to pay compensation to the house owners affected by the order. Officials have already received bank account details of the property owners affected by the order, for the transfer of compensation money. Each owner will get approximately Rs 50 lakh to offset construction costs, while the builder has to refund the cost of land with 18% interest. Spread over 425 acre, the licence for Kant Enclave was granted in 1984, but was developed by R Kant and Co. in 1990. Out of a total of 1,600 plots, only 42 plots in the colony were occupied, in which lived around 60 families.

The villagers fear that the groundwater \u2014 only source of water for them \u2014 has been polluted like it was found to have been in three other villages \u2014 Bandhwari, Mangar (Faridabad) and Dera (Delhi) \u2014 where tests were carried out earlier. \u201cIt is an alarming situation in terms of groundwater contamination for people living close to the Bandhwari landfill. In a 2017 report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the groundwater of three villages (Bandhwari, Dera and Mangar) was termed not fit for human and animal consumption. What is more worrying is that there are four more villages in the immediate vicinity of the landfill where the groundwater, in all probability, had also been exposed to these high levels of contamination. However, no tests have been carried out by the authorities concerned to verify any kind of groundwater contamination in these villages. We demand groundwater testing in these villages, as well,\u201d said Vaishali Rana Chandra, an environmental activist who wrote to HSPCB about the demand. \u201cAs groundwater contamination by leachate has increased manifold in the past two years, we are sure that all surrounding areas, including my village (Gwal Pahari), has been affected. The problem is that most of the residents still rely on groundwater for consumption. We, therefore, demand groundwater testing at the earliest,\u201d said a villager from Gwalpahari, who did not wish to be named. The dumping of more than 1,600 tonnes of mixed waste at the plant, every day, creates to a stream of dirty black water, also known as leachate. Recently, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) came down heavily on the Haryana government and directed authorities to carry out damage impact study and test groundwater samples in Bandhwari and other surrounding areas. Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB (North), said, \u201cWe have forwarded the concerns raised by the residents to the CPCB, and the MCG commissioner who can help analyse the previous records (before the plant came up) and present situation.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

In the 1990s, fly ash, mixed with water, was dumped in the area from a thermal power plant operated by Haryana Power Generation Corporation Ltd. The plant was shut down in 2011 and over the next five years, vegetation grew over the wet ash, ensuring that the fly ash did not cause any pollution. However, in 2016, the government gave permission for transportation of the fly ash to other places for construction. The vegetation was removed and currently, around 100 truckloads of dry fly ash are lifted from the site, every day. TOI visted the spot and found out that an 80-metre hole has been dug in the area. Last year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed authorities to install sprinklers in the area, and install sheets around the site to control dust pollution. However, we found out that nothing has been done in this regard.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

It has also been alleged that the farmhouse was built by changing nature of the land and endangering fragile ecology of the Aravalis in violation of a government notification issued in 1992. The case was registered at Bhondsi police station on Sunday after Haryana Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) filed a complaint on the direction of a special environment court in Faridabad. Aravali Retreat is spread across a 1,200-acre land in Raisina village, and has around 675 farmhouses. The documents accessed by TOI revealed that the 1,200-acre land was a mining site till 1987, when Ansals purchased it from several individuals. The pollution board in its complaint stated that a public notice was issued on August 22, 1989, by the divisional forest officer in Gurugram to the buyers of farmhouses in Aravali hills of Raisina that the 1,200-acre land is a revenue estate notified under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) 1900, and anyone found violating the provisions of the Act shall be liable for prosecution. Subsequently, the environment ministry had issued a notification on May 7, 1992, prohibiting any non-forest activities in the Aravalis. On February 7, 2006, a public notice was issued by the director of the state environment department, asking violators in the Aravalis to appear before the pollution control board to present their case. It was alleged the farmhouses were constructed on the land tagged as \u201cgair mumkin pahar\u201d in revenue records in 1990. Later in 1991, in connivance with the revenue officials the land category was allegedly changed from \u201cgair mumkin pahar\u201d to \u201cgair mumkin farmhouse\u201d in revenue records to circumvent the Aravali notification. When the change of revenue records came to light in 2005-06, a committee was formed under the then deputy commissioner of Gurugram. The complaint also claimed the then deputy commissioner had inspected the area on February 23, 2006, and found that the land was part the hills. He, according to the complaint, had directed revenue officials to correct the revenue entry from \u201cgair mumkin farmhouse\u201d to \u201cgair mumkin pahar\u201d. It has been alleged that the revenue record was forged in collusion with revenue officials and the nature of the land, from \u201cgair mumkin pahar\u201d was changed to \u201cgair mumkiri farmhouse\u201d. There is no category called \u201cgair mumkin farmhouse\u201d in the revenue statutes. \u201cThe accused had willfully committed grave violation of Arvali notification and degraded fragile ecology of the Aravalis by constructing a farmhouse and altering natural land after the notification of 1992 that prohibits non-forest activities,\u201d said an HSPCB official. Countering the allegations, Kuldeep Kohli, the legal consultant of Aravali Retreat Raisina Welfare Association and owner of one of the farmhouses, said, \u201cThe approval from the DTCP was taken before the MoEF notification was issued.

She had alleged that the accused sought sexual favours from the girls on the pretext of helping them in the exams. \"I met the girl at the college today.

It\u2019s pertinent to mention that the demolition work of the existing constructions in the colony will start any time after March 31, 2019, in compliance with the SC order. The state of Haryana won\u2019t be responsible for damage/loss, if any, during the demolition drive,\u201d states the notice issued by the senior town planner of Faridabad. In January this year, Supreme Court extended the deadline for about 22 houses (whose owners filed affidavits) from March 31 to July 31. Some of these house owners also urged that time to vacate premises should be extended, as they were mostly senior citizens and need more time to search for alternative accommodation. Seven more house owners filed an affidavit later in the SC. They are likely to get an extension soon. But the remaining plot owners don\u2019t live in the colony, and have only built boundary walls. \u201cApart from the public notice, we have sent emails to all affected house owners. We also called house owners for a meeting on Friday, and told them they need to vacate their premises as per SC orders. Our information is that most have already vacated their premises,\u201d said a senior official of DTCP. Brigadier M B Anand (71), VSM (retired), a resident of Kant Enclave, said, \u201cMost families that live here have filed affidavits to seek more time. I filed mine on March 15, as I was away for medical treatment. I have served the country for many years and I hope the Apex court will at least give us some time, as we\u2019re not seeking any benefit, just some more time to relocate.\u201d A committee comprising sub-divisional magistrate (Badhkal), an official of the municipal corporation of Faridabad, and the district town planner (enforcement) will carry out the demolition. The Faridabad police commissioner will arrange the security for the drive, whose exact date is yet to be declared. On September 11, 2018, the SC ordered demolition of houses to check illegal construction in Aravalis, under provisions of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) 1900. \u201cKant Enclave is a forest or is forest land or is required to be treated as a forest or forest land,\u201d stated the order, directing the state government to demolish unauthorised structures in the area. The Apex court also directed authorities to deposit Rs 5 crore for the rehabilitation of the damages to Aravalis, and to pay compensation to the house owners affected by the order. Authorities have already sought bank details of the affected house owners to transfer their share of the compensation. Spread over 425 acre, Kant Enclave was developed by R Kant and Co in 1990.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

A month ago, water from the waste treatment plant had seeped out of the boundary walls causing an environmental threat, as the site is close to the forest area and leachate could lead to contamination of groundwater. On Saturday when TOI visited the site, leachate along the boundary wall was replaced by mud. Ecogreen officials claimed that they sucked up the leachate and dumped mud at the site. \u201cWe will now carry out a plantation drive there. We have dug up a drain around the periphery, which will be used for flow of rainwater. The water will then be released into the stormwater drain,\u201d said an official. He added that they will cover the legacy waste mound with high-density polythene sheet so that when it rains, more leachate is not created. Asked if it would be feasible to cover the whole landfill with the sheet, the official said they will cover it as much as possible. A separate section will be demarcated for dumping fresh waste. Sources said around 2,200 tonnes of waste comes to Bandhwari every day. According to MCG officials, while Ecogreen is treating fresh leachate and separating fresh waste using a ballistic separator, the agency is struggling to treat legacy waste. Ecogreen says it is not under its purview to treat legacy waste. The MCG commissioner, however, told TOI that treatment of legacy waste is the firm\u2019s responsibility. Ecogreen officials said they need additional land for proper disposal of waste. \u201cWe have 30 acres for Gurugram and Faridabad.

MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav said: \u201cAccording to an agreement, they were supposed to clear the legacy waste site and use the land. The agreement says they will be given additional land only once they clear the legacy waste.\u201d On Friday, we had reported that the MCG has hired another private agency for the treatment of legacy leachate.

The crowded stretch with malls, hospitals and offices will be made easier for movement with widening and the construction of underpasses and flyovers. Press Enclave Road provides access from Khirki Village, Hauz Rani, Saket, Malviya Nagar and Pushp Vihar, and connects commercial hubs. Once the revamp starts, PWD is likely to take around a year to finish the work. PWD officials said that the dividers and footpaths on these roads would be shifted and encroachments removed to provide space for pedestrians and cyclists. The plan also suggests the regulation of non-motorised vehicles, which, officials consider to be the main reason for the congestion. According to the officials, there is an alternative plan that envisages a skywalk in addition to the provisions of the first plan. The redevelopment plan includes an 800-metre underpass at the Chirag Delhi intersection (where Outer Ring Road meets Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg going to Panchsheel Enclave). At present, there is heavy congestion at the intersection through the day, especially so during peak hours. Further down, PWD will erect a kilometre-long flyover at the point where Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg meets Press Enclave Road. Apart from this, it will also construct an underpass from Press Enclave to Lal Bahadur Shastri Road. At the ever crowded Madangir along the stretch, PWD intends to widen the road and create ample space for hawkers and pedestrians. The place will be beautified and trees will be planted to add much-needed greenery. To decongest the network of roads, a double-deck flyover will also be built on Mehrauli-Badarpur Road which Lal Bahadur Shastri Road eventually joins. The approach to the left-turning flyover will be created at the T-point where the two roads meet. These roads connect Delhi with Gurugram and Faridabad apart from linking residential areas such as Tughlakabad, Tigri, Khanpur, Saket and Mehrauli. Officials admitted that this road section needs to be redesigned, keeping in mind the heavy bus traffic. Officials pointed out that parking is a big concern in the area, with residents of the localities there as strapped for space as the mall-going traffic. PWD hopes to allocate enough space for cars and other vehicles to park on this busy stretch. Officials are also aware that the heavy pedestrian movement from the Malviya Nagar metro station to the Saket District Court slows traffic. According to an official, the budget for this project is approximately Rs 150 crore and the deadline for completion of work is a year after the start of work. Apart from this project, PWD officials are also open to similar plans to decongest other corridors such as the entire Aurobindo Marg, Mathura Road (Neela Gumbad to Badarpur flyover), Outer Ring Road (Chirag Delhi crossing to Savitri flyover), Sardar Patel Marg (Gyarah Murti to Rajokri border) and Dhaula Kuan (Dhaula Kuan flyover to GGR flyover, Sanjay T-Point).

Of the 5.6 lakh residential units stuck across seven cities in India (valued at Rs 4,51,750 crore), over two lakh residential units are delayed in the NCR itself. Of this, 1.04 lakh units (~50%) are in Greater Noida (valued at Rs 45,039 crore), followed by Noida (44,082, Rs 38,511 crore), Ghaziabad (24,728, Rs 9,664 crore), Gurugram (23,287, Rs 25,086 crore), Bhiwadi (5,477, Rs 1,415 crore), Delhi (4,102, Rs 9,930 crore) and Faridabad (3,612, Rs 1,815 crore). These units, which were launched in 2013 or before, have been left in limbo leading to huge mental stress and financial burden on the homebuyers. Anuj Puri, chairman of Mumbai-based real estate research company Anarock, who collated the data, said the new government will have a mammoth task at hand. \u201cLakhs of homebuyers are left in the lurch by their builders, mostly in projects that don\u2019t fall under the regulatory mechanism, Rera\u2019s ambit, as these were launched years before Rera was implemented. That has left homebuyers with no option but to approach courts, which is a tedious task.\u201d He also said delayed projects have severely weakened faith in under-construction properties, and that reviving buyers\u2019 trust is a herculean task. If buyers stop purchasing under-construction properties, builders will have a far more challenging time getting funds from external sources.\u201d The report claims NCR tops the list of cities with maximum number of delayed projects (over 2.10 lakh units) and maximum amount of buyers\u2019 investment riding on it. It\u2019s followed by Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune and Bangalore. \u201cMMR and NCR together hold 72% share of delayed projects, worth Rs 3,49,010 crore. South Indian cities collectively hold a mere 10% of delays, with Chennai having fewest numbers (8,650 units, worth Rs 5,620 crore). Even Bangalore is better off than Pune, with less than half of the latter\u2019s delayed stock of 86,700 units,\u201d the report states. Chairman of Supertech, R K Arora, said the government should work towards clearing roadblocks faced by developers. \u201cThe government has done a lot for buyers by reducing GST rates, etc., but developers are facing problems in financing to complete projects. The crisis is due to multiple factors, including prolonged land disputes and uncertainties arising from reforms such as demonetisation, GST and Rera,\u201d he said. He added liquidity problems are accentuated by last year\u2019s RBI circular, which stopped banks and financial institutions from funding the housing sector. \u201cWe urge the government to look into the liquidity crisis , keeping in mind its goal of \u2018housing for all by 2022\u2019.\u201d Prashant Solomon, MD of developer Chintels, said, \u201cMost affected projects don\u2019t fall under Rera. All projects that received clearances after July 2017 needed to register with Rera, making it better for both buyer and developer.\u201d He also said strictures like Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, strict monitoring of projects and their timelines, etc, has improved safeguarding of investments for both buyers and developers. \u201cHowever, government needs to intervene and take care of affected projects and unsold inventories,\u201d he added. Commenting on the GB Nagar region, Credai (western UP) president Prashant Tiwari said, \u201cThere have been delays because of multiple reasons, but construction has picked up and with Rera in place, every builder is now acting in a time-bound manner.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Garbage burned next to Fbd-Ggn road": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/garbage-burned-next-to-fbd-ggn-road/articleshow/57319758.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Delhi-NCR experiences light to moderate rains, more showers likely": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/delhi-ncr-experience-light-rains/articleshow/69334584.cms", "time": "2019-05-15 11:47:00", "description": "NEW DELHI: Light to moderate rain occurred on Wednesday morning in parts of Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR), including Noida and Faridabad.

The fire allegedly broke out in the clothes shop on the ground floor of the building, which is located in a narrow lane in Faridabad\u2019s Dauba Colony. The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. The playschool, which is attended by around 100 children, was closed for summer vacations. Classes used to be run from a few rooms on the ground and first floors of the building. Nita Bhati (29), the principal of AND Convent School, Vishal Bhati (30), her husband who owns the playschool, and their kids, Yashika (8) and Dev (5), used to reside on the second floor. The main building of the school, which hosts students from classes nursery to 12 and is owned by Vishal\u2019s brother, is in the adjacent lane. When the fire broke out on Saturday, the kids were sleeping in their room. Vishal, who also ran the clothes shop in the building, had left the house to get milk when his neighbours alerted him about the fire. He ran upstairs to alert his family and then came down to shift his car, a Maruti Swift, and two-wheeler, a Honda Activa, from the garage on the ground floor, fearing they could lead to an explosion. Then he tried to go upstairs again to save his family but it was too late. According to eyewitnesses, the fire rapidly engulfed the entire building. \u201cI had returned from the gym when I noticed smoke coming out of the clothes shop. I alerted Vishal, who removed his car and two-wheeler from the garage, fearing they could lead to a blast. Then he tried to go up the narrow staircase to rescue his wife and kids, but couldn\u2019t as the smoke almost choked him. Neighbours tried to douse the flames but could not,\u201d said Rohit Chugh, who lives opposite the building. Some neighbours said that three fire tenders arrived at the scene after 20 minutes but were not equipped to deal with the fire. \u201cThe fire engines arrived but the firemen were not able to enter the building as they did not have the necessary gear. Had this not been the case, the deaths probably would not have occurred,\u201d said neighbour Rajbir Singh. Faridabad deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Garg told TOI that a three-member committee had been formed to find out the reason behind the fire. \u201cThis was a playschool where around 100 kids studied. It is an unfortunate incident and we are trying to find out what led to it. A three-member panel, comprising the Faridabad additional deputy commissioner, the deputy commissioner of police (NIT), and the secretary of the Faridabad municipal commissioner, has been formed. The post-mortem has been done and the cause of the deaths appears to be suffocation.\u201d Garg admitted that the fire department did not seem to be prepared. \u201cWhen I visited the spot, I was told that the firemen were not fully equipped. I will look into this,\u201d he said. Nita and the two kids were rushed to Fortis Escorts, Faridabad, but were declared \u201cbrought dead\u201d by doctors.

Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah.

Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai.
