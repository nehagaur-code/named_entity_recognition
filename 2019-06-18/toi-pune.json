At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Illegal bikes parked on Naylor Road": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/illegalbikesparkedonnaylorroad/articleshow/69764470.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "\nSaraiwwalaa Agrr Refineries Limited introduces Naturralle in Pune\n": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Saraiwwalaa-Agrr-Refineries-Limited-introduces-Naturralle-in-Pune/articleshow/51866922.cms", "time": "", "description": "Saraiwwalaa Agrr Refineries Limited (SARL), one of the leading edible oil companies as a part of their strategic growth introduced a new product under their flagship brand \u2014 Naturralle.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), as a part of its plan to decentralize garbage-handling and stop dumping of unprocessed garbage at the Uruli depot before December 2019, will set up two 100MT plants and one 200MT plant. The 100MT plants will be set up at Ambegaon and Lohegaon, while the 200MT plant will come up at Uruli Devachi to process mixed garbage. The civic body will appoint private agencies to install, commission, operate, and maintain the plants. The sites for the site have already been identified, while sources in the civic body said the agencies will be appointed by next month.

Civic activists, meanwhile, claimed the PMC often plans to set up new processing units but neglects existing ones.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d.

Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets.

At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

FC Road was the scene of chaotic celebrations, as fans in their hundreds had flocked there in the wake of India\u2019s World Cup victory against Pakistan. Things soon got out of hand, with some of them climbing atop cars and even public transport buses. The mob also took over the thoroughfare, causing the traffic to come to a standstill. That was when the police stepped in \u2014 they dispersed the unruly elements of the crowd with a lathicharge, freeing up the roads for traffic. Cricket enthusiasts started gathering on FC Road and the adjacent Jangli Maharaj Road as soon as play resumed after the final rain interruption on Sunday night. By then, it had become apparent that India were headed for big win \u2014 Pakistan needed 136 runs from just five overs. Revellers in cars, motorcycles and scooters came roaring in, shouting slogans and waving the Indian flag. \u201cAs is the case always, the city traffic police and the local police stations of Deccan Gymkhana and Shivajinagar closed Fergusson College Road to traffic,\u201d a senior police officer told TOI. \u201cHowever, before the road was barricaded, some four-wheelers and two-wheelers drove onto the rode and were parked there,\u201d the officer said. Fans shouted, raised slogans and burst firecrackers. Some of them played loud music in their cars, while others danced on top of cars, police said. The revellers celebrated the emphatic win for hours. \u201cWe allowed them to celebrate, but, at the same time, we wanted to open the road to traffic,\u201d the officer said. \u201cWe requested the fans revellers at Sambhaji Bridge, Good Luck Chowk, and the stretch between Vaishali restaurant and Fergusson College\u2019s main gate to disperse. However, they ignored our entreaties and continued to dance and created a ruckus.\u201d Soon, police vans reached the area and some revellers cleared off. A few minutes later, most of them had dispersed, daunted by the police presence. \u201cWe thought we could finally restore vehicular movement on the road, but within minutes, the unruly fans had come back on the road,\u201d the officer added. Around 1.15am on Monday, police called for reinforcements on FC Road and quick response team rushed to the spot. \u201cWe used the public address system to disperse the crowd, but nobody budged,\u201d the officer said. He said they were left with no choice but to use lathis on the crowd. \u201cOnce the police raised their lathis, the crowd dispersed and did not return,\u201d the officer said. Some time later, a vehicle made the rounds of JM Road and other adjoining roads and found that the fans had cleared out from there too. The officer said they were not against such celebrations, as long as they were within limits. \u201cNobody, including police, can stop people from celebrating such occasions. But at the same time, people should be mindful of the law. We requested them to leave the road for the convenience of others, but they did not heed us. In such a situation, we retorted to a mild lathicharge. No one was injured,\u201d the officer said. Civic activists voiced their support to the police and said the authorities must exercise their power and keep things under control; law and order should be the first priority, they said. \u201cTough action should be taken against those indulging in hooliganism.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath. The Pro tem speaker ruled that the members stick to the format provided. After this, the members of BJP started adding 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' after end of every oath. Some of the prominent names who took oath from Madhya Pradesh included K P Yadav who defeated Jyotiraditya Scindia, Rakesh Singh, Ramakant Bhargava and Nakul Nath.

Last week, due to Cyclone Vayu in the Arabian Sea, the city received significant showers. But with the weakening of the system, conditions are now becoming favourable for further advance of the south-west monsoon into more parts of the country. In the city, rainfall recorded since June 1 by IMD Colaba observatory was 101mm, while at Santa Cruz, it was 140mm. The rain departure in case of Colaba and Santa Cruz was -126.9 and -60.9 respectively. \u201cWhile surface winds are favourable (southwesterly), the wind pattern needs support till mid-level, which is currently lagging. Conditions are becoming favourable for the further onset of monsoons in 4-5 days,\u201d said Shubhangi Bhute, scientist, IMD Mumbai. On when the onset was expected over Mumbai, she said it may take 2-3 days to reach southern parts of Konkan, and thereafter to Mumbai around June 20-21. Rainfall was reported from many parts of the city on Monday, but the showers were short-lived. \u201cLower level winds are incurring the moisture, hence we are witnessing convective activity, but it has to sustain the monsoon pattern, which is lagging. We are waiting for sufficient moisture in the atmosphere,\u201d she added. Convection in the atmosphere is the way air floats up on account of being warmer than surrounding air. Maximum temperatures in the city continued to remain on the higher side on Monday hovering around 34 degrees Celsius.

Expertise in physics is the easiest way to make a career in astronomy. Tarun Souradeep, senior professor at IUCAA, said during his time, the engineering syllabus had a much broader view which allowed him to move to physics for a master\u2019s degree. \u201cIt is not the case any more as engineering has become much more focused. I do not believe that you need a specialized course in astrophysics or such in the undergraduate level to become an astrophysicist. What is required is a good fundamental knowledge of physics as everything is eventually an applied version of physics.\u201d Sukanta Bose, science lead of the LIGO-India Project, said while pure physics in graduation will do, there is a need for a master\u2019s thesis as well as smaller projects in the astronomy related field during the postgraduate course if a student wishes to have a career in astronomy. \u201cCentres like IUCAA are mandated by the University Grants Commission to expand astronomy courses in Indian universities so that at least when graduating there is enough representation of astronomy among other sciences. We are currently in process of working with Savitribai Phule Pune University to have students enrolled in MSc Physics do something exclusively in astrophysics for their master\u2019s thesis,\u201d Bose said. Varun Bhalerao, assistant professor at IIT Bombay said even if a student is unable to make a career in astrophysics despite taking up physics in their masters and PhD course, he or she can get a job in industries as they too are opening up their recruitment drives to students with a PhD. But he advises students to make sure that their PhDs are on a good subject and from a good institute. \u201cA PhD in physics means you have taken up a problem which nobody has solved as yet. In the years of research, you are solving the problem and submitting your research for your PhD degree. Industries also want people with excellent fundamental knowledge who can solve problems innovatively and research students fit the bill. While there is a huge difference in the recruitment of PhD students in foreign countries, the Indian industry is opening up too,\u201d Bhalerao said. Bhalerao who took up engineering for his bachelor\u2019s degree says despite his course work, he made sure that he kept himself up-to-date with physics and did projects in the astronomy sector. \u201cBut I got a lot of rejections when I was applying for my research in astrophysics because there were students of physics who were always given preference. Hence, if a student knows that he or she wants a career in astrophysics, it is always better to take physics in the undergraduation and specialize along with mathematics, computers and statistics,\u201d Bhalerao added. Arvind Paranjpye, director of Nehru Planetarium, said in the present scenario, engineering students have an option of doing PhD with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) after graduation through the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. \"With the kind of leap ISRO is taking, the basics of space science should come down to primary level. Astronomy should be taken to schools. These days small kits and models are available for space-related things which could be introduced at the school level itself,\" Paranjpye said.

The Kothrud police said the accident occurred around 10.30pm on the steep slope connecting Chandni Chowk to Paud Road. A resident of the Siddhivinayak Krupa society, Surekha Pradeep Wani was critically injured and was taken to Sassoon General Hospital. Doctors in the hospital declared her dead on arrival. Her husband, Pradeep Wani (64), was injured in his leg while trying to avert the collision. The police have arrested the truck driver for negligent driving. The scooterist who had flouted the rule fled the spot. On Sunday, Wani told TOI that he had gone to a friend\u2019s house in Bavdhan with his wife, their two sons and daughters-in-law for dinner on Saturday. \u201cWe usually travel together in car. But we went to Bavdhan on our two-wheelers because one of my sons had bought tickets for a play after the dinner,\u201d he said. Around 10.30pm, Wani and his wife left Bavdhan for home on his two-wheeler. \u201cI was descending the slope near Chandni Chowk to reach Paud Road. I suddenly spotted a man on a white scooter speeding in from the opposite direction towards Chandni Chowk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe person was riding along the wrong side of the road, which is not only narrow but is also dangerous because of the steep slope. I started shouting at the scooterist to alert him that he was violating the wrong-side rule. He, however, paid no attention and kept on speeding,\u201d Wani said. \u201cAll that I remember that a multi-axle truck was passing by us. I cannot recall what happened at that moment. I felt a jerk in the scooter and my wife fell on the right side of the road. Her left leg and hand came under the wheels of the heavily loaded truck,\u201d he said. The accident survivor said despite all his attempts, he could not remove Surekha out of the truck. \u201cShe remained stuck under the wheels of the truck and kept on looking at me helplessly. Someone contacted the police and ambulance,\u201d Wani said. A police team reached the spot and managed to remove Surekha from the spot. She was taken to the Sassoon hospital, where the doctors pronounced her dead on arrival. Kothrud police inspector Shankar Khatke told TOI that the Mumbai-bound truck was also descending the slope. \u201cWe have arrested the truck driver,\u201d he said. The left side of the slope that connects Chandni Chowk to Paud Road has been dug up for the ongoing Chandni Chowk flyover work. The road is already narrow and has become more risky, especially during night hours, because of the flyover work. The police have restricted the entry of vehicles from Paud Road to avoid accidents. However, many people violate the rule to avoid a detour to reach Bavdhan. Kothrud traffic branch inspector Ajay Chandkhede said, \u201cA team of Kothrud police has been deployed where the slope connects the bypass during day time. Similarly, a team of Warje police is deployed at Chandni chowk. We are regularly taking action against the people violating the no-entry rule.\u201d Wrong-side driving has become rampant across the city, leading to quite a few accidents across the city (see graphic). Inspector Khatke said as per police commissioner K Venkatesham\u2019s directions, action was being taken against the wrong-side drivers under Section 279 (rash driving) of the Indian Penal Code. If convicted under the section, a driver can be fined Rs1,000 or face imprisonment for up to six months, or both. On June 6, the traffic branch had taken action against 67 motorists for wrong-side driving.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Officials said around 8,000 tankers may be required in the next few days unless rains arrive in the state by next week. Two years ago, chief minister Fadnavis had set a target of making Maharashtra tanker-free by 2019 under the flagship initiative Jalyukt Shivar. State relief and rehabilitation officials said, since the state has been facing severe drought and water shortage, demand for tankers has gone up even as adequate mitigation measures have been put in place. Officials said the requirement for tankers this year has been the highest in the last many years. Fadnavis recently directed senior bureaucrats to visit water-parched areas to review the implementation of various schemes. He also directed the government to undertake repair and restoration of water supply schemes and acquisition of wells in affected areas on a priority basis. The state government has now deployed the highest number of water tankers \u2014 6,905 as of June 15 \u2014 to meet the drinking water needs of the parched region. This is more than three times the number of tankers (1,801) deployed around this time last year. In 2016, around 6,000 tankers were deployed due to deficient monsoon. \u2018Poor rainfall increased the tanker requirements in all places. Even schemes such as Jal Yukt Shivar Abhiyan could not be started due to poor rainfall last year,\u2019\u2019 stated senior officials from the relief and rehabilitation department. The official further added that they would be ready with another 1,000 tankers in the days to come with private operators from every district roped in to meet the requirement. Nearly 5,506 villages have been affected and they are now entirely dependent on water tankers for their daily needs. The Marathwada region is the worst hit with maximum number of tankers deployed in the area. In all, 3,492 tankers have been deployed in Aurangabad division, while around 1,000 tankers are in operation in Pune and Nashik divisions. Jalna has the highest number of tankers in operation at 1,157, Aurangabad has 1,129 in operation daily, according to officials from the relief and rehabilitation department. Altogether 778 villages are completely dependent on tankers in Aurangabad, while 549 villages are affected in Jalna followed by 666 villages in Beed, where 960 tankers are in operation. The water scarcity has also hit livestock, with about 10 lakh animals sheltered in cattle camps. Of the 17 major reservoirs listed by the Central Water Commission (CWC), with a total live capacity of 14.073 billion cubic metres, the live storage until June first week was 5.5%. \u201cParts of Marathwada and North Maharashtra are among the worst-affected. In around 2,000 villages across the state, the groundwater levels were found to be more than 3 metres lower than the five-year average. The Maharashtra Groundwater (Development and Management) Act needs to be amended soon to regulate extraction of water,\u2019\u2019 said an activist. Last week, the chief minister had sanctioned a Rs-30-crore proposal for cloud-seeding experiments in dam catchment areas of Marathwada, North Maharashtra, and Vidarbha. \u201cWe will carry out experiments after taking due guidance from the experts,\u201d stated the officials from relief and rehabilitation department. The state had carried out cloud-seeding experiments in 1992 in the catchment areas, which supply water to Mumbai. In 2015, too, the state had conducted the experiments and said that they were able to induce 1300 mm rainfall.

The city which sent eight BJP MLAs to the assembly and had two ministers till recently will now be deprived of any ministerial representation. Dilip Kamble, the only ministerial representative from Pune, was dropped in the reshuffle effected on Sunday. Kamble, who represents Pune Cantonment assembly constituency, was the minister of state for social justice and special assistance. The other minister, Girish Bapat, who was elected as Member of Parliament recently, resigned from the state assembly. He was the minister for food, civil supplies and consumer protection, food and drugs administration, parliamentary affairs in the Devendra Fadnavis government. \u201cI was among the first 10 state ministers who took oath as soon as the government was formed in 2014. I am happy with my tenure and grateful to the party and the chief minister for the opportunity to work as a minister,\u201d Kamble told TOI on Sunday. During his tenure, he took some landmark decisions that will help youngsters from the deprived classes in the long run, he said. They include ease of providing caste certificates, scholarships for international studies and building hostels for needy students. The minister had courted controversy over some remarks which he had later backtracked after public anger swelled. He was embroiled in an alleged case of corruption. The police, acting on directives from the court, had registered a case against him and four others for allegedly cheating a trader by promising him two liquor shop licences. Kamble said controversies would happen with people in public life and he has moved on. He added that he would come out clean. The opposition parties have expressed surprise over leaving out Pune without minister to represent it. The BJP on the other hand claimed that the cabinet changes will not adversely impact the city\u2019s development. \u201cPune is the second biggest city after Mumbai and not having a single minister is strange. Such a big metropolis must have a ministerial representative. It helps in putting forward the issues of the city and generating funds for development works,\u201d Ramesh Bagwe, city unit chief of Congress and former state minister, said. Several BJP leaders in the city said the reshuffle and the absence of any representative from Pune will not affect the development projects in the city. \u201cThe decision to make changes in the state cabinet is taken at the chief minister\u2019s office level.

As a result, the villagers have to first go to the Bopkhel phata on the Pune-Alandi Road and then go to their destination in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. The villagers conducted hunger strikes and agitations for the early construction of an alternate road to link Bopkhel to Khadki by constructing a bridge on Mula river. Rajendra Pawar, defence estate officer (DEO), Pune circle had sent a letter to the PCMC in April 2018 stating that the value of the land needed for bridge and road for Bopkhel was Rs25.81crore. Meanwhile, Mangala Ghule, the former Pimpri Chinchwad city organizer, told the government to arrange for land for the defence authorities in lieu of the defence land, for four months. In January 2019, the high court directed the PCMC to start the road construction in two weeks as a result the PCMC invited bids for the project.

Opposing Punalekar\u2019s bail plea on CBI\u2019s behalf, Suryavanshi argued that the Punalekar\u2019s advice is not legal and his acts are not protected under Section 126 (professional communication) of the Evidence Act. He submitted that this is not a simple case under section 201 (destroying evidence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Investigations have revealed that Punalekar has aided and abetted Kalaskar, Suryawanshi said. The CBI\u2019s reply opposing the bail plea said it has found that Punalekar gave shelter to an accused in the Goa blast in his residential building at Mumbai thus aiding and abetting murder and his acts also fall under the terrorist act under section 15 of the Unlawful (Activities) Prevention Act (UAPA). The prosecution will continue with its arguments on June 19. Earlier, Suryavanshi told the judge R M Pande that a lawyer can give legal advice to his client like surrendering himself before the police, filing anticipatory bail plea and filing petition for quashing the case. Punalekar\u2019s advice to Kalaskar, he said, to dismantle firearms is not protected under the Evidence Act. Relying on Dabholkar\u2019s wife Shaila\u2019s statement, Suryvanshi said, \u201cThe victim\u2019s husband was receiving threats from Sanatan Sanshta because they were opposed to his ideology. The threats said Dabholkar would be the second Gandhi to be killed. A newspaper published by sanstha shows a man lying on a floor with a flag pierced in his chest, two days before Dabholkar was shot dead. It shows that the suspects wanted to kill him.\u201d The prosecutor read the confessional statement of Kalaskar referring to Punalekar as the sanstha\u2019s sadak instead of lawyer who had instructed him to destroy the weapons and motorcycle used in the Dabholkar case. \u201cKalaskar\u2019s confession is prima facie admissible because his statement was recorded by an IPS officer. The defence has said that the lawyer\u2019s act was a privileged communication protected under section 201 of the IPC but the CBI has arrested him for committing an offence under sections of the IPC, Arms Act and UAPA. This is the case of a larger conspiracy as after Dabholkar\u2019s murder, comrade Govind Pansare, rationalist M M Kalburgi and journalist Gauri Lankesh were killed. The conspiracy is not over. We don\u2019t know who will be killed next. The CBI is investigating and Punalekar if released on bail will tamper with the evidence,\u201d Suryavanshi argued.

The UGC issued a public notice on Friday to follow the UGC-CARE (Consortium for Academic and Research Ethics) list of journals with immediate effect. \u201cResearch publications only from journals indexed in the UGC-CARE list should be used for all academic purposes,\u201d stated the notification issued by UGC secretary Rajnish Jain. The UGC-CARE list includes 53,560 journals indexed in Scopus and Web of Science \u2014 international database of journals. Only 247 out of 893 analysed by the UGC-CARE cell in Pune and the four UGC-CARE universities made it to the big league. The UGC-CARE cell in Pune rejected almost 84% of the journals it analysed for poor standards, said a source. Many of them allegedly compromised with the publication ethics. \u201cThe fact that only 247 journals qualified after analysis by the UGC-CARE cell at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and the UGC-CARE universities shows the very large presence of predatory journals and academic pollution,\u201d said Bhushan Patwardhan, the UGC vice-chairman, also the chairman of the CARE Empowered Committee. Many research scholars fall in the trap of shady journals out of desperation. \u201cThe high weightage for every international paper in Academic Performance Indicator and mandatory publication of two papers before the submission of PhD thesis create a sort of desperation among students to publish papers quickly and they fall prey to predatory journals. The dubious journals\u2019 publishers assure quick publication of papers after taking money. It is like the Nigerian lottery scam, wherein thousands of students and faculty have fallen prey,\u201d he said. A distinguished professor of SPPU and a member of the CARE Empowered Committee echoed Patwardhan\u2019s view. \u201cPublishing journals had become a business for a few,\u201d the professor said. NAAC chairman V S Chauhan, also a member of the CARE Empowered Committee, told TOI over phone from China, \u201cSome filters were used to select the journals. Those which failed to pass through the filters could not make it to the UGC\u2019s list of journals. It will be a continuous process.\u201d Shubhada Nagarkar, a member of the UGC-CARE\u2019s Pune cell, said, \u201cMany journals could not meet the basic criteria. We found anomalies even in their addresses and the list of editorial board members. Many self-proclaimed international journals lacked global outreach.\u201d The UGC-CARE list contains Indian journals of high credibility from humanities and Indian languages, too. They do not appear in international databases like Scopus. \u201cThe UGC-CARE list is an original list of credible journals,\u201d Patwardhan said in a note of reassurance to research scholars about the list\u2019s trustworthiness.

With the pre-test operation of the entire process proposed to be conducted all over India in select sample units during August and September, census office sources told TOI that three districts in Maharashtra, having both rural and urban population, will be covered and the sample size of the population will be decided soon. However, the districts where the pre-test will be carried out have not been disclosed . A workshop was held in Pune from June 3-11 with master trainers conducting field trials in select areas in Pune district. Senior officials from the state census department said headmasters and teachers will be roped in for the project. The national trainers were trained last month and they are now training master trainers from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Telangan and Goa. They will then train the field functionaries for the pre-test, the officials added. Senior officials said the pre-test will have to be carried out with care in order to finalise the instruments, method and processing of the actual census. The pre-test of census will be extremely challenging as digital mode of data collection will be tested in the field for the first time. This will ensure timely publication of census data. For the Census 2021, enumerators will no longer need to carry voluminous paper to record data, with the Registrar General of India (RGI) and Census Commissioner working on a mobile application that will help them capture data on their respective phones. This will eliminate the laborious process of electronic data entries, besides making compilation of data easier and faster, stated an official. This is for the first time in the 140-year history of the census that the data will be collected through mobile app. Enumerators will be paid appropriate remuneration for using their own mobile devices to record census data, officials said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The winds are changing even in conventional educational spheres with Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) introducing two graduate programmes, one in liberal arts and one in blended science. While the BA Liberal Arts course will allow students choose from a wide range of majors and minors, the blended course is designed such that students study physics, chemistry, environmental science and earth science in the first year and then specialise in a subject which will lead to an undergraduate research thesis. This is comparable to the educational set up in Indian Institute of Science Education and Research with the only difference that IISERs offer a 4-year intensive BS-MS programme as against the university's BSc degree. Experts said the Pune university, with baby steps in new courses, especially by introducing the bachelor's courses for the first time, is steering in the right direction. The BA Liberal Arts course will be launched under vice chancellor Nitin Karmalkar\u2019s pet project Interdisciplinary School for Science (IDSS). This being the first liberal arts course by any state university in Maharashtra and is open to a standard XII passed student. \u201cWe have not kept any limitations as to students from what streams can or cannot apply. There will be an entrance examination and if the student qualifies it, then he or she will be eligible for admission. The course has six semesters where students will pick a \u2018major\u2019 subject and a combination of \u2018minor subjects\u2019, \u2018electives\u2019, \u2018skill- based subjects\u2019, internships, workshops and projects,\u201d course coordinator Vishram Dhole said. The BSc blended course is also open for standard XII students but limited to those from the science stream. The university claims that the course will be quality assured by the University of Melbourne and will be considered similar to a University of Melbourne degree worldwide. This will make students eligible for entry into a University of Melbourne or any international MSc programme. In the first and the second year of the course, students would take up subjects from physics, chemistry, environment sciences, biological sciences and earth science. Based on this general but comprehensive grounding, students can then specialize for a \u2018major\u2019 in the third year. A carefully designed curriculum that integrates subjects across disciplines ensures that the content of all first and second year subjects is optimal for a transition to any major in the third year. The course will give students a comprehensive background in basic sciences and prepare them well for taking up higher studies in any discipline at reputed institutes in India, Australia and other countries, Dhole added. While many students opt for higher studies after a bachelor\u2019s in liberal arts, there are also students who get into the job sector after their bachelor\u2019s education. The job opportunities for students of liberal arts generally depended on the specialization subjects, said Anita Patankar, director, Symbiosis School for Liberal Arts. The alumni of Symbiosis School for Liberal Arts are working with the The World Bank, Asian Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs, Gateway House, MullenLowe Lintas, The Times Group, Red Ice Film Productions, she said. Patankar said the transferable skills that students pick up from the interdisciplinary programme, its innovative teaching-learning methods and assessments and strong research and writing skills help them thrive in diverse domains even when they are not specifically trained.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

On April 29, the court had framed charges against Indian Mujahideen co-founder Bhatkal, who also goes by the name Mohammed Ahmed Zarar Siddibappa, after he was produced before the judge amidst tight security, paving way for the commencement of trial. The case came up for hearing before the special judge R M Pande on Saturday but the evidence of witnesses could not be recorded. During the last hearing, the court had asked the defence lawyer Zaheer Pathan to file his reply on Delhi police\u2019s plea to secure Bhatkal\u2019s presence via video conferencing mode because he was a high-risk prisoner. Pathan in his reply said, \u201cThe Delhi police had no locus standi to file the plea as the same should have been filed by the prosecution and citied Section 273 of the Criminal Procedure Code that the trial should be conducted in the presence of the accused.\u201d The plea read the physical presence of the accused was essential for conducting the trial and seeking instructions because he could not understand the local language as the state anti-terrorism squad, Pune, had filed chargesheet in Marathi. \u201cCo-accused Mirza Himayat Baig was produced before the court for conducting trial. Bhatkal should be shifted to Yerawada jail and trial should be conducted in his presence,\u201d the plea said.

Senior officials from the revenue department said the policy was put forth in November and was to be implemented in March, but it was delayed due to the Lok Sabha elections. The government has yet to receive any proposal, an official said. Land is regulated under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code. About 22,000 housing societies are on collector\u2019s land and can be converted to freehold property, provided the societies approach the respective collectorate. \u201cWe have yet to get any proposals for conversion,\u201d a senior revenue official said. The state cabinet has already decided that the premium charged to convert collector\u2019s land given for housing purposes to freehold land will be 15% of the ready reckoner rate, as opposed to the 50% proposed earlier. Pune collectorate officials also said they haven\u2019t received a single proposal, even though there are more than 100 housing societies on collector\u2019s land. \u201cDue to the elections, I guess there was no proposal,\u201d a senior official surmised, adding they were expecting proposals before the assembly elections. A 25% premium would be changed for the conversion of leasehold land given for residential use. About 37% and 50% were planned initially after taking into consideration the lease period. Meanwhile, a senior official said the premium for converting land given for commercial and industrial purposes would be 50% of ready reckoner rates. \u201cOnce the collector\u2019s land is converted into freehold, it would be freed from the state government\u2019s control; its full development potential can be exploited. It is, however, not mandatory to make collector\u2019s land freehold. It is just a provision,\u201d another revenue official said. \u201cThe premiums will range from 15-50%.

Only 2.17 lakh units have been constructed in the state against the target of 19 lakh affordable houses by 2020. This means more than 88% of the target is yet to be achieved. In 2018-19, the state government has constructed 1,892 units. In 2017-18 and 2016-17, it had built 55,695 and more than 1.6 lakh units respectively. The houses, meant for the economically weaker section, are constructed in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, in the PMR region in Pune and Shrirampur. \u201cThere was some delay in sanctioning of land last year. We will pick up the pace of construction now. We have recently launched a scheme at City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO),\u201d said housing officials, who plan to offer nearly 90,000 homes under the PMAY scheme. As per reports, in January this year, nearly 17,000 houses were approved for the urban poor by the urban development department. However, there was no deadline set. Unless adequate land is available for the project, completion will take time. Land availability is an issue especially in the big cities, said the the housing department official. The responsibility of land procurement is usually given to the Maharashtra Housing and Development Authority (MHADA), Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) and the local corporations. Under PMAY, the Centre provides assistance of Rs1lakh to Rs1.5lakh per dwelling, while the state contributes Rs1 lakh. The government allots the land at the rate of Re1 per sqmt with Rs1,000 charged as the stamp duty. The scheme has recently also involved developers under a PPP model. The state government has also waived the required security deposit for affordable housing meant for the economically weaker sections. There are other schemes like beneficiary-linked construction (BLC) and credit-linked subsidy scheme (CLSS) under which the state is trying to create affordable housing stock. Officials have, however, said there is also the issue of identifying genuine beneficiaries. Various agencies have been roped in to find the actual beneficiaries. Based on the demand for housing under the PMAY (Urban), the states/UTs formulate project proposals and they are approved by the state chief secretary. After that the proposal is submitted to the ministry for approval of Central assistance.

While the number of e-rickshaws in the city has increased, it is nowhere near what was expected,\u201d said a regional transport office (RTO) official. \u201cWe might think about giving it another try by asking the companies manufacturing the vehicles to come to the forefront. The timing is good as the Centre is talking about vehicles running on alternative fuel,\u201d the official added. In 2017, the Pune RTO had started e-rickshaw promotions. In August, it had finalized 14 routes on which the battery-operated vehicles would ply in Pune. But the figures have been dismal. \u201cTill now, only about 16 erickshaws have been registered with us. The numbers are a bit more encouraging got ecarts (around 80). People have remained uninterested even though the Central motor vehicles rules exempt e-rickshaws from taxes,\u201d another RTO official said. In the meantime, there has been a huge number of autorickshaw registrations. \u201cIn 2017-18, 9,387 autorickshaws were registered in Pune, and in 2018-19, as many as 16,044 were registered,\u201d the official told TOI. An industry source said more needs to be done. \u201cWe feel the autorickshaw unions did not let the e-rickshaws thrive. They dominate the market and have a lot of muscle power. Moreover, Pune RTO\u2019s decision to allow erickshaws to ply only on certain routes was wrong. The erickshaws should have been allowed to ply on all routes across the city. With the Pune Metro under construction, passengers will need last-mile connectivity \u2014 and it can be provided by the e-rickshaws. The corporations, MahaMetro and other agencies can still promote it. There is no reason for e-rickshaws not picking up in Pune but being a major hit in cities like Delhi and elsewhere,\u201d the source told TOI. An RTO official, however, said it was the primary responsibility of the companies to promote their vehicles. \u201cWe can do it once or twice. We had done an exhibition of e-vehicles on our premises early last year. The companies should promote their product by using different tactics. If they feel overpowered or threatened by the autorickshaw unions, they can come to us with specific complaints,\u201d he said. Abdul, who recently bought an e-cart and is into the delivery business, said he was happy with his decision. \u201cI used to do odd jobs before, but now, things have changed. I make decent earnings. I think people who are unemployed, or those who have small jobs, should get these vehicles. However, more help and support is required from the RTO and the state machinery,\u201d he said.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Nadda's appointment as working president was on the cards after he was not inducted into the government. Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Congratulations to him on becoming the working president of the party,\" the Prime Minister added. Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president.

Over 30,000 domicile, caste, income and non-creamy layer certificates are to be issued by over 100 Maha-e-seva kendras and citizen facilitation centres (CFCs) in the district ahead of the admission season. These certificates are important for admission to educational institutes as well as for government jobs. Though people were allowed to apply for these certificates online last year, a huge last-minute rush of parents and students has left the collectorate officials baffled. \u201cEven as the online application facility is open, citizens prefer to queue up for last-minute requirements, putting immense pressure on the staff and pushing up pendency,\u2019\u2019 tehsildar Prashant Awate, who oversees the issuing of these certificates, told TOI. Presently, there are over 150 Maha-e-seva kendras , three Setu Centres and 46 CFCs, excluding the one at the railway station ST bus stand, are toiling hard to issue these certificates. \u201cParents, mainly from the rural areas, do not apply online.

With the new academic year fast nearing, many students are applying for income and caste certificates, to apply for government scholarships, reservation and other benefits.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

By the time both the teams shook hands in Manchester, India had beaten Pakistan in each of the seven times they met in World Cups. And fans came out in force to celebrate. The stretch of Fergusson College Road, near Dnyaneshwar Paduka Chowk, was chock-a-block with jubilant fans. Drummers dished out a pulsating rhythm as revellers relished the Men in Blue\u2019s performance. For many families in the city, it was an evening filled with entertainment. When all-rounder Hardik Pandya bowled a full toss to Pakistan\u2019s Babar Azam, who dispatched it for four, the Nigavekars gasped. Their youngest son, Jay (9), was decked up in Indian colours as the family were glued to the television. \u201cMy son and daughter are crazy about the game, so they\u2019re completely into the match right now,\u201d said Pallavi. The mood in the city was upbeat, with fans setting off fireworks as early as 8.30pm in the Deccan area, as people got ready to celebrate India\u2019s imminent victory. \u201cI\u2019m super excited. I\u2019m so pumped up,\u201d young Jay said. \u201cIt\u2019s doubly special ... it\u2019s also Father\u2019s Day,\u201d the nine-year-old added. His father Kedar, a health care professional based in Mumbai, agreed it was a special occasion. \u201cMy son is a big cricket fan \u2014 he wears the Indian team jersey every day ... It\u2019s been crazy!\u201d Kedar said. The mood was electric at eateries and malls across the city, which organized live screenings of the match. Rahul Kusale, manager of Vimannagar-based Playoffs Sports Lounge, said they had a full house. \u201cWe attracted a very good crowd,\u201d Kusale said, adding that it was great to see that the audience watching the match with complete thrill. \u201cThe way they react collectively is something else. There were loud cheers for boundaries and sixes. The fans were egging the team on with a lot of enthusiasm,\u201d Kusale said. Nanded-based Priyanka Vyas (25), who stays on Senapati Bapat Road, made a beeline for the nearest mall with her friend Achint Kaur, an IT professional, for live screening alongside multitudes of fans. \u201cAround 200 people turned up to watch the game on the big screen,\u201d Vyas said. However, the constant rain interruptions cast a pall of gloom over the match. \u201cOn the one hand, I was disappointed that the rain kept interfering with the match, but on the other, I was happy that India won,\u201d Prashant Gaikwad (22), an engineering student, said. \u201cOur initial expectation was that India would win fair and square, and though that happened, it was annoying because of the rain,\u201d Gaikwad said. \u201cI\u2019m at my aunt\u2019s place and I could hear loud cheers from the entire building,\u201d he said. However, the roads congested with celebrating fans were a reason to frown, for some. Arya Bhavnani (34), who stays in Bavdhan, couldn\u2019t wait to get home. \u201cI\u2019m happy that we won, but it\u2019s annoying that this stretch always gets congested on such occasions,\u201d Bhavnani said.

The villages include Lohegaon, Mundhwa, Sadesatranali, Shivne, Uttamnagar, Ambegaon Khurd, Undri, Dhayri, Ambegaon Budruk, Phursungi and Uruli Devachi Despite a severe mosquito menace, health authorities of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) have yet to initiate measures to check the spread , many residents said. The landscape of these 11 merged villages which are already crumbling under poor infrastructure is dotted with half complete or ongoing construction sites where water stagnation is a fitting ground for mosquito breeding. All these villages have witnessed a significant growth in population and commercial activities in the last few years. However, water scarcity in these areas continues to be erratic prompting storage which also provides for the mosquitoes to breed. \u201cIt has been almost two years that 11 fringe areas and villages were merged with the PMC.

People living along the Mula river in Kehavnagar, Mundhwa and Manjari are badly affected by mosquitoes owing to rampant growth of water hyacinth.\u201d The rampant growth of water hyacinth in the Mula and Mutha rivers is the reason for swarms of mosquitoes that invade housing societies posing a serious threat of mosquito-borne diseases. \u201cThe rampant growth of hyacinth in the Mula river is the cause for mosquito breeding.

The idea was born out of a personal experience of a colleague who had to run from pillar to post, after her husband -- the key decision maker in the household -- was rendered immobile after an accident. The data that a user provides on the app is encrypted for security, and the user can decide when to transmit the data to the next of kin. \"Investment Safeguard encrypts the user\u2019s investment details before transferring it to the application servers. So, nobody except the user and the appointees (when required) have access to the investment details,\" the company said in a statement. This, however, is no substitute for a will, which is a legal document and continues to be the best way to ring fence your family in event of any unfortunate event. \"Yes, will remains the most legal way to transfer assets but many a times in absence of a will, the next of kin do not know what they are left with.

In case, the user\u2019s family does not know of the declaration on the app or have not been authorised to log-in, the company has factored in ways to deal with the situation. \u201cWith Investment Safeguard, the user gets periodic reminders to revisit the investment records and ensure that details are up-to-date. It gives the user an option to set the notification reminder either once every month or once every two months or once in three months, based on their convenience. In case the user fails to respond to the notification, the support team will reach out to the user first, and subsequently to the beneficiaries,\u201d the company said.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

A new government resolution (GR) was issued this month following rising complaints about officials not attending to citizens properly. The GR iterates that the government officials must maintain strict adherence to the timing. All employees from a department cannot go for lunch at the same time. The June 4 circular stated, \u201cOffice heads should ensure that officers/staffers will not take more time (than the stipulated 30 minutes) for lunch and that all the officers/staffers in a branch do not go for lunch at the same time.\u201d According to the circular, the slot has been fixed in view of complaints that officers and staffers stay away from their desks for long citing lunch break, leaving citizens waiting in queues. Worse, many officials excuse themselves for meetings soon after returning to their desks. The heads of departments have been directed to implement the new order and take disciplinary action against those absent after the stipulated lunch interval without permission, stated an official. Fixed lunch interval was one of the recommendations of the high-level reorganization committee appointed by the government. Some other recommendations, including reduction in the number of holidays in a year, were implemented earlier. Citizens want the 30-minute lunch break to be implemented in the state government offices strictly. The programme director of Parisar, an environmental organization, Ranjit Gadgil, told TOI that the move was good, but it should be implemented properly. \u201cThe officers have to adhere to these norms and citizens should not be made to wait and suffer,\u201d he said. Activist Vihar Durve himself had to wait for long at Mantralaya earlier because of the \u201cextended lunch\u201d of officials. Hailing the decrease in the lunch break timing, he said the focus should be on concerted effort to clear the files at the earliest. \u201cThere is no point in just reducing the lunch time if they delay the process of clearing files or refuse to meet citizens,\u201d he added. In September 2001, the state government had fixed half-an-hour slot between 1pm and 2pm for its officials at Mantralaya (state secretariat) in Mumbai.

Even at ATM kiosks \u2014 some of which were guarded while a few were not \u2014 the security personnel did not have weapons to fend of criminals. The reason: No weapons were provided by the agencies that had employed them. Friday\u2019s robbery in Nashik, when an employee of Muthoot Finance was gunned down for raising an alarm, is a stark reminder of how vulnerable our financial institutions are. As an immediate reaction, the police there urged the banks to deploy armed guards, perhaps without realising that there are too many rules that prohibit such a deployment. \u201cEvery time there is an attack, the police tell the banks to strengthen the security measures, which we do by placing more cameras, increasing surveillance etc. However, even if we arm the guards, do you think that a single guard can take on six criminals, as was the case on Friday? The question that needs answering is: \u2018How did the dacoits get these weapons?\u2019,\u201d said a top security officer of a public sector bank. \u201cIt is the police\u2019s responsibility to act. It is unfair to put all the responsibilities on banks,\u201d he added. As per the latest data, Pune district has half its sanctioned strength of about 23,000 policemen. Moreover, a majority of the police personnel are not authorised to carry a weapon. \u201cWhen the policemen themselves do not carry weapons, how do you expect us to?\u201d asked Ashish Sharma, a private security guard deployed at a co-operative bank. \u201cThis is not a secure job,\u201d said Tikaram Gupta, another guard, on being asked if he felt threatened. Talking of how the guards are expected to deal with Nashik-type incidents, Gupta said, \u201cOur agency has asked us to step away from the scene if there is any untoward incident and report to the head office and the police. We are not supposed to get involved.\u201d Over a dozen security guards TOI spoke to said they often get half the wages that the banks pay to the agencies that employ them \u2014 hardly an incentive to put themselves in the harm\u2019s way.

Once in a while, the police visit to check if the cameras are in order and we comply with the police suggestions if any, he added. \u201cThe problem in arming the guards is that the agency must first take a commercial arms licence. Some agencies have applied for the licences, but the approvals are pending for too long,\u201d said the security officer quoted above.
