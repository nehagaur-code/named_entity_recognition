At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "\nVic and Vini get buzzing at Output Bengaluru\n": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vic-and-vini-get-buzzing-at-output-bengaluru/articleshow/68863753.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Garbage menace at Pulakeshinagar.": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/garbagemenaceatpulakeshinagar-/articleshow/69641640.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Bengaluru: Senior citizens urge riders to not use footpath, obey traffic laws": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//videos/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-senior-citizens-urge-riders-to-not-use-footpath-obey-traffic-laws/videoshow/69774680.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Satta Matka 2018": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/agra-court-rejects-satta-king-shyam-vohra-bail-plea/articleshow/65506776.cms", "time": "", "description": "AGRA: Shyam Vohra, known as 'satta king' of the Taj city, was denied bail by district court of Agra.

The attribution for the image notes that it was taken from the website of the Indian Navy. No photographer\u2019s name is given. The war, for all intents and purposes was over. Photographers from news agencies and publications from around the world descended on Dhaka \u2013 or Dacca, as it was then called. But the Indian Government had its own photographers to record the war, and Bengaluru-born Sreenivas Kumar was one of them. The 83-year-old became interested in photography when he was young, and he left Bangalore for Bombay in 1958, to do a cinematography course with a film studio. He pursued a freelance career for a while, before taking up a job with the Films Division of India in 1961. In 1968, he answered an advertisement looking for a photographic officer at the Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity (DAVP), and got the job. \u201cThe job was based in Delhi, and I spent a few years covering various national events,\u201d he says. Then, the war happened. He was transferred to the DAVP\u2019s Defence Wing, and was assigned to cover the war. \u201cThere were not many volunteers to cover the war,\u201d he says, laughing at the memory. \u201cBut I was keen to do it. I was issued two Nikon F2 cameras \u2013 the latest model \u2013 by the department, and then, I boarded a military transport plane that took me to Calcutta. From Calcutta, we travelled by road to Teliamura in Tripura,\u201d he says. Kumar, then 35, joined a team of four including a cameraman from the Films Division and a reporter from All India Radio and left Delhi on December 1, 1971. Kumar took a couple of dozen rolls of film with him. \u201cBack in those days, Japanese brands were not allowed in India. We had to make do with film rolls from the Soviet Union. We used NP 22 for slow shutter speed photos and NP 27 for fast clicks,\u201d he says. The team members were given Army officer ranks and wore uniforms \u2013 as per law \u2013 to begin work from the front. \u201cWe were stationed in a camp in Teliamura where I met members of the Mukti Bahini, armed guerrillas, fighters for Bangladesh liberation. I got some good shots of them in the jungles before we began on our hurried road journey to Agartala from where news of heavy Pakistani shelling was coming in,\u201d Kumar recalls. Initially, there wasn\u2019t too much problem with getting film. But then, heavy shelling by Pakistani forces made air travel between Delhi and Calcutta difficult, and getting additional rolls of film was hardly a high priority. \u201cI used to borrow film from other photographers, and was lucky enough to be able to get rolls of film whenever I visited Calcutta,\u201d he says. The procedure was that Kumar would take pictures and they would be sent to Delhi. \u201cThe Government and the army were responsible for developing the snaps, and it would be a long time before I could even see the photographs I had taken,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile some of the black and white photos from the frontline made it to the newspapers and magazines, I maintained a personal collection of hundreds of rejected images of the war. And some are rare photographs of the conflict and surrender,\u201d says the octogenarian, who retired from service in 1985.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted.

Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time.

KSNDMC director GS Srinivasa Reddy said the present picture is a complete contrast of the previous year\u2019s situation, when some of the reservoirs were full. \u201cLast year, we received ample rain in May itself. Some dams like Kabini were full by this time. This time, the effect of Cyclone Vayu has further delayed the monsoon. Though rain is expected in a few days, it will take another month to see more inflow into reservoirs,\u201d he added. A senior official from KSNDMC explained that the initial weeks of June usually see a lull, though last year was an exception. \u201cRain should have started by the second week at least. Delayed filling of dams will have an impact on agriculture and hydro power generation. More importantly, it will have a cascading effect on drinking water availability next summer,\u201d he added. Among the 13 reservoirs, only Supa and Narayanapura have comparatively good live storage at 30%. Even in dams of the Cauvery basin, the levels are between 10% and 14%. Weathermen have predicted rain or thundershowers at a few places in coastal Karnataka and at isolated places in interior Karnataka for the next few days. \u201cOn Sunday too, most parts of coastal Karnataka and some of south Karnataka received showers. However, dry weather prevailed in north interior Karnataka. Dakshina Kannada, Uppinangadi and Chikkamagaluru got heavy rain,\u201d said an official from Meteorological Centre, Bengaluru.

The move comes against the backdrop of the IMA Group cheating thousands of investors of crores of rupees. Revenue minister RV Deshpande told TOI that the government is contemplating new legislation for Ponzi schemes that will involve fast-track courts to ensure speedy trials. \u201cWe have realised that there are certain loopholes in the system that have to be plugged,\u201d Deshpande said. \u201cFast-track courts for Ponzi cases are among various reforms we are considering.\u201d The IMA Group scam surfaced last week after an audio clip surfaced of its founder-owner, Mohammed Mansoor Khan, threatening to commit suicide. That led to thousands of depositors lodging police complaints against the firm. The case has posed new challenges to investigators. Among them, the firm claimed to be a limited liability partnership in which profits are subject to market risks, precluding police from taking action against it under the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments (KPID) Act, 2004. Officials contemplating the new legislation said the department of parliamentary affairs is studying the issue and a bill for the new law is likely to be introduced during the monsoon session of the assembly. Home minister MB Patil said the government wanted to give investigating agencies more teeth. \u201cPolice currently cannot confiscate the assets of a Ponzi company even if there is a case,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a procedure to be followed through the revenue department. In the new system, police will have the power to seize properties.\u201d He said the government will create a common platform comprising representatives of the police, revenue, income tax and commercial tax departments to deal with cases related to Ponzi schemes. In the absence of such an arrangement, cases have not progressed and depositors have been left without restitution years after cases were filed. For instance, in the ViniVinc case, an early Ponzi company that unravelled in 2005, only a handful of depositors retrieved their money. In the Ambidant case of last year, 1,700 complainants with claims totalling Rs 600 crore are yet to get back their money as the matter is entangled in legal and procedural quagmires. Government sources said around 17 Ponzi companies are currently facing trial. The government recently took back the power to seize assets that it had handed to the competent authority \u2014 the assistant commissioner of revenue. Principal secretary, revenue, Rajkumar Khatri said steps are being taken to restore the power of the assistant commissioner to confiscate assets. LC Nagaraj, assistant commissioner, revenue, Bangalore north subdivision, said the special investigation team (SIT) has identified movable assets including gold jewellery in in the IMA case and on Monday started the process to seize them. \u201cIt takes time to initiate the process to seize immovable properties of the IMA Group as the government is yet to restore our power to do so,\u201d Nagaraj said. While police earlier said it could not invoke the KPID Act against IMA, Nagaraj said they now could as the department had received complaints from people claiming that they had deposited money with the firm and Mansoor Khan is now on the run.

This, despite the CM sending a letter of appeasement along with an emissary in the form of his cabinet colleague and animal husbandry minister Venkatrao Nadagouda to the BJP camp.

Early on Sunday morning, as BJP leaders led by party state president BS Yeddyurappa were preparing to gherao the CM\u2019s home office, the JD(S)-Congress coalition government made a pre-emptive effort to checkmate the opposition by sending Nadagouda along with a letter from the CM. While Nadagouda did not stay more than 30 seconds, suggesting that it was only a political move by the coalition to disrupt the BJP\u2019s plans, the letter stated Kumaraswamy was open to parleys over the land deal, IMA scam and other concerns of the opposition. \u201cThe government has taken all possible drought-mitigation measures and successfully implemented the farm loan waiver.

However, they were all forced to vacate the premises. The leaders were taken to Cubbon Park and released in half an hour.

The duo, Abu and Mohammed, are in their mid-20s and belong to Kerala. They were running the India-Qatar drug smuggling ring with Bengaluru as the base. Drugs, including hashish and methamphetamine, were recovered from their hideout in Austin Town. The total value of the seizure is around Rs 3 crore.

The hashish and methamphetamine are estimated to be worth over Rs 20 lakh in the international market. The six arrested persons were remanded in judicial custody on Monday. Further probe is under way. Box: Kingpin was a carrier in Qatar A drug carrier himself three years ago, Abu returned to India from Qatar last year. He settled in Bengaluru with his aide Mohammed and started sourcing methamphetamine and other drugs from Mumbai, Delhi and Goa. The two procured hashish from Kerala. \u201cThey used to send mules across India to bring drugs to Bengaluru and recruit carriers to fly with the contraband, mainly from KIA and occasionally from Mangaluru and Kochi airports. They had been running the cartel for a year,\u201d another investigator said.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

The navtar, according to Vishnu, is a combination of Indian traditional and Western instruments which lets one play classical and Carnatic songs as well as Western jazz and oriental music. The instrument is trademarked and is awaiting patent. \u201cThough it may appear like a traditional guitar, a closer look at it will reveal a variety of design changes and modifications. For example, the most important distinction is that it has nine strings (hence, nav-tar. Nav also means unique in Sanskrit), six of which are fretted and tuned like a guitar and three additional playing strings on a fretless board, designed and tuned differently to suit Indian classical music. The sound of it is best described as a combination of a sarod, sitar and guitar. Some have even said that it offers a totally different, new sound altogether,\u201d said Vishnu, while describing the instrument, which he got custom-made from a guitar maker in Auroville, Puducherry. While delivering a talk on \u2018Innovation and Tradition\u2019 at IME, on Sunday, Vishnu pointed out how the invention stemmed from a desire to combine two of his interests \u2014 Indian classical and Western music. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important for an artist to delve deep into an art form, to it\u2019s very source, and bring out the essence and beauty of it to the listeners, while maintaining an original voice/signature of his own,\u201d said Vishnu. \u201cThere are many ideas and refinements in design I\u2019d like to execute, after which it would be a great honour for me to have the navtar housed at the IME,\u201d he said.

Revealing this in an interview with TOI, Deshpande, however, denied that he had done Khan any undue favour. TOI had on Friday reported that a Muslim politician had taken Khan to a minister to enable him to get a clean chit for his company\u2019s operations, but a senior IAS officer declined to issue the certificate despite pressure from the minister. Deshpande said it was the police department which had given IMA a clean chit after the RBI insisted that the firm\u2019s deals be looked into. Why were you particular about giving a clean chit to IMA when it was in financial distress and Mohammed Mansoor Khan was desperately trying raise funds through a bank loan?It was not me or the revenue department that gave a clean chit to IMA. Police submitted a report that the activities of the company did not attract action under provisions of the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments (KPID) Act and said there was no case against it. We only wanted to hear from the law department about the company as it was still under the RBI scanner. Did Khan meet you in person seeking help...?Khan met me last month. I cannot deny this fact. But I didn\u2019t do him any undue favour. Khan came to meet me with Baig. Baig said Khan was from his constituency and was of good character. I clearly told Baig that we would only do whatever we were allowed to do within the legal framework. But these developments give scope for doubt that the revenue department went out of its way to help the IMA Group...As I said earlier, the government did not do anything outside the legal framework. While the police department reported that the activities of IMA did not attract provisions of the KPID Act as it was not collecting deposits from the public, the RBI wanted to reinvestigate. I told my principal secretary Rajkumar Khatri to follow the laid-down procedure. He sent the file to the law department. There are allegations that pressure was exerted on officials...I am not one to hide anything. I hadn\u2019t even seen the file before Khatri sent it to the law department.

I am so transparent that I invite you to see the file and learn about its movement from the revenue department to the law department and back to the revenue department.

Well, you take your own vehicles, mostly two-wheelers, and head out. But then comes the next hurdle. Where do you park? With no space earmarked for students to park their vehicles inside campus, most are compelled to hunt for spots in the neighbourhood, which in turn inconveniences residents of the area. With traffic cops cracking the whip on students parking near college, many end up missing class in their search for an appropriate spot, or pay hefty fines for violating rules. Educational institutions like Mount Carmel College, Jyothi Nivas College and Sri Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain College are a few city colleges that offer no parking solutions for students using their own means of transport. Safety of vehicles an issue\u201cOne day, I had parked my scooter close to the boundary wall of a house near my college. On my return, I saw that they had scribbled \u2018Do Not Park Here\u2019 on the seat. Thankfully, it was with chalk, though,\u201d says Bindu Menon*, a student of Mount Carmel College. The lack of parking area means that students leave their two-wheelers and four-wheelers by the roadside close to college. For students who live far, this translates into leaving early from home to get a parking spot near college. And their woes don\u2019t end here. Roadside parking often leads to quarrels with residents of the area, as well as fines paid to traffic cops. Radhika Suman* from Jyoti Nivas College rues, \u201cOur college has limited parking space. By the time we reach in the morning, the nearby lanes are almost full, considering that there are a lot of offices and eateries in the vicinity. Even if we do manage to find parking space, there is no guarantee on the safety of our vehicles and we often come back to see punctured tyres, scratches and dents. Sometimes, our vehicles are towed away by traffic cops, which are released only after we cough up the fine.\u201d Colleges claim they are helping studentsCollege authorities, meanwhile, say they are doing their best to help students with parking space. \u201cThis year, senior students will be allowed to park their vehicles in the ground near college, that is otherwise used for all sports activities. Freshers are encouraged to use public transport or carpool,\u201d says Jency Jose, student welfare officer at Mount Carmel College. Jency adds that even though the administration regularly informs students not to bring their own vehicles, they continue to do so. \u201cWe have also told students not to park their vehicles in the lanes nearby, as it inconveniences residents,\u201d she adds. Anila Thomas, lecturer at Jyoti Nivas College , says that though there is enough space for students to park, sometimes due to construction work, there are difficulties. \u201cThere is enough space for students, but because there is construction work going on, we sometimes have a problem. The students too are adjusting with the parking space that is available to them now. But this is just temporary, if students have an issue they can always approach us,\u201d says Anila.

He said the coalition government has taken steps to unearth the truth by forming a Special Investigation Team. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough. It should provide justice to investors. Victims of many such past cases are waiting even now,\u201d he said in an open letter to Kumaraswamy. He said the chief minister should personally monitor the case by appointing an ombudsman and set up a special court to try scams, like the IMA one, to ensure legal procedures are completed at the earliest. Patil said the government should try these cases under the new ordinance (Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Ordinance, 2019) promulgated by the Centre in February to curb Ponzi schemes and protect small investors. It\u2019s valid till August and may become an Act in the upcoming Parliament session. It allows a special court to complete legal procedures of attachment, realisation and distribution of proceeds to depositors within 180 days from the date of filing an application by a competent authority. It also targets black money or unaccounted-for funds which get converted into legitimate assets. He added that it would prevent gullible investors from getting fleeced and also plug many gaps in current laws. It not only helps depositors but also the government in limiting conversion of black money into white.

The grenade exploded outside the headquarters. No casualties have been reported. The first attack happened on Monday morning when a team of security men was on a cordon-and-search operation in Achabal. Terrorists fired at the team, who then retaliated. In the Pulwama attack, the terrorists after setting off the IED, opened fire at the Army vehicle. \"Initial reports reveal the vehicle suffered extensive damage,\" the official said.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister said an active and effective opposition is a necessity in a democracy and pointed out that a well- argued and factual criticism of the government strengthens democracy. \"Sometimes such positive contributions are not noticed as they do not get high TRPs,\" he said. Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said. Referring to his recent speeches, the Prime Minister said that \"we started with ' sab ka saath, sab ka vikas', but the people have added an unprecedented 'vishwas' (trust) to the matter\".

Sources said Metro\u2019s Gottigere-Nagawara, RV Road-Bommasandra, Silk Board-KR Puram and KR Puram- Kempegowda International Airport lines are likely to be delayed if GAIL Gas and Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) don\u2019t resolve the issues. On Gottigere-Nagawara corridor, for instance, GAIL Gas\u2019s eight-inch steel pipeline is close to the proposed underground Pottery Town Metro station. BMRCL along with GAIL Gas recently conducted a joint site visit at Pottery Town. GAIL Gas has now agreed to shift the pipeline about 200m away. At Silk Board junction, where an interchange station of RV Road-Bommasandra and Silk Board-KR Puram lines is planned, about 200 metres of steel pipeline has to be relocated. Separately, GAIL Gas has asked BMRCL to realign 700 metres of Metro line of the Silk Board-Agara Lake stretch on Outer Ring Road to avoid shifting of GAIL Gas\u2019s pipeline, which is now under the discussion stage. Sources said BMRCL is unlikely to change the alignment as it may have to acquire additional properties. However, at some locations, GAIL Gas has already realigned its proposed pipeline during execution stage based on the modifications suggested by BMRCL. In fact, GAIL Gas shifted 2km of an eight-inch gas pipeline from Jayadeva Hospital-Sony World signal to accommodate Metro alignment. Further, about 1.3km of pipeline was rerouted in Yelahanka as per BMRCL recommendations. On ITPL Main Road, GAIL Gas officials said they shifted operational MDPE network carrying natural gas in two places and relocation of operational steel network is in progress at two other locations. \u201cOn the same ITPL Road the steel network (uncharged) was shifted at two locations in the construction phase itself,\u201d said a GAIL Gas official. \u201cWhen natural gas pipelines are laid by open trench method, the depth is 1-2 metres from ground level and may vary depending on the presence of other utilities like drains, water pipelines and electric cables. When pipelines are laid by trenchless (HDD method), the depth varies from 2 to 8m,\u201d said a GAIL Gas spokesperson. Asked if it\u2019s possible to relocate pipelines, an official said: \u201cGAIL Gas is laying steel & MDPE pipeline networks. So, shifting of charged gas pipelines is the last option as gas supply to customers will be affected. There are also safety concerns. The relocation of steel network can be taken up only when there is no other alternative.\u201d \u201cWe are coordinating to resolve issues related to natural gas pipelines and Metro work. We\u2019ll soon resolve these issues to meet the Phase 2 deadline. We\u2019re also conducting a joint survey with GAIL Gas for new Metro lines so that necessary modifications can be implemented during the design stage itself,\u201d said a BMRCL official. LESSONS FROM PAST DAMAGE GAIL officials said two instances of damages to gas pipelines due to Metro work have been reported on ITPL Road. Sources said after the damage to a gas pipeline on ITPL Road in October 2018, a coordination meeting was held between GAIL and BMRCL officials to discuss ways to avoid such incidents. Both agencies decided to share alignment details of the proposed and ongoing work and map the utilities along Metro alignment and take precautionary measure. All Metro work was suspended for a week and joint site visits were conducted to identify vulnerable areas. BMRCL resumed work post joint site visit. BMRCL had changed Namma Metro route to KIA via Hebbal after the line proposed earlier \u2014 which runs via Ramakrishna Hegde Nagar, Nagawara and Jakkur \u2014 was too close to Bengaluru-Mangaluru Oil pipeline. All Saints\u2019 Church protests against BMRCL Residents, activists and members of All Saints' Church protested for the fourth time, inside the All Saints' Church in Ashoknagar against the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) which is acquiring the church\u2019s 4,500sqm of land for Metro work. Activists claimed the project is against the BMRCL\u2019s DPR (detailed project planning). \u201cOver 150 trees belonging to 13 different species will have to be cut for the construction,\u201d said Jiben Vijaya of All Saints'. The protesters want the proposed Metro station at the spot needs to be moved 25 metres to the left to avoid damage to the environment. TIMES VIEW There\u2019s no end in sight to the woes of Namma Metro. The latest is the possible clash of GAIL pipelines with the Metro sections of upcoming lines. It\u2019s time these companies sat down to resolve the issue at the earliest. There have been too many delays in Metro construction and this has resulted in massive cost escalation. The huge popularity of the two Metro lines among commuters is an indicator of how badly the city needs this mass transport system. We need more lines and better connectivity to all areas so that people can move seamlessly across the city.

The civic agency has failed to keep its side of the bargain and provide its project partners decent school buildings and spruce up classrooms by freshly painting them. TimesViewIt envisioned lighting up the lives of thousands of students by bringing them on a par with their private school counterparts in terms of exposure and facilities. However, Project Roshni is far from fulfilling its objectives, thanks to the indolence of civic authorities. The poll code may have been a hindrance but the excuse doesn't pass muster as the agency had ample time to spruce up classrooms since September when the scheme was officially launched. Nevertheless, with the code having been lifted, the Palike should do the needful so that its project partners can give schools a much-needed smart makeover.The Rs 500-crore project, which was to take off this academic year, had envisaged bringing digital TVs, tablets, augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and machine learning into BBMP classrooms, apart from enhancing teachers\u2019 skills and encouraging community involvement. Mostly funded by Microsoft, which had announced it would share its software free of cost with students of BBMP schools and colleges, the project will now have to wait for another year to see the light of day. There are 155 schools and colleges run by BBMP. BBMP chief N Manjunatha Prasad said the civic body was not able to furnish painted classrooms or improve infrastructure in schools, a move which could have benefited thousands of students. \u201cThe agency couldn\u2019t take up the work as the model code of conduct for the Lok Sabha polls was in force till recently,\u2019 he explained, adding: \u201cHowever, we will paint and repair the schools and hand over them over to the project partnets by July 31.\u201d However Tech Avant-Garde CEO Ali Sait asserted they are keen on executing Project Roshni in BBMP schools but expressed helplessness as the civic administration had failed to provide better infrastructure for digital education. \u201cWe had only requested them to repaint and restructure the schools as we can\u2019t proceed without basic infrastructure,\u201dAli said, adding: \u201cOnce BBMP hands over the renovated schools to us, we will take less than two months to finish the digital education setup.\u201d BBMP education standing committee chairman Imran Pasha said Tech Avant-Garde could have executed the required work on its own as the civic officials\u2019 hands were tied by the poll code and they were also busy with election work. However, Sait said they couldn\u2019t execute any kind of development work on school premises. \u201cAs an agency, we didn\u2019t have any work order.

Companies like Bounce, Yulu, Vogo and Drivezy, who are in the business, say offenders are getting away despite promises by civic authorities and police.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

It has also become popular for is a platform for young talented individuals. Taking a cue from travel and food bloggers, many Make-up Artists (MUAs) have started using Instagram to showcase their work in the last few months. The Personal Touch For 28-year-old Vaishnavi, who is a product designer and manager at healthcare start-up, being an MUA came about by chance. But creating a personalised Insta page for her work as an MUA was a choice Vaishnavi is glad she made. Though there is an option to start a business handle, Vaishnavi chose to post her work as MUA along with her personal posts. \u201cI got more positive responses because of this, because people could see a face and a person behind the work. The personal touch with posts from my everyday life with my work gave it a human touch,\u201d Vaishnavi explains. \u201cPeople will go \u2018oh! I know what this person is like. I can trust her\u2019 because they see me doing things beyond make-up,\u201d she adds. She reduced the number of posts on her business page \u2018Pumpkin Chariot\u2019 after finding greater engagement with her personal profile. Vaishnavi began styling people as a hobby and as a result of increasing demand, also started providing make-up services to strangers who then became her clients. Now, she is taking it a step further by giving services shaped by her personal experiences. \u201cI wanted to instil in my clients a feeling of self-love and confidence which I attained after lots of ups and downs. People say that social media can be depressing. But I am utilising Instagram to bring together my personal experiences and professional expertise to help people,\u201d Vaishnavi says. According to Vaishnavi, Instagram has also given MUAs a lot of respect and they are seen as more than just \u2018Parlour persons\u2019. \u201cNow the whole concept has changed because of big brands and collaborations on Insta. Now we are artists who are also called \u2018influencers.\u2019 It is a big step for this field,\u201d she says. Posting an ambition For 25-year-old Roshni Mubeen, Instagram was much more than just a social media platform to stay in touch with her friends. For the young software engineer, Instagram proved to be the platform to fulfil her dream of becoming a popular MUA. \u201cOn Instagram, it is easier for people to see your work through pictures and videos. It\u2019s also much easier to interact with your audience,\u201d Roshni says. She quit her job last year, after working for nearly four years and started as an MUA on Instagram (with the handle ShineWithShadesByRoshni) from January. \u201cI enrolled for a course to hone my skills. In addition, Instagram has helped me gain a lot of clients. Bridal make-up and modelling shoots are some assignments that come my way,\u201d she says. Roshni has gained 1,500 followers in the past five months on Instagram. She attributes the growth to word of mouth as well as the platform\u2019s algorithms. \u201cInsta highlights people\u2019s interests and shows them what they like,\u201d Roshni explains. The young MUA had to endure a lot of difficulties to get here. Her family was initially sceptical about make-up as a profession and Instagram as a platform, she says. They\u2019ve changed their minds now. \u201cFrom appreciation to a supportive community, I have found it all on Insta. I have even made some really good friends thanks to Instagram,\u201d Roshni says who plans to start her own make-up academy in the future. Connecting with young people Fiza Khan quit her job and took a year\u2019s break before starting her own page as an MUA in October. After choosing a unique name (maquillage_by_fiza, where Maquillage is make-up in French), she began by trying to establish a strong foothold on Instagram and it has paid off in the past few months. \u201cThere are so many talented artists on Instagram who were inspirations to me. There is, of course, Huda Beauty, then Tamanna Roshan, Leena Bhushan and so many more who inspire new MUA like me to explore Instagram and use it to reach a greater number of audiences,\u201d 27-year-old Fiza says. What started as inviting friends to home, doing their make-up and posting pictures on Instagram, has turned into collaborations with models and assignments for bridal and party make-up. Fiza says Instagram provides several opportunities, but one cannot take it for granted. \u201cOn Insta, it is out of sight and out of mind. One must consistently post and engage with your audience to keep the spark alive. If you are doing it all right, nothing like it,\u201d she says. She plans to start a website but will always keep Instagram as the primary source to stay engaged with her clients. It\u2019s you need For Saba Khan, a mother of two, Instagram turned out to be the platform which reignited her passion after almost five years. Saba used to work as an Events Producer for corporates, also doing a six-month stint in Shanghai. But after her marriage in 2013 and motherhood, she went with the flow and kept her career on hold. \u201cBetween all this, I did not forget my passion for make-up. I had always wanted to pursue something in it,\u201d 31-year-old Saba says. She then decided to attend a course in make-up and started her page (Makeup by Saba Khan) on Instagram in September 2018. \u201cIt has been an organic growth on the platform, and I am doing really well with a lot of regular clients. Instagram is the best platform to kick-start your business,\u201d Saba says. Like Vaishnavi, Saba also says that Instagram has helped to get rid of the stigma attached to make-up artists. \u201cThey were not seen as artists earlier. Now, there are no tags and there is an obvious change in the attitude of people,\u201d she says. Saba says her USP is providing realistic make-up to enhance her clients\u2019 beauty. \u201cOften it is people who don\u2019t regularly wear make-up who visit MUAs. I specialise in not going overboard and that\u2019s what people like,\u201d She says, adding that the feedback on Instagram on this has helped her to make it her trademark. \u201cOne won\u2019t get a chance to interact with their clients like that on a website. I don\u2019t think one needs a website if you have a page on Insta. A good promotion and social media marketing are the only things required in this age,\u201d Saba adds.

While parking has been banned on MG Road, there\u2019s already a restriction on Church Street. With no designated parking space available nearby, visitors and shop keepers are facing inconvenience. Traffic cops had initially imposed parking ban on Brigade Road too, but it was lifted after the Brigade Road Shops and Establishments Association raised objection. However, slots available there are limited. Sohail Yusuf, secretary of the association, said these traffic curbs will have a negative impact on business activities. \u201cShoppers and visitors to commercial hubs need certain amount of ease. But that\u2019s missing now. Metro work is important, but there should have been shorter routes to reach these spots; commuters are forced to take a detour now. On Brigade Road, we\u2019ve 85 parking slots for four-wheelers and it is used by 1,300 vehicles daily,\u201d he added. \u2018Leave a portion of Kamaraj Road open\u2019Bhoopalam P Srinath, president, Bangalore Traders Association, told TOI that there was no need to ban parking on MG Road. \u201cCivic agencies take their own time to finish projects. MG Road-Byappanahalli Metro work took around seven years instead of the scheduled three years. Many visitors said they had to do multiple rounds in the central business district (CBD) to park their vehicles and come to MG Road. There are over 200 commercial establishments and office spaces on the stretch between Brigade Junction and Anil Kumble Circle itself. The authorities should have made some alternative arrangements, either by temporarily acquiring properties adjacent to Kamaraj Road and allowing vehicles along a portion of the stretch itself,\u201d he added. Deepak Batavia, president, Church Street Occupants\u2019 Association, said they are yet to recover from the losses they have incurred during the redevelopment of Church Street. \u201cUnlike Commercial Street or other hubs, there are a lot of eateries on Church Street. People prefer to drive in with families and friends to eat and drink. Despite having slots, parking has been prohibited here since more than a year,\u201d he added. He said a memorandum will be submitted to the government requesting not to ban vehicles on the street. Running around for parkingWith a segment of Kamaraj Road shut, reaching MG Road and adjacent areas has become a Herculean task for commuters. And for those who arrive there finally, have to run around to find a parking space. Pranam R, a banker, said the authorities should have opened Church Street for parking where slots are available after the TenderSURE makeover. The interchange hub, which BMRCL has taken up now, is expected to be ready only by 2023.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination. His late grandfather, Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, was long associated with the Congress. | Full coverage of Lok Sabha elections in MaharashtraAmong other prominent leaders from Maharashtra in the first list of candidates are Union minister Nitin Gadkari from his hometown Nagpur, state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve from Jalna, Union MoS Hansraj Ahir from Chandrapur and Union MoS for defence Subash Bhamre from Dhule. Late BJP MP Gopinath Munde\u2019s daughter, Pritam, who was elected to Parliament with a record majority after her father\u2019s death, has been renominated from Beed. Sitting MP from Sangli Sanjay Patil has also been renominated, putting an end to speculation over any change in constituency. Patil\u2019s candidature was opposed by a section of BJP leaders in Sangli. However, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is understood to have called a meeting of local party leaders and resolved the differences. The party has also given tickets to Heena Gavit from Nandurbar, Raksha Khadse from Raver, Poonam Mahajan from Mumbai North Central, Kapil Patil from Bhiwandi, Sanjay Dhotre from Akola, Ramdas Tadas from Wardha, Ashok Nete from Gadchiroli and Gopal Shetty from Mumbai North.

Sleuths suspect absconding IMA founder-owner Mohammed Mansoor Khan took the jewellery with him when he fled the country. Khan owned two jewellery showrooms in Bengaluru \u2014 one in Jayanagar and another in Shivajinagar. Both showrooms were sealed by police since June 10 after thousands of investors thronged the Commercial Street police station seeking help in getting their money back. As part of their investigation, SIT sleuths had descended on the jewellery showroom in Jayanagar to take stock of ornaments in the three-storeyed building. Quoting those who had visited the showroom when it was fully functional, police said: \u201cDifferent designs of gold, diamond and platinum ornaments were showcased the building. While some came to buy ornaments there were many who came to obtain loans by pledging gold. Almost all the display cases and cupboards were filled with ornaments when the store was fully functional.\u201d Now, sleuths say, all the display units are barring a few scattered ornaments in some shelves. SIT sleuths deployed around two dozen 20 goldsmiths and jewellery experts to ascertain the value of the ornaments. \u201cThe counting will continue till Tuesday morning. We expect the value of the ornaments left behind to be around Rs 20 crore,\u201d sources said.

The raid was conducted at a house on Venkatappa Road in Shivajinagar, where Khan\u2019s third wife, who was divorced in February this year, lived with her family. During the raid, SIT sleuths recovered 1.8kg of gold ornaments. The estranged wife and her family argued with the sleuths saying the seized gold belong to them.

It doubtless raised spirits that India, in fine form and having won all their previous World Cup encounters with Pakistan, also had local boy KL Rahul step out to open the Indian innings with Rohit Sharma.

At M Chinnaswamy Stadium, huge crowds gathered to watch the match on the big screen. \u201cIndia vs Pakistan is the biggest of all World Cup matches,\u201d said Sagar Bhat, the proprietor of Angrezi - Bollywood Bar & Kitchen on Church Street. \u201cIt is the mother of all matches. We were overflowing with customers and, unlike usual, did not play any music as patrons wanted to follow the live telecast.\u201d Rahul Menon, a software employee, watched the match at Koramangala Social. \u201cThe match was enthralling and the pub offered exciting discounts too,\u201d he said.

Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Congratulations to him on becoming the working president of the party,\" the Prime Minister added. Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president. Nadda has long experience of the party organisation as he was the in-charge of the party headquarters and is a popular figure.

Ketki Shah Talati, a resident of Devarabisanahalli, said in her complaint to Basavanagudi police that she and her husband had invested Rs 1.7 crore in various real estate firms which Karvy Private Wealth, Basavanagudi branch had suggested after claiming to have done due diligence. Police registered a case of cheating against Karvy CEO Abhijth Bhave and directors and officials of a few other real estate firms in which the couple and 11 others had invested more than Rs 4 crore. Ketki alleged that Karvy had lured them by promising good returns for investments and claimed they hadn\u2019t received any returns or got back their investment. \u201cThe complainants alleged that Karvy had not arranged direct interaction with builders with whom they had invested their money and requested legal action against the head and directors of the Karvy Group companies,\u201d police said, quoting the complaint. \u201cWe registered a case of cheating and requested all details and documents about their investments for verification.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Considered close to irrigation minister D K Shivakumar and \u201cfavoured\u201d by the JD(S) first family, Singh\u2019s continued presence in the seat of BDA commissioner had created tension between the chairman for the authority Congress MLA S T Somashekar and CM Kumaraswamy. Somashekar along with Byrathi brothers, Basavaraju and Suresh had created a parellel power centre in Bengaluru and had taken on the CM for continuing Singh as the commissioner. Singh will continue to hold the post of principal secretary for irrigation department under minister D K Shivakumar and have concurrent charge of medical education department held by minister E Tukaram. While Singh\u2019s transfer out of the BDA commissioner post may be a small victory, the appointment of Dr Manjula does not seem to be any favourable to Somashekar and the Bengaluru coterie of MLAs. The young IAS officer, who served as the tourism and municipal administration commissioner previously, is known for her straight forward attitude and no nonsense attitude. Manjula is a 2002 batch IAS officer and will be the first woman bureaucrat to head the civic agency since its inception in the 1980s. Meanwhile, in other major reshuffles, the government has transferred additional chief secretary for UDD Mahendra Jain to Energy department and also placing him in concurrent charge of higher education. The incumbent ACS (Energy) P Ravi Kumar has been posted as ACS to government. B H Anil Kumar will be the new ACS for UDD and also hold concurrent charge of food and civil supplies department. Yet another high profile transfer is that of Priyanka Mary Francis, who was posted as Hassan deputy commissioner during the Lok Sabha elections by the election commission of India. While Franscis was transferred out soon after the polls, she was waiting for posting. Francis will now be the new director for information technology and biotechnology.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

He urged Modi to extend maximum help to the state which has been suffering from consecutive years of drought and sought release of Rs 1,500 crore dues under the rural employment guarantee scheme.  At Niti Aayog's meeting, Kumaraswamy raised a host of issues, including decreasing fund flow to the state under centrally sponsored schemes. \"The overall estimated grants from the Centre dipped from Rs 16,525 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 10,099 crore in 2019-20. This has not only put pressure on the state's finances but affected other initiatives,\" the CM said. He also took exception to Bengaluru getting 58th rank in the ease of living index in Niti Aayog's ranking system. \"This is unacceptable. Bengaluru is widely rated as the most preferred city for work in the country by reputed agencies. So, Aayog's ranking system should be more participative and transparent,\" he opined.  During his meeting with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the CM stressed the need for amending banking rules to give preference to candidates with knowledge of local languages in recruitments for regional rural banks and also conducting banking exams in all the 22 recognised languages.

The school\u2019s Kannada medium section has only two in its class. The enrolment figures are similar at a government school in JP Nagar, Bengaluru. A growing belief that English-medium education opens up more possibilities for children has triggered a significant shift in attitudes in poor families, which traditionally preferred Kannada as the mode of learning for reasons ranging from ease of communication to continuation of the local culture. The change has been evident in the falling enrolments at Kannada medium schools for some time, and the state has now taken it as the cue for promoting English in classrooms. English medium sections have been started at dozens of government Kannada schools across Karnataka this year, and officials have received a deluge of admission requests, in many cases, more than they can allow or process. For example, 14 government schools in Bengaluru South have received 290 applications for class 1 English medium and 90 in lower KG. They have not received any for the same grade in Kannada medium. Chief minister HD Kumaraswamy has strongly endorsed the push for English. Experts say the measure is necessary to keep government and aided schools open and relevant. In 2018, 28,847 such schools, which lacked English medium, shut down as they didn\u2019t have enough students to run classes. The Right to Education (RTE) Act provided many poor families an opportunity to place their kids in private institutions, which they otherwise cannot afford. But only a certain number of poor students can be accommodated in private schools through RTE. This created space for the state to step in and draw parents back with a pitch for English education. Kumaraswamy announced the launch of 1,000 English medium sections at government schools. The model, it seems, has been borrowed from Kerala. Kannada medium schools with English sections are now called Kannada Public Schools, and the government has deployed 1,443 teachers there. The number of students per class in English medium has been limited to 30, which has upset parents whose wards are currently outside this cutoff. The average student-teacher ratio is 20:1. Currently, 973 English medium sections are functional and 23 are in the pipeline. Additionally, 300 are being introduced in the existing pool of English medium sections because of the high demand. An official with the state department of public instruction (DPI) said more students would have applied for or joined classes had the government announced the decision before April. But the impetus to English learning has touched off a debate with many saying it will cause irreparable damage to Kannada medium. SG Siddaramaiah, the chairman of Kannada Development Authority, has been one of the most of vocal critics. Giving the issue a political colour, he said a regional party that should be protecting the local language and culture was taking detrimental steps. \u201cThe previous governments extended full support to the development of Kannada. It\u2019s extremely disappointing that a regional party, which should be making efforts to keep the local language relevant for Kannada asmithe (Kannada pride), is introducing English medium and bulldozing opposition to it,\u201d he said. But Kumaraswamy told TOI that the decision to open English medium divisions would not have any impact on Kannada sections. \u201cDefinitely not. We are not against Kannada medium schools, and the government is not ready to close them,\u201d he said. The push towards English, the chief minister said, was part of a larger effort to improve the quality of education in Karnataka. \u201cLast year, over 40 lakh children in government schools were assessed for learning levels. Based on the outcome, various measures are being taken to improve their learning abilities. Teachers are being trained, and over Rs 1,000 crore is being spent on improving infrastructure, etc. So, I believe that these initiatives would definitely pay rewards in future,\u201d he said in a response to queries sent by TOI. Kumaraswamy added that the English initiative would cater to aspirations of economically backward families which cannot afford to send their children to private schools. \u201cWe have received an overwhelming response from parents and requests to begin additional sections in certain schools. We will take a decision based on the availability of trained teachers,\u201d he said.

Bengaluru's \u2018Islamic banker\u2019 has fled India, complaints cross 23,000 in IMA scamPoliticians of the minority community admitted that their credibility was at stake because some of them had, through their public association with IMA\u2019s founder-owner Mohammed Mansoor Khan, given legitimacy to his criminal enterprise. They said the impact of the swindle by Ambidant Marketing Pvt Ltd, whose business model was similar to IMA\u2019s, would pale in comparison to the negative fallout from the IMA rip-off.  IMA office in Shivajinagar \u201cPoliticians were spotted with Mansoor at public functions he hosted such as mushairas (poetic symposiums),\u201d a source said. \u201cBut Mansoor actually got ulemas to endorse his audit books. Two years ago he brought out a booklet based on these endorsements, stating that all investments in his firm were halal (permissible).\u201d A senior Muslim Congress leader said there is a crisis of confidence among the community towards politicians and ulemas. \u201cCertain ulemas, instead of speaking on the Quran\u2019s teachings in their Friday sermons, asked their congregations to pray for the welfare of Mansoor and his companies,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them even issued fatwas endorsing his business, when most of them were unaware of how financial institutions should operate.\u201d Hundreds of investors have filed a police complaint at the convention centerSources said a majority of Muslim politicians were beneficiaries of Mansoor\u2019s largesse either through election funding or projects like renovation of government schools. \u201cThe fact that they were seen with Mansoor gave confidence to people who had some savings,\u201d one source said. Complaint letters submitted by investors in IMA ponzi scam are piling up at Commercial Street Police StationIn Karnataka, Muslim political leadership has largely been the monopoly of the Congress. But Muslim leaders have never been able to unite as a consolidated entity. \u201cJealousy among leaders, political machinations to upstage one another and a generation gap are the reasons that the community does not speak in one voice,\u201d a source said. That the Congress gave just one ticket to the community in the recent Lok Sabha polls, when the norm in the past was two to three, has demotivated Muslim leaders. \u201cThe party leadership has taken the community for granted. The Lok Sabha polls, in which many Muslims voted for the BJP, should be an eye-opener,\u201d a source said. Members of the community said there has been no true Muslim leader after former minister Azeez Sait, who passed away in 2001, and was known for his no-nonsense stand on issues. \u201cMoney power works now, which is not my style of functioning,\u201d a Muslim Congress leader said. \u201cThe Congress sidelined people like K Rahman Khan, CK Jaffer Sharief (when he was alive), CM Ibrahim and K Naseer Ahmed for their forthright views.\u201d Young politicians like Rizwan Arshad, UT Khader, NA Haris and Syed Naseer Hussain wield considerable influence in the party, but are yet to strike a chord with the community, he said.
