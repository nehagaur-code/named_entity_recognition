At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Satta Matka 2018": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/agra-court-rejects-satta-king-shyam-vohra-bail-plea/articleshow/65506776.cms", "time": "", "description": "AGRA: Shyam Vohra, known as 'satta king' of the Taj city, was denied bail by district court of Agra.

The HC had earlier directed the Railways to provide amenities like ramps, low-height booking windows and drinking water taps.

They will now say we will take 100 more years to identify critical wildlife areas,\u201d remarked a bench of chief justice Pradeep Nandrajog and justice Nitin Jamdar. The court was hearing a public interest litigation by NGO Vanashakti on protection and conservation of wildlife and wildlife habitat following the failure of authorities to demarcate critical wildlife habitats in forest areas. Advocates Ahmed Abdi and Zaman Ali argued that many critically endangered species had become extinct due to inaction on the part of authorities. The court was told there are 49 wildlife sanctuaries and six national parks in Maharashtra. The judges noted that the 2006 Act states critical wildlife habitats need to be kept inviolated and free from human intervention.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught.

Tilak Nagar police have moved the 72nd metropolitan magistrate, Vikhroli, over sealing flats 601, 702, 801 and 1101 of the C wing as builders Hemendra Mahapara and Subhak Mahapara have failed to turn up before the police despite reminders.

They said the lack of demand among students for pure science courses was a worrisome trend. \u201cEvery year, we are seeing a drop in the BSc cut-offs. It is sad that no one wants to join the sciences,\u201d Jai Hind College principal Ashok Wadia said. Shobana Vasudevan, principal of Podar College, said their cut-offs had risen marginally for commerce. Students from science and arts applying for BMS have increased tremendously, pushing up the cut-offs, said Vasudevan. While the cut-off for arts for students from boards other than state board at St Xavier\u2019s College was 98.4%, for HSC students it closed at 98.42% in the first round. After admitting students in the in-house quota, St Xavier\u2019s had about 12 seats for students from other boards and eight for the ones from the HSC board. In Mithibai and Ruia, arts closed at over 95% in the first list, a welcome trend, said principals. All these colleges have seen a marginal increase in their arts cut-offs. \u201cThe rise can be attributed to the majority constitution of in-house arts students belonging to the open category seeking admission back into Ruia, as a consequence of which the arts cut off may have gone up for 2019,\u201d Ruia College principal Anushree Lokur said. She said the rise only applies to the open category of admissions for the year. Among the job-oriented, self-financed courses, cutoffs for BMS (Commerce) rose to higher than 95% in some colleges, whereas in most colleges a drop was seen in the case of BFM, another popular course. \u201cThe cut-offs for seeking admission into NM College in comparison to last year are very similar and there is only a marginal difference for this academic year,\u201d NM College principal Parag Ajgaonkar said.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath.

On Sunday, he was inducted as the minister for school education, sports and youth welfare. The move assumes significance as it comes during admission season. These departments were earlier held by Vinod Tawde, who will be now left with higher and technical education, welfare of minorities and Marathi language. Shelar, who started his political career during his student days in 1988 with ABVP, was seen as a potential state-level leader. A law graduate and two-term corporator, he became an MLC in 2012 before contesting the assembly polls in 2014. Meanwhile, he got opportunities to prove himself as a election strategist in the 2017 civic polls. During his term, BJP\u2019s tally in the BMC reached up to 83 when Sena-BJP contested separately. He has also been actively focussing on the city\u2019s civic infrastructure and other issues. He is said to share a good rapport with Amit Shah as the BJP national president has visited him at his residence several times during his Mumbai visits. Shelar is involved the sports sector, taking a cue from NCP chief Sharad Pawar. The former chairman of Mumbai Cricket Association also held the post of chairman of BCCI marketing committee. He worked with the Mumbai football association and Rope Skipping Association and has been vice chairman of the Rajasthan Sports Club. In BJP circles, the CM's decision to give school education department to Shelar is being viewed as a setback for Tawde.

The final dip made by Chanchal Lahiri\"He performed almost an hour earlier. Hence, river traffic police was absent,\" said a Port division officer. Police said Lahiri drowned around 12.30pm and it is unclear whether he was performing or practising the act.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

The case was registered at Powai police station three months ago after the victim complained that Vijay Deshmukh continued to harass her on social media and her college email ID by sending obscene messages and objectionable pictures even after he was sacked from the institute in 2018. \u201cThe accused, who is unemployed and unmarried, was issued summons as the incident occurred between 2016 and 2019,\u201d said a police officer. \u201cHe didn\u2019t respond to the summons, so we sent a team to Satara and nabbed him.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

This year, the municipal corporation says it is better prepared and will clear water from Hindmata faster. Though the BMC does not guarantee a totally flood-free area, it says the drain augmentation work it carried out in Hindmata will ensure rainwater does not remain accumulated for long periods. A visit to several waterlogging spots identified by the traffic police in Dadar, Sion, King\u2019s Circle and Mahim found that while many works had been completed, concerns among locals remained. Works to reconstruct 2,500 metres of storm water drain (SWD) lines were taken up by the BMC around Hindmata \u2014 at Madkebuwa Chowk at Parel and Lalbaug police chowki. In the stretch from Lalbaug police chowky to Shravan Yashwante Chowk, while earlier there was an SWD line of 3000 mm by 2700 mm, there is an extra SWD proposed of 1,800 mm diameter, said officials. This work, though not fully complete, is expected to provide some relief. \u201cThis is a low-lying area and one cannot give a guarantee that water will not accumulate on a heavy rain day. But with augmentation works done, we hope that unlike earlier years, when rainwater would remain for an entire day, the accumulation may last only a few hours,\u201d local corporator Urmila Panchal from the Shiv Sena said. A resident of Bhoiwada, Panchal said pumps for de-watering had also been placed. Then there are the other waterlogging spots like Dadar TT and Five Gardens.

While the number of mishaps registered by the police have dropped in two years, the fatalities have risen and this was a disturbing trend, said experts. In Mumbai, however, there was a dip in road fatalities by 20% in the past one year. The fatalities across Maharashtra rose 7% from 12,264 to 13,084 in a year while the fatalities in road mishaps in Mumbai dipped from 490 to 410. The number of mishaps dropped from 39,848 cases across state to 35,955 in two years. Transport expert A V Shenoy said the main cause of accidents was indiscipline among drivers, speeding or overtaking and lack of sleep. \u201cHuman error is the number one cause of accidents followed by other factors like technical fault in vehicle,\u201d he stated. The survey report mentioned that the number of accidents per ten thousand vehicles in Maharashtra during 2018 was 10.

Sources said the objective was to increase ridership, which has fallen drastically over the years, to 50 lakh from the present 25 lakh. It will also encourage more office-goers to use public transport, thus reducing the congestion and pollution caused by private cars. Pardeshi, who is positive about reviving the cash-strapped BEST, has also proposed having more AC buses on busy routes, with at least 200 smaller AC buses hitting the roads by October-November, and increasing the BEST fleet to 6,000 buses in two years. He also suggesting introducing an app to provide live tracking of all buses with the \u201cexpected time of arrival\u201d, to ensure that passengers wait for buses and do not switch to autos or taxis. BEST general manager, Surendrakumar Bagde, said he will be meeting Pardeshi on Monday to finalise the new fare structure and other sops to be given to passengers, and the related financial burden. \u201cWe expect BMC to compensate for the losses incurred by providing highly subsidised fares,\u201d he said. This kind of fare reduction would mean a death knell for share autos and taxis on feeder routes, he added. \u201cWe expect 450 Mini/ Midi AC and non AC buses to hit the roads by November, and 80 electric buses by year end. These will be mainly deployed on feeder routes,\u201d he stated. Shashank Rao, leader of the BEST Workers\u2019 Union, who had signed the MoU allowing the wet leasing of smaller buses, is also the leader of the the largest autorickshaw union in the city. He believes that the MoU is in the best interest of the BEST workers, and that the auto business will not be hit. Further, Rao demanded a crackdown on the illegal autos plying without permits and driver badges. Pardeshi, who is keen to strengthen the city\u2019s public transport, said that buses should have more visibility on roads, should be affordable for commuters and efficient in service. The areas which are likely to witness more AC buses in the near future include Fort, Churchgate, Nariman Point, Lower Parel, Mahalaxmi, Elphinstone Road, Dadar, Malad, and Goregaon, among others.

Boisar police have been cracking down on illegal sale and transport of gutka, drugs and other crimes in their jurisdiction. Sources said since about a month, Naukudkar had been visiting the Boisar police station and asking Parabkar to go slow on the drive. When Parabkar refused to budge, the constable reportedly raised the bribe money. This angered the inspector who filed a case. It is not known how much money was offered. A case under the Prevention of Corruption Act has been registered against Naukudkar, who was suspended on Monday. Police officials said that an internal inquiry will be initiated into the allegations and Naukudkar will be terminated if he is found guilty.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

By contrast, the national growth rate is pegged at a lower 6.8% for 2018-19. The survey shows although growth rate in the agricultural and industrial sectors is set to decline compared to 2017-18, in the services sector it is expected to rise from 8.1% to 9.2%. Given the much higher share of the services sector in the computation of the value of economic activity in the state, this rise appears to have restored the growth rate. The survey showed a decline in estimated growth rate in the agricultural sector from 3.1% in 2017-18 to 0.4% in 2018-19 as a result of drought. While crop output showed growth of (-)8% in 2018-19, the survey forecast a rise in growth rate of several other segments. Growth rate in the livestock segment is expected to rise sharply from 8.5% in 2017-18 to 13.9%, while that in forestry and logging is set to double from 8.1% to 16.4%.

The manufacturing sector is set to see a decline from 7.7% to 7.1%, while that in electricity and other utilities is estimated to decline from 6.5% to 4.3%. Mining and quarrying are expected to see a big dip from 7.2% to 2.9% But growth rate in the construction sector is set to improve significantly from 7.9% to 9.9%. Within the services sector, the financial, real estate and professional services segment is set to see a rise in growth rate from 7.6% to 9.4% while the trade, hotels and communications segment is expected to improve its growth from 7.6% to 9.4%.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

TOI had reported on the drop in the rabi crop output on June 7. The winter crop covers an average 53 lakh hectares in Maharashtra. The kharif or monsoon crop stands on roughly 150 lakh hectares and is the main crop in the state. The drought in 2018-19 affected 42% of the state\u2019s talukas and has caused a severe water crisis. Live water storage in the state\u2019s dams is 6.43% of total capacity. In Marathwada, it is just 0.5% of capacity. The production of rabi cereals is set to decline by 68%, pulses by 51% and oilseeds by a huge 70%, the economic survey shows. The output of rabi wheat is expected to fall by 61% and maize by 75% and harbhara (gram) by 52%. Within the oilseeds cluster for the rabi crop, the production of sesame (til) is expected to fall by as much as 92%. The picture for the kharif crop was mixed. The estimates show that despite the drought, sowing for the kharif crop increased, though very marginally. While the production of kharif foodgrains is set to decline by 12% in 2018-19 compared to the previous year, the output of kharif oilseeds is expected to rise by 16%. Sugarcane production is set to increase by 10% and cotton by 17%. However, within the oilseeds cluster, groundnut production is expected to decline by 33%, sesame by 58% and sunflower by 74%. The output of kharif cereals is expected to decline by 6% compared to 2017-18, while the pulses output is expected to fall by 35%. The production of toor dal is set to fall by 45%. However, the production of rice is set to rise by 28% and soyabean by 20%, the data shows. The area under horticulture also saw a decline. During 2018-19, the area under horticulture crops is 16.43 lakh hectares, and production is expected to be 224 lakh tonnes. In 2017-18, the area was 17.22 lakh hectares, and production was 248.53 lakh tonnes. The decline in horticulture output was 9.6%. CM Devendra Fadnavis had earlier, after chairing the kharif review meeting, said that \u201cdespite the drought, the state has managed an output of 115 lakh metric tonnes, which is higher than other drought years.\u201d According to him, \u201cThis is because of our water conservation initiatives and increased investment in agriculture.

In 2018-19, with 73% rain, it was 115 lakh tonnes.\u201d The CM had said that although delayed, the forecast for this monsoon was excellent. The forecast for central Maharashtra was 93-107%. Even in arid Marathwada, the forecast was 89-111%. \u201cWe will use SMS services to communicate forecasts to farmers so they can sow at the right time.

Constable Omprakash Munde, 27, was on night duty on Saturday. Around 12.05am, the operator of a public toilet on platform 1-2 told Munde about a man lying sprawled at the entrance to the toilet. Munde went to the man (Devendra) and woke him up. Devendra, who was sloshed, had collapsed in front of the toilet. Angry at being woken up, he hurled abuses at Munde. Expecting him to get violent, Munde called up his colleague, Shende, for help. Shende, who was on duty at Chunabhatti station, reached GTB Nagar. Meanwhile, Devendra ran towards Munde and started hitting him, leading to a scuffle between the two. According to the FIR, Devendra started to drag Munde towards the tracks and said he was going to \u201cpush the cop on the tracks, in front of a running train, and kill him\u201d.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination.

In a letter to the education department on Monday, the council has called the decision to be \u201cnot only mala fide, but also illegal and liable to be struck down\u201d. This year, SSC results took an over 10% hit as the board withdrew 20-mark internal exams for languages and social sciences. Following an outrage, then education minister Vinod Tawde met with senior officials and principals to review the results and came up with a formula to help SSC students in the FYJC race. Among the solutions proposed was to exclude internal exam marks for CBSE and ICSE students and to increase seats in sought-after junior colleges. The education department then wrote to the CBSE and CISCE demanding they share the details of the marks of internal/practical/oral and theory examination in each subject. While the CBSE has already shared the data with the education department, the CISCE has registered its displeasure. The council, in its letter, has stated that the education department\u2019s communication threatened that if the data was not furnished, then students who passed out of ICSE will not be allowed to participate in class XI admission procedure. \u201cIn their last letter on June 16, we were informed that CBSE had shared the data and if we failed to do so by Monday evening, ICSE students would be allowed to participate in the admission process only after the third round,\u201d Gerry Arathoon, secretary and chief executive officer of CISCE told TOI.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The dropout rate of upper primary students has gone up from 1.06% (2016-17) to 1.56% (2017-18), whereas that for higher secondary school students increased from 2.4% (2016-17) to 2.9% (2017-18). Educationists have, however, said that the numbers, even if higher compared to previous years, don\u2019t show the real picture. \u201cThe dropout data varies from source to source, and there is no uniformity. However, there is also a shortage of colleges across the state which could result in dropout at the higher secondary level. The dropout rate could be higher if compared from Class I enrolments vis-a-vis Class XII enrolments,\u201d said Hemangi Joshi, an RTE (Right to Education) activist. Activists have also called for a central admission and monitoring system to plug the gaps in data. \u201cCurrently, the state doesn\u2019t know where the dropout is happening, especially after Class X and Class XII, since the students don\u2019t necessarily opt for a higher secondary course or college degree. We have time and again written to the government to bring in a monitoring system which can track all students across institutes in the state and country,\u201d said Vaishali Bafna of SYSCOM, a Pune-based think tank. Experts also feel the need to concentrate on quality of primary education. \u201cIt is easy to say that students drop out of the education system because of poverty, but a large number lose interest in education as the quality of education is poor. There is also a lot of inter-state migration which displaces students and causes children to drop out,\u201d said educationist Heramb Kulkarni.

The consignments would arrive without the address of the consignee being mentioned. A call would be made to the sender and, based on instructions, the gold would be delivered. The smuggled gold was delivered to jewellers operating in Kalbadevi, Zaveri Bazaar, BKC and other places in Mumbai for a hefty commission. Following a tip off, the DRI intercepted 12 cargo consignments at the office of Concor Air Ltd, an agency that deals in domestic air cargo, at Santacruz. Four of the arrested have been released on bail. Three other arrested accused, Sanjay Didwania (49), Manohar Kothari (47) and Jaiprakash Saini (29), were produced before the Esplanade court and sent to judicial custody till June 30. The senders have not been arrested and DRI is conducting further raids across the country. DRI officials said this was the new modus operandi being adopted by smugglers to dodge authorities.

Besides, at least 250 exotic birds, including yellow budgies and green conure, were found packed into 20 to 25 tiny cages. Six people have been arrested and Rs 1.09 crore seized from the shops.

Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president. Nadda has long experience of the party organisation as he was the in-charge of the party headquarters and is a popular figure.

The accused was arrested from Hyderabad on charges of theft within 48 hours of the crime. Safutullah Gayani, the accused, was working at a gold polishing unit owned by Rampad Santra at Sai Nagar for the past eight months. There were four other workers at the unit. Every evening, the unit's manager, Shaikh Momin, would collect ornaments polished by the staff and lock it in a vault inside the workshop. The key to the vault used to be with Momin. All the employees would sleep inside the workshop at night. On June 11, Rampad received a consignment of bangles and pendants weighing 1kg for polishing. The order was to be completed soon. The workers worked till late and went to sleep around 6am on June 12. At 10.30am, the shop owner received a phone call from a nervous Momin. He told Santra that 1kg gold ornaments had vanished from the vault. CCTVs in the unit showed Gayani applying glue on every camera. One of the cameras outside the shop had captured him walking away with a carry bag. After Santra lodged a police complaint, the police checked Gayani's call data record (CDR). \"Gayani wasn't carrying his cellphone. We contacted the people and learnt that he was on his way to Pune and then to Hyderabad. Our team picked him up from Hyderabad,\" said senior inspector Nitin Pondkule. Gayani admitted to taking out keys to the vault from Momin's trouser pocket, while he was asleep. He claimed that his employer hadn't paid him his salary, but Rampad has denied this. \"The entire looted gold ornaments have been recovered from Gayani,\" said DCP Sangramsinh Nishandar. \"The accused has worked in a few other polishing units before.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister said an active and effective opposition is a necessity in a democracy and pointed out that a well- argued and factual criticism of the government strengthens democracy. \"Sometimes such positive contributions are not noticed as they do not get high TRPs,\" he said. Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Chawla was walking towards his car with a bag containing Rs 4 lakh when he was shot in the temple by two masked men. What left his kin baffled and the community of liquor shop owners nervous was that the assailants first shot Chawla and then grabbed his bag. Chawla hailed from an affluent family that has business interests in construction, real estate and restaurants. The Vanrai police and multiple units of the crime branch have been working on the case. \"It's unfortunate that the killers havent been tracked down. The investigators seem to be trying their best,\" said Sumit, Chawla's brother. He added that the police had checked out the backgrounds of current and past employees at Chawla's wine shop. On June 10, 2018, Chawla shut his shop, Goregaon Wines near Virvani Industrial Estate, around 11.20pm. He started walking towards his car parked 100 metres away, accompanied by an employee named Kamlesh Yadav. Suddenly, two masked men in black cloth walked up with a pistol and shot Chawla in the left temple. The bullet exited from under his eye. As Chawla screamed in pain, the robbers picked up his bag of cash and fled. Yadav, who was unhurt, held a profusely bleeding Chawla and yelled for help. Some of the staffers heard him and alerted a patrolling police vehicle. Chawla was taken to the Bal Thackeray Trauma Hospital and then moved to Kokilaben Ambani Hospital where he died.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

Rainfall was reported from many parts of the city on Monday, but the showers were short-lived. \u201cLower level winds are incurring the moisture, hence we are witnessing convective activity, but it has to sustain the monsoon pattern, which is lagging. We are waiting for sufficient moisture in the atmosphere,\u201d she added. Convection in the atmosphere is the way air floats up on account of being warmer than surrounding air. Maximum temperatures in the city continued to remain on the higher side on Monday hovering around 34 degrees Celsius.

The prosecution alleged that the duo had returned to Tadvi\u2019s room to \u2018steal the suicide note\u2019 and \u2018destroy evidence\u2019 from Tadvi\u2019s phone. \u201cTheir demeanour shows they committed the crime with extreme cruelty and a cool mind,\u201d the nine-page reply to the bail plea said. During the hearing before the special court on Monday, special public prosecutor Raja Thakare submitted the reply against Ahuja (28), Khandelwal (27) and Dr Bhakti Mehare (26), Tadvi\u2019s seniors at Nair Hospital who have been accused of harassing and ragging Tadvi and making casteist comments, which allegedly drove her to commit suicide in her eighth floor hostel room on May 22. The prosecution\u2019s reply stated that the last phone conversation Tadvi had was with Ahuja, but added: \u201cAhuja is not divulging correct information about the call. She claims she spoke to Tadvi about work.\u201d Questioning why the accused were the first to reach Tadvi\u2019s room, the prosecution said that on May 22, at 7pm, Ahuja and Mehare knocked on Tadvi\u2019s room, but got no no response. They then called others, broke open the door and found Tadvi hanging from the ceiling fan. The prosecution also questioned why the three accused had reached Tadvi\u2019s floor before the suicide was discovered. It said that they had been unable to answer this. \u201cIt has been established during probe that on the day of the incident at 7pm, Ahuja and Mehare...came down from their ninth floor room to Dr Snehal\u2019s room on the eighth floor. Khandelwal followed them. Soon after, they called others.\u201d The prosecution added that after Tadvi\u2019s body was carried to the lift, instead of going with the group, Ahuja and Khandelwal went to Tadvi\u2019s room and were there for around five minutes, which was caught on CCTV camera. The reply also said Tadvi had called her mother at 3.39pm and complained about how the three seniors had worsened the harassment and threatened to not let her complete education after she had complained against them, to which her mother said she would come to the city. . \u201cThe victim belonged to a...scheduled tribe community, whereas the accused are... part of privileged society.

The policy included personal accident coverage. Hiren got married and went on a honeymoon to Manali on a trip organized by Heena Tours and Travels. One of the attractions was paragliding. The paragliding activities were operated by trained persons. Hiren\u2019s parachute, however, developed a technical snag, and the pilot could not control it, leading to a crash on a rocky hill. Hiren sustained grievous injuries in the accident which occurred on December 10, 2014. He was hospitalized till January 6, 2015 after which he returned to Mumbai for further hospitalization and treatment which continued till April 4, 2015. As the accident had occurred during subsistence of the policy-- valid from November 20, 2014 to November 19, 2015-- he filed a claim under the policy. The insurer rejected the claim on the ground that paragliding was a risky activity, and that the policy did not cover accidents occurring during aviation or ballooning except as a bonafide passenger. Since Hiren was paragliding, the insurer termed it a hazardous activity which was excluded under the policy. Hiren approached the insurance ombudsman who upheld the insurer\u2019s stand, so he filed a consumer complaint. Advocate Ami Mandani who represented Hiren, argued the exclusion clause was not applicable since Hiren was not operating the parachute while paragliding, but was merely enjoying a joy ride which was being operated by a trained pilot. Even a tour operator had endorsed this fact, but the insurer argued the tour operator was not entitled to opine. It defended the repudiation under clause 4.19 of the policy.  The forum observed the policy was in existence since several years during which period no claim had been made. It concurred with advocate Ami Mandani that the exclusion clause would not apply to joy rides under trained pilots. The forum also noted that clause 4.19 of the policy had no bearing on the dispute. Accordingly, by its order of June 1, 2019 delivered by M P Kashar for the bench headed by Sneha Mhatre and D S Paradkar, the forum concluded the claim had been wrongly repudiated which constituted a deficiency in service. It noted even though the expenses for treatment had exceeded the coverage limit, Hiren had restricted his claim to the benefits available under the policy. The forum ordered Oriental Insurance to pay Rs 6 lakh for medical expenses and Rs 1,28,125 as personal accident benefit. Both these amounts would carry 3% interest from the date of the complaint being filed. In addition, Rs7,000 was awarded as compensation for mental agony and Rs 3,000 as litigation costs. The insurer has been given two months to comply with the order. (The author is a consumer activist and has won the Govt. of India\u2019s National Youth Award for Consumer Protection.
