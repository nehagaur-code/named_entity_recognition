The wait for monsoon is going to be long and torturous. For Bhopalis, even indoors or sundown is no comfort as the mercury stood at 43 degrees even at 8pm on Friday. And with the minimum temperature at 32.5 degrees - six degrees above normal - there is just no respite from the heat. Hot winds swept through the city at 24kmph, leaving streets deserted. There is a heat wave warning for Saturday. Thursday had enough indication of the torture that was to come at sunrise. Even at midnight, hot winds swept through the city, turning homes into bhattis. At 5.30am on Friday, the mercury stood at 33 degrees. By noon, it was 43 degrees and soon it touched the record of 46 degrees - a searing seven degrees above normal. The worst isn't over yet. The weekend may be hotter still. To put it in perspective, the hottest day ever recorded in Bhopal was 46.7 degrees. We aren't far from that, and monsoon is a fortnight away. As per Met records, the highest ever June temperature recorded in Bhopal before this was 45.6 degrees Celsius on June 10, 1979, and June 5, 1995.

Officials said that a fresh proposal in this regard has been sent to state government for approval. \"The proposal is meant to provide easy payment options to commuters.

He said that online payment option for motorists would make it easy for them to clear fines on time. \"This would also help us reduce dues related with pending challans,\" he added. This proposal comes after officials found that commuters were facing difficulty in paying e-challans issued through red light violation detection (RLVD) system. \"Many commuters, especially office-goers face difficulty in paying fines by visiting cash collection centre. This leads to delay in payment and increase in number of challans pending in name of commuters,\" said officials. One an average, 1000 motorists are issued e-challans through RLVD system for violations like signal jumping, riding without helmet, triple-ride, wrong registration plate etc. However, hardly 30 per cent violators turn up to clear their dues, and rest of the challans remains unpaid. More than 50,000 challans are already pending in name of motorists. Authorities had earlier announced to launch a mobile application for the same purpose, but the plan could not be materialized.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said.

Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Satta Matka 2018": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/agra-court-rejects-satta-king-shyam-vohra-bail-plea/articleshow/65506776.cms", "time": "", "description": "AGRA: Shyam Vohra, known as 'satta king' of the Taj city, was denied bail by district court of Agra.

Then, they saw a bigger band of monkeys, numbering 50-60, seemingly guarding the pond. \u201cThe water source was barely a few hundred meters from the cave where this group of monkeys lived. However, due to the dominance of another group, this group could not access the water source. To protect themselves from the heat, many monkeys entered the cave, but the rocks became hotter.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath. The Pro tem speaker ruled that the members stick to the format provided. After this, the members of BJP started adding 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' after end of every oath. Some of the prominent names who took oath from Madhya Pradesh included K P Yadav who defeated Jyotiraditya Scindia, Rakesh Singh, Ramakant Bhargava and Nakul Nath.

It is only logical then that people are preferring to stay indoors \u2013 including the fitness enthusiasts. Even though mornings are the preferred time for workouts, the scorching heat is making it difficult to carry on with gruelling fitness regimes. But the fitness freaks wouldn\u2019t rest until they\u2019ve had their share of workout now, would they? They opted for reversing the schedule and are preferring to carry out their fitness regime at night when it is relatively cooler outside. Be it cycling, running or trekking \u2013 fitness enthusiasts are taking to the streets, after the city goes to sleep. Just last Sunday, the much awaited Cycle Ki Marathon was organised at the super-corridor, where close to 50 cyclists pedalled 17-50 kilometers at night. It is not just events like these that have picked up pace, but even solo cyclists are preferring to complete their rides in the night. \u201cWhen the city sleeps, I burn my calories on the pedal!\u201d says college student Ayush Rikadel. He goes on to explain his reasons for choosing to hit the roads in the wee hours for cycling, \u201cHowever early you may wake up to get out and cycle, the heat becomes unbearable by 7 am in Indore. So I prefer cycling in peace along the empty, cool roads until 1 am and catching the extra sleep in morning. I have an early dinner and start off with my cycle around 10-10.30 when the citizens start retiring for the day. Sometimes I come back by 12, and at other times I push myself to cover some extra miles, which is easier when the sun is not shining over your head.\u201d It is not just cyclists who are opting the cooler night than day for fitness activities \u2013 even joggers, trekkers and marathon runners feel that night is better. IT professional Nupur Juneja puts on her running shoes post dinner and heads out for good five to ten kilometres run until midnight. \u201cWithout the sun beating down as I run, I find myself more energised and running with a better time. I complete five kilometres in a jiffy, without feeling the need to catch a break. And I feel I sleep better after a good run through the lanes of quieter Tukoganj at night.\u201d Marathoners are also prepping for the upcoming events by practising at night. Marketing manager Ashutosh Yadav covers Indore to Dewas on weekends and he prefers doing it at night. \u201cSince I run along the highway, I ensure that I wear the reflective gears for easy spotting. I cover a good 40-45 kilometers during this run. The best thing about practising at night is I don\u2019t fear dehydration and heat stroke. This helps me pump in more energy and focus on bettering my time.\u201d To make the best of these nightly runs some smaller running groups organise moonlit marathons on full moon nights. \u201cThe roads become silver and every tree, house and corner is bathed in moonlight \u2013 what could be a better motivation to run at night? For the last three full moons, we have been organising short 10 kilometer run around Residency, Palasia and Tukoganj to experience the natural nightlife. After hearing our experiences, more people have started joining in\u201d shares an entrepreneur who organises these marathons. Likewise, night trekking is another activity that is catching the fitness enthusiast\u2019s attention for the summer. Amish Jain, a freelance photographer and avid trekker has been organising and going on solo night treks for a while now. \u201cThe Indori city life is too crowded and noisy, even at night. To escape all that my friends and I trek to Kajligarh and Ralamandal during summer. Not only is it exhilarating to see the jungle nightlife, it is also a learning experience for survival as we stay alert for any sight of wild animals. But it is the star studded sky, away from the blazing halogens of city that truly makes the trek worthwhile.\u201d He signs off by adding a fair word of caution for all night time activities, \u201cThough Indore is a safe city for everyone to carry on their fitness activities at night, it is always better to be equipped with safety and first-aid tools. A small backpack with basic snacks and water along with id card and an emergency contact number is a must. And this holds true whether you are cycling or running along the city roads or trekking in the wild.\u201d Stunt riders claim the night tooThe vast expanse of super corridor and bypass road turns into a battle ground for stunt riding at night too. Led by 21-year-old MTB stunt rider Gurpreet Singh, who has been practising wheelies on the roads for the past seven years, the stunt maniacs also make the night come alive. \"I have been training to participate in international MTB stunt competition and creating a world record for the longest wheelie on a single tyre.

A humungous LED screen appealed to the curiosity of the audience that kept filling up the seats of Anand Mohan Mathur Sabhagraha, on Tuesday. Shortly after seven, Hindustani classical music exponent Gautam Kale took his place, and began on a melodious note of Raga Bhairav. The celebrated artistes and his shishyas performed the dawn-to-dusk ragas - from Raga Bhairav, which begins at the crack of dawn, to Raga Bageshri, that beckons the inky black midnight sky \u2013 in about two and a half hour program! As the singers took the audience through the journey of these ragas and their bandishein, the LED screen showed ambient visuals to indicate the time of the day or night, and the mood behind each. For instance, when the hundred melodiously synced voices sang the Raga Malhar, the screen lit up with visuals of rain, thunder and lightning. Similarly, during the midday raga, Raga Multani, the screen reflected an unending desert to signify the direct heat experienced during noon. \u201cWe attempted to take everyone on a musical journey of one day through the means of ragas, bandishein and some accompanying visuals. Besides that, we also depicted various seasons on Earth and some legendary ragas that have interesting tales associated with them,\u201d shared Gautam, who conceptualised the whole program. One of his shishyas, Mahak Agrawal, who was a part of the hundred singers who took part in the program, said, \u201cIt took a lot of practice and more than a 100 man hours to piece this together. But it was all rewarded when the audience stayed glued to our performance until the very end.\" Apart from the classical ragas and their significance, the audience was also treated to some legendary tales and anecdote associated with some ragas. \u201cIt was a revelation for me, when I learned the story behind Raga Bisalkhani Todi.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah.

Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers.

Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said.

As the state government has started purchasing onion crops at support price of Rs 800/quintal under Bhavantar Scheme, farmers of around 100km radius of the district have started reaching the mandi with their fresh crops. The number grew late on Wednesday night when the administration had to shut entry of vehicles to handle the situation. The same resulted in long queues of loading vehicles carrying crops especially onions outside the mandi while a number of trucks, which were parked inside also got stuck due to haphazardly parked vehicles. The traffic jams in and outside the mandi not only affected the business but also caused huge inconvenience to commuters. Due to the chaos, the mandi administration recorded arrival of only around 250 quintals of onion against the average arrival of around 50,000 quintal onion crops. This month, the mandi has recorded total arrival of about 4.46 lakh onion crops. The officials informed that market has capacity to accommodate arrival of 1 lakh quintal crops but on Wednesday night, over 1.25 lakh crops arrived. The traders alleged that the mandi administration has deployed 76 security guards to work in three shifts but very few of them were there to manage the traffic. \u201cSheer negligence on the part of mandi officials led to such chaotic situation in mandi on Thursday. There are many encroachments and no proper arrangement was made to guide the traffic.

He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users.

He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said.

In the third attack in 24 hours, terrorists lobbed a grenade at the headquarters of the 180 CRPF battalion camp in Tral sub-district of Pulwama late on Monday evening. The grenade exploded outside the headquarters. No casualties have been reported. The first attack happened on Monday morning when a team of security men was on a cordon-and-search operation in Achabal. Terrorists fired at the team, who then retaliated. In the Pulwama attack, the terrorists after setting off the IED, opened fire at the Army vehicle. \"Initial reports reveal the vehicle suffered extensive damage,\" the official said. Three of the soldiers injured in the blast were said to be serious, sources said.

The call centre was being operated in two buildings \u2013 Platinum Plaza and a building at plot no 74 behind C21 mall. The accused duped hundreds of Americans of crores of rupees ranging from $50 to $1,000 per person. Police officers said that social security numbers of over 10 lakh American nationals have been recovered from the accused. \u201cRahil and Jawed were the masterminds in the case. While Jawed was arrested during the raid, Rahil is said to be in Ahmedabad. Another accused Shahrukh was also arrested. These three were working with an aide Sunny Chouhan who is said to have fled to a foreign country from Ahmedabad,\u201d said Cyber Cell SP Jitendra Singh. The accused used to send an audio note to victims on WhatsApp. Through the note, they threatened the respondents with arrest because of an irregularity found in the social security number. The voice in the audio note would then share a helpline number where the victims were asked to call. The ones who fell for the trap, had to buy iTunes or Google Play gift cards, as instructed, and shared the secret code with the caller to \u2018settle\u2019 the issue. This was done by call centre employees who were given special \u2018script\u2019 for the same. The accused ran a full-fledged BPO shift from 7pm to 5 am and followed standard call centre protocols with accent trainings. Almost 70% employees arrested are from Northeast. The accused had associates in the US, China and Dubai who helped them siphon off the cash. The accused got the money duped from victims deposited into hired bank accounts. They money was converted into bitcoins and sent to the main accused in Ahmedabad who got the money through Hawala. The brokers in between who were responsible for transferring the money took at least 40% as commission. The masterminds managed to get hold of a database of social security numbers of people in the US through true search, yellow pages, that\u2019s them and through agents. These call centres were usually operated on a \u2018seating\u2019 basis. One call center had 25 seats.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Confusion prevailed at the BJP-led Indore Municipal Corporation budget meeting on Wednesday when council members started singing \"Jana Gana Mana\" when they were expected to sing \"Vande Mataram\". Worse still, the Anthem was stopped abruptly for them to sing \"Vande\". It triggered a political controversy, with Congress corporators alleging that by stopping the National Anthem midway, BJP leaders had violated the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. It\u2019s the practice at IMC that meetings of the mayoral council and general body begin with \"Vande Mataram\" and end with \"Jana Gana Mana\". However, on Wednesday, some mayoral council members stood up and started singing the National Anthem, while others sang the customary Vande Mataram. Adding to the confusion, some members stopped singing and started pointing out the mistake. After some more confusion, everyone began singing Vande Mataram. IMC Leader of Opposition Fozia Sheikh Alim said, \"It was a clear dishonour of the National Anthem. It was very disappointing to see that public representatives are confused between the National Anthem and the National Song. An FIR should be registered against all of them.\" Legal experts said that the mistake could attract legal action if it was deliberate. \"If it was a mistake, then there should not be any action against the members. Or else it would attract legal action for dishonour of the National Anthem,\" said senior advocate Anand Mohan Mathur. IMC chairman Ajay Singh Naruka said, \"Those who sang the National Anthem seemed to be confused between the National Song and National Anthem.\" Mayor Malini Gaud, however, blamed the \u201cnoisy\u201d opposition for the confusion. \u201cThe opposition was creating a ruckus before the meeting began. This led to the confusion over the National Anthem and National Song,\u201d said Gaud.
