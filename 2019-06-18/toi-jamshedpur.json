The grenade exploded outside the headquarters. No casualties have been reported. The first attack happened on Monday morning when a team of security men was on a cordon-and-search operation in Achabal. Terrorists fired at the team, who then retaliated. In the Pulwama attack, the terrorists after setting off the IED, opened fire at the Army vehicle. \"Initial reports reveal the vehicle suffered extensive damage,\" the official said. Three of the soldiers injured in the blast were said to be serious, sources said. Soon after the attack, Army, police and SOG reinforcements were rushed to the spot and a massive search operation was launched. A defence spokesman, however, said some of the men sustained minor injuries in the IED blast. Damage was minimal due to the alertness of the patrol party, he said.

Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Congratulations to him on becoming the working president of the party,\" the Prime Minister added. Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

In an effort to empower women, Anita Khandelwal, a Steel City-based homemaker, teaches women to ride two wheelers. Anita, married to a city businessman, gives this service free of cost. Talking to TOI, Anita said after her marriage she realized that many women in her family were dependent on the menfolk to take them to their destinations, as they did not know how to ride two-wheelers. It was then she started teaching the female folks of her family to ride the two wheelers, she said. Anita added that with the passage of time women from her neighbourhood too joined her course. The riding classes are held at Ram Navami maidan at Kasidih in the city. Courses are organized twice a year in summer and winter. She said till date she has taught more than 100 women to ride two wheelers. Anita told TOI that she has been doing this for more than 15 years. She said her youngest student was 16 years and oldest 60 years. Her students range from school students to teachers to businesswomen to retired persons. Anita said with the passage of time role of a woman has changed and if she does not know how to ride two wheelers in Jamshedpur, she has to be dependent on autos here, which is very troublesome at times. Anita does not charge a penny for teaching women to ride the two wheelers, rather she gives her two wheelers and fills up the tank from her pocket, said Rumpa Dutta, her student aged around 35, adding that Anita does not take any money for the damage caused to the vehicles during the course of learning. Anit has more five two wheelers of her own, which she gives free of cost to the learners, said Rumpa. Rumpa, who runs a fitness centre in the city, said it took her just one week to learn riding skills adding that Anita takes care to teach her students the road rules too. Surbhi, a teacher and tax consultant, aged around 25 years said earlier she had to depend on public transport to go to various places but after learning to ride two wheelers, her life has changed completely. Now she is independent and does not have to depend on any one to take her to the destination she has to reach. Surbhi said she learnt to ride the vehicle in a week time. She expressed her gratitude towards Anita for making her self dependent. She said during the course of learning, she fell down and thus damaged the vehicle but Anita did not charge any money for that. Surbhi said in Steel City where public transport is in the hands of auto drivers, if you do not know how to ride two wheelers, one may face speed breakers.

However, traffic movement in the periphery of the airport was hit for several minutes as police managed to control the unexpected footfall of crowd. The CM told mediapersons later that the party is confident of winning the assembly elections with two-thirds majority. \"The results of the Lok Sabha have proved that the opposition parties have lost the trust of the people. The voters have realised that only BJP, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, can deliver on its promise of development and prosperity,\" Das said.

In the AMC command area, residents are battling drinking water shortage for over two months now owing to groundwater depletion. According to the mayor of AMC, Vinod Srivastava, the municipal body has pressed six water tankers into service. \"The tankers make daily trips to all the 80 wards under the corporation, but due to the excess heat, water requirement of the residents has also increased,\" Srivastava said. However, the problem is not only limited to irregular supply of water. Adityapur residents are also complaining about receiving dirty water. \"We collected the dirty water recently in bottles and demonstrated at the AMC office, following which orders were issued for cleaning the supply lines,\" Prashant Mahato, a resident of Majhi tola in Ward number 2, said. In Mango, too, irregular supply of water by MNAC is putting the residents in a lot of trouble. In several places like Jugsalai, Pursudih, Sundernagar, Birsasnagar, among others, people are mostly having to depend on water tankers. \"We are entirely dependent on water tankers supplied by Jusco and other corporate houses. In fact, such is the condition not just during the summers but also round the year,\" Pursudih resident S K Agarwal said. In spite of the claims made by municipal officials, several handpumps in all the three municipal areas of the Steel City are not working properly. The JNAC, MNAC and Jugsalai Municipality have 930, 317 and 172 handpumps, respectively, but residents complained that many handpumps have gone dry. \"One of the reasons behind handpumps going dry is rampant construction of borewells. People living in the apartments have dug up borewells up to 700ft and have installed high-capacity motor to lift water. Due to this unauthorised withdrawal of water, handpumps in surrounding areas are going dry,\" an MNAC official said.

RJD, which put up two candidates in Jharkhand, lost and could not open its account in Bihar, too. The two candidates RJD fielded in Jharkhand - Subhash Yadav from Chatra and Ghuran Ram from Palamu - lost miserably and could not even get second position. RJD state chief Gautam Sagar Rana said the BJP candidates won only due to Modi factor. \"People voted for BJP candidates in order to make Modi the PM again,\" he said. Rana further claimed that BJP's candidate in Chatra faced much resistance from people while he was campaigning but he is still winning. Similarly, in Koderma the BJP candidate who lost in the assembly election is in a comfortable position in the parliamentary polls. He added that absence of Lalu in campaign affected mobilisation of RJD's traditional votes in its favour in Bihar. Lalu has been sentenced in fodder scam cases and is undergoing treatment in the paying ward of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) under judicial custody. Though a late riser, Lalu woke up early on Thursday and watched the election results on TV. He was glued to it for full four hours even though the results must have been unexpected and tough for him. When it was almost getting certain that the BJP-led alliance is coming back to power again, Lalu went for a brief nap, hospital sources said. \"Even after watching the results, Lalu was very cool and calm. We simply could not ascertain what is going on in his mind. His vital health parameters, including blood sugar and the blood pressure, were normal,\" said senior Rims doctor Dr D K Jha, who attended Lalu on Thursday. Jha said the overall health condition of Lalu was also fine adding that the sore on his body has also healed. He further said Lalu was mentally quite strong and is coping with his incarceration without getting restless. State RJD president Gautam Sagar Rana described the results as unexpected. \"We will have to sit and analyse the cause of our defeat. The absence of our leader Lalu Prasad adversely impacted the party's fortune in Jharkhand and Bihar,\" he said.

It may be mentioned here that at one time 40% of Steel City's population was Bengalis. It may be mentioned here that first MP (1957) from Jamshedpur seat was -- Monindro Kumar Ghosh from Indian National Congress -- a Bengali. People living in Jamshedpur (now in Jharkhand, erstwhile south Bihar) have lived in peace and harmony in this multi-lingual city, situated in a tribal belt without any problem. Samarpita, a senior teacher in an ICSE-affiliated school, are living here for nearly three generations. Talking to TOI, Samarpita said after such parochial statements by Didi, she was not sure how the people in the Hindi-speaking belt would react. Kakoli Mukherjee, a homemaker, said she hailed from Kolkata and was married in Jamshedpur and since then living here for last 50 years. She told TOI that she could never learn Hindi and always conversed with each and every Hindi-speaking people in Bangla. Never has she been discriminated on the grounds of her language. Kakoli said but after such unconstitutional comments by the Bengal CM, if she has to face the burnt from Hindi-speaking people, she will not be surprised.

Several Bengalis have help top post in this company, said Mandal adding that they have never been discriminated on the basis of the language they speak. Rather Bengalis have set flourishing cultural hubs in the city like The Milanee, The Bengal Club, Rabindra Bhavan which people from all sections of the society feel proud of, said Mandal. Mandal also reminded that Netaji Subash Chandra Bose was the president of Tisco workers union from 1928 to 1937. He said but Didi's statement on Bengal for only Bangla speaking may change equations in Steel City which is just 250km from Kolkata. He expressed anguish that it such hatred on language lines is not nipped in the bud will have deep repercussion in the days to come.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM.

I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said.

There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out.

As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time.

In the initial stage the ban saw the end of use of plastic bags in the state but as time elapsed, the bags somehow slithered into the market from the back door and are being used by shopkeepers again. To deal with this menace with an iron hand, Kolkhan commissioner Vijay Kumar Singh has instructed the DCs of East Singhbhum, Seraikela-Kharsawan, and West Singhbhum districts to come down heavily on those who do not follow the ban. He also instructed the DCs to organise special drives from May 25 to June 10 to ensure the proper implementation of the plastic ban. Instructions have been given that under the special drive plastic bags should be seized and those using it should be fined heavily. Day-to-day reports have to be filed by the district administration in this regard. It may be mentioned here that during the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the notified area committees of the respective areas had lent their hands in the proper implementation of the ban, which fizzed out with the passage of time.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Born on Jan 15, 1975 at a remote Muchidih village under Boram block in East Singhbhum district, Sahis's life was full of struggle. He passed his 10th board exam in 1991 from Ramakrishna Mission Vivekanand High School. Then he passed 12 board from Singhbhum College under Seraikela-Kharswan district. Sahis lost his father at an early age of 12, so responsibilities of his family were over him. This did not prove a hindrance for this young man to serve the society. Whenever he got time, Sahis, a bright student as told by his teachers, helped his fellow villagers. To earn a living Sahis undertook odd jobs like working as helper in the farming sector, running a poultry farm, tuition teacher. As told by his fellow villagers Sahis an honest man who was always willing to help others in the time of distress. In 2009, Sahis came in contact with AJSU-P supremo Sudesh Mahato and later got enrolled in the party. In the same year Mahato gave him the ticket from Jugsalai reserved seat (which has voters from both rural and urban areas). In that election Sahis turned out to be a dark horse and defeated three-time JMM heavyweight MLA and then state minister Dulal Bhuiyan by a margin of more than 3,000 votes. Sahis under the banner of AJSU-P triumphed in the 2014 polls too. Sahis, short build up man, is a very powerful orator, as told by many of his fellow MLAs. Sahis, a strong follower of Swami Vivekanand's ideology, believes that he is not an MLA rather a \"sevak\" of his fellow villagers and others living in the Jugsalai constituency. Residents of his constituency say that Sahis was and is always approachable like their next door neighbour. He meets people at a garage in his Mango-based house. People with all kind of problem meet their MLA, knowing he would help him/her in all possible way. Sahis believes that education is the key to development, so puts all effort to ensure better education is available in the area. Sources said it was Sahis, who toiled hard to get affiliation for Patamda degree college. Development is always a top priority for this MLA and it was his efforts which bore fruit and now villagers in and around Patamda have proper roads, drinking water and health care. Notably, Sahis would fill in the quota of AJSU-P, which is an ally of the BJP with four MLAs in the Jharkhand assembly.

The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend.

They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Samsung": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/heres-how-samsung-got-mocked-for-its-social-media-post/articleshow/69835890.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Kim Sharma": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/kim-sharma-thanks-varun-dhawan-for-the-motivation-as-the-latter-shares-a-video-of-her-from-the-gym/articleshow/69833931.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "'Champai Soren absent from JMM meet, no rift'": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/champai-absent-from-jmm-meet-no-rift-ex-mla-ramdas/articleshow/69753704.cms", "time": "2019-06-12 13:39:00", "description": "After the recent Lok Sabha poll debacle, JMM leaders under the leadership of former Ghatshila MLA Ramdas Soren met in Jamshedpur to discuss what led to party's loss from the Steel City seat.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister said an active and effective opposition is a necessity in a democracy and pointed out that a well- argued and factual criticism of the government strengthens democracy. \"Sometimes such positive contributions are not noticed as they do not get high TRPs,\" he said. Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party.

Last year, the Centre had announced a new approach to rejuvenate nine key rivers in the country- Ganga, Yamuna, Bhramaputra, Krishna, Cauvery, Godavari, Mahanadi, Narmada and Tapi. However, none from this mineral rich state was included. At a meeting headed by Das at Project Bhavan, the CM pressed for the inclusion of the two rivers in the state.

Commenting on the Singhbhum seat, where BJP's state president Laxman Gilua is contesting against the mahagathbandhan\u2019s Congress Geeta Koda, Pandey said, \u201cour party's state chief will emerge victorious.\u201d He said ground-level workers of JMM are not happy that the seat was won by Congress. Apart from the Jaganathpur assembly seat, all the other five assembly segments under Singhbhum LS seat are with JMM. Pandey also claimed that former chief minister and BJP\u2019s Khunti candidtae Arjun Munda, will continue to keep the party's flag flying high as Kariya Munda did. Notably, Kariya had won Khunti seat first in 1977. Kariya, who held the portfolio of steel ministry in the Morarji Desai government, won the seat seven times. Pandey did not express his confidence over winning Rajmahal and Lohardaga seats. In 2014, Rajmahal seat was won by JMM's Vijay Kumar Hansdak. This time it is fight between BJP's Hemlal Murmu and Mahagathbandhan's common candidate from Congress Mandal Hansda. At Lohardaga seat sitting BJP MP Sudarshan Bhagat is fighting against Congress's Rameshwar Oraon. Bhagat had won this seat in 2009 LS polls too. Lalit Oraon of BJP had first snatched this reserved seat from traditionally believed to be Congress's in 1991 polls. Meanwhile, talking to TOI from Delhi, state Congress head Ajoy Kumar appeared to be sure that his party on its own would win four seats and Mahagathbandhan will emerge victorious in eight seats. Kumar said, \"our party will win Ranchi, Lohardaga, Khunti and Chaibasa seats.\" Asked about the margin of win, Kumar said it would be a comfortable win in all places. He expressed confidence that this time tally of Mahagathbandhan will be more than of NDA in state.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

This grand old man of politics won this seat in the 1984,1989 and 2004 Lok Sabha polls. After the formation of Singhbhum Lok Sabha seat, the first Lok Sabha polls were held in 1957. Tribal-dominated Jharkhand Party's Sambhu Charan won the 1957 polls. The party managed to keep the seat in its kitty till the 1977 Lok Sabha elections. With the passage of time Jharkhand Party merged with Congress. Surprisingly in this tribal seat JMM has won only once. In the 1991 polls \u2018bahubali neta\u2019 of JMM, Krishna Mardi, won the seat, when Jharkhand Movement was at its peak. BJP's Chitrasen Sinku won the Singhbhum seat, which comprises of Seraikela, Chaibasa, Majhgaon, Jaganathpur, Manoharpur, Chakradharpur, all ST (reserved) assembly constituencies, for the first time in 1996. In the next 1998 polls it slipped into the hands of Congress. Vijay Singh Soy of Congress won the seat in that polls. Again it went back to BJP in the 1999 polls. Laxman Gilua won it under BJP banner. In the 2004 LS polls which brought UPA-I government in power under Manmohan Singh, Bagun Sumbrui won the Singhbhum seat. Former Jharkhand CM Madhu Koda, who created history by becoming the first independent candidate to sit on CM's chair backed by Congress and JMM, won the Singhbhum Lok Sabha seat in the 2009 polls. He won the seat as an independent candidate by a record margin. During the 2014 polls, riding the Modi wave sweeping across Jharkhand, Laxman Gilua won the seat defeating Geeta Koda, wife of Madhu Koda. Laxman Gilua has polled in 3,03,131 votes and Geeta Koda of Jai Bharat Samanta Party got 2,15,607 votes. Congress candidate Chitrasen Sinku finished third with 1,11,796 votes. Just before election dates were announced Geeta Koda joined the Congress camp. Keeping poll mathematics of last elections in mind the mahagahtbandhan decided to field Geeta Koda as their joint candidate. Elections in Singhbhum took place on May 12 and all eyes are on this seat and the question is whether Modi factor will work this time and help the saffron party to retain this seat from once Congress stronghold.

Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital.
