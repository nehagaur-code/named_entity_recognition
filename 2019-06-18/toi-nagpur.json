At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Lights Off": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/lightsoff/articleshow/69569987.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "GMCs at Amravati, Buldhana get in-principle approval: Mahajan": {"description": "NAGPUR: Crunch in MBBS seats will ease to some extent as the central government has given in-principle approval to seven new Government Medical Colleges in state. These include two in Vidarbha at Amravati and Buldhana. Medical education minister of Maharashtra Girish Mahajan told TOI Ministry of health and family welfare had given an in-principle approval to state government\u2019s proposal to upgrade seven district hospitals in state into medical colleges. \u201cI had a very fruitful meeting with Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan last week. He has sanctioned many proposals given by the state\u2019s health education department. These include seven GMCs and several research institutes. This will bring in 3,670 more MBBS seats and nearly 800 PG seats in the state in the long run,\u201d Mahajan said. The central government\u2019s health ministry has a scheme to establish new medical colleges by upgrading district or referral hospitals. As part of this, it has been proposed to convert 75 district hospitals into medical colleges to boost availability of human resource for health sector. Maharashtra has proactively submitted proposals for seven district hospitals. When these hospitals become medical colleges, the directorate of medical education (DMER) will run them instead of directorate of health services (DHS). This is still a first step. It takes time to establish a medical college even if a general hospital has many basic facilities. According to a senior official of DMER, the state as well as the Centre were keen to increase MBBS and MD seats as it was necessary for the implementation of EWS reservation. \u201cThe in-principle approval is a major step. These seven new GMCs will be functional in next two years,\u201d the official claimed. At present, there are 41 medical colleges in State. They are affiliated to Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS). In Vidarbha, there are two GMCs in Nagpur, and one each in Chandrapur, Yavatmal, Akola, and Gondia.

Questions have been raised over NU\u2019s move since none of the stakeholders was informed about it even as the new academic year is set to start in a couple of weeks. While concerns have been raised over damage a hurriedly prepared syllabus may leave on NU\u2019s engineering education, this year\u2019s aspirants would be at a loss of not knowing the entire four-year syllabus. Last week, the proposal was tabled before the Board of Studies (BoS) to clear the move when one of the members reflagged it and demanded an elaborate deliberation. So far, only the first-year syllabus has been formulated. Mahendra Chaudhary, who is a BoS Applied Science and Humanities as well as Senate member, was shocked to know about the proposal. He refused to sign the proposal until the BoS allowed discussion on the new syllabus. \u201cI wrote to the vice chancellor expressing my concerns. We need to think about students from the region. The AICTE curriculum is meant for IIT-level students while our colleges have 45 percenters enrolled with them. Ideally, there should be been discussion spread over months. But, now at least faculty members need to be informed through some initiative,\u201d Chaudhary said. On his demand, the NU has agreed to organize workshops, which too has been alleged as a futile exercise. \u201cThe discussion is on the proposed syllabus which means the already decided one would be implemented. Only a handful of engineering faculty members were invited to formulate this new syllabus which is not in accordance with AICTE norms,\u201d some teachers told TOI. The discussions to be held at different colleges from Monday have been dubbed as eyewash since it would deliberate on the syllabus for just over two hours. As per the workshop schedule, the discussion would taken up after lunch between 2.30pm and 4.30pm. Those opposed to NU\u2019s abrupt move wanted involvement of all stakeholders since the start. Stakeholders involve parents, students\u2019 representatives, industry professionals, academicians apart from university officials and members. Surprisingly, the NU has kept the entire affair under wraps as it never bothered to invite suggestions and objections from stakeholders in the last one and half years. The AICTE had introduced the model curriculum in January 2018. The NU also never uploaded a single document or meeting notice on its website about the move. University\u2019s Vice chancellor SP Kane didn\u2019t respond to TOI\u2019s calls and SMS. The new curriculum envisages more weightage to region specific and skill-based learning. Over 60 credits too have been cut to encourage industry internships.

They say so far they had been earning around Rs25,000-30,000 per month by working 16 hours a day. According to them, the company has increased the daily targets to 18 orders (Mon to Thursday) and 22 on weekends which is impossible to achieve and ultimately result in loss of incentives. \u201cWithout incentives, there is no earning for us,\u201d says a delivery boy from Zomato\u2019s Dharampeth zone. These boys have gone offline since last three days demanding rollback of the new policy and employment safeguards. On Sunday, they gathered at Traffic Park where they planned a massive rally to be taken out at Samvidhan Square on Monday. The company has denied any knowledge of the ongoing protest supported by Shiv Sena\u2019s city unit. Zomato city manager Vipul Sinha said he wasn\u2019t aware of the issue before disconnecting TOI\u2019s call. Those who chose to work delivered food in plain clothes rather than the trademark red T-shirts to avoid confrontation with the protesters. Shiv Sena city coordinator Nitin Tiwari said the youths are ready to work even 16 hours a day but for earlier pay package. \u201cThey work for per order commission plus weekly incentives. Since Zomato\u2019s entry in Nagpur, they have been delivery food from 7am to 11pm. Some even worked till 4am to meet the demanding targets. All they want is continuation of the same policy,\u201d Tiwari said. Tiwari said the new policy makes completion of 18 orders per day from Monday to Thursday and 22 on weekends a must for incentive payouts between Rs575 to 700. Though the payout is marginally increased, it is impossible to cater the orders within 24 hours, Tiwari said. \u201cNo incentive is paid if you fall short of even one order,\u201d he added. Another delivery agent said each order takes about one to one-and-half hours to complete before they are available for the next order. \u201cWe would need 28 hours to meet the new target. This is impossible. We have been somehow managing 16 orders by working over 16 hours in last one and half years. The distance between restaurant and client has increased now. None of bikers are given orders within 3 kms range after cycle riders were hired,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is exploitation of jobless youths. The company is threatening to file police complaints against those who are raising voice against this injustice,\u201d Tiwari said. One of the delivery boy said in case they don\u2019t qualify for incentives, their earning would reduce to just 7,000 a month.

The murder, over rivalry on gambling dens which are now controlled by top goons in the city as cops are turning a blind eye on them, likely had taken place a day ago. Mohod, having two murder charges against him, is learnt to have suffered 39 stab wounds on his body. His murder may now trigger a gang war between his close aides and \u2018Beats group\u2019 whose members, including Abhay Raut, is suspected to be involved. The case has been transffered to crime branch. Mohod was kidnapped a day ago from a Saoji eatery allegedly by Raut and his aides in a car. Around 20-25 people had come to abduct Mohod in three to four cars. It is learnt both Mohod and Raut wanted to maximize profits from the gambling dens they were operating. Raut is learnt to be operating one at Kharsoli while Mohod\u2019s was at Dhamna. Sources said Raut wanted Mohod to amalgamate their illegal businesses and share more profits which Mohod was resisting. Raut possibly lured Mohod with an offer to see a new place at Kharsoli where they could start a new den. Mohod was with his friends Rupesh Bonde and others at the eatery near Outer Ring Road from where he was taken in a car. Later, his family members and friends got a call from a close aide of Mohod that he had been murdered. Police searched for him on Sunday but found nothing. A case of kidnapping was registered at Hudkeshwar police station in the wee hours of Monday. \u201cWe received a response from cyber team that both of Mohod\u2019s cellphones were showing presence near Vela Hari village. Shortly afterwards, we found his body on the roadside,\u201d said PI Sandeep Bhosale of Hudkeshwar police station. Raut, close to arrested gangster-turned-bookie Swapnil Salunkhe, is learnt to have inflicted 44 stab wounds on his last victim Palash Diwte in October last year. Though several other names had cropped up, Hudkeshwar police insisted Raut alone was responsible for the murder. Raut got bail in this case too. After his release, he began asserting his influence. Another theory is that Mohod had threatened one Dilip for having beaten Sarang Thaokar over certain monetary dues. A relative of Mohod said Sarang owed around Rs 1.5 lakh to Salunkhe that he had lost in cricket betting. Dilip, close to Salunkhe, was threatening Sarang when Mohod intervened. Mohod had taken Sarang to Salunkhe asking him not to bother him for dues any more. Despite Mohod\u2019s intervention, Dilip had thrashed Sarang which was not taken lightly by Mohod. Top goons like Diwakar Kottulwar and his aides are also operating a major gambling den at Fetri under Hingna police station. Following a dispute at his den, Mohod had kidnapped gangster Maroti Nuwah around two months ago at gunpoint. Diwakar too had ensured no other gambling dens came up in his vicinity. Mystery over Salunkhe\u2019s arrest four days ago Nagpur: Swapnil Salunkhe was arrested by Pachpaoli police on June 13 for an offence of assault on cops registered in 2017. He was earlier rounded up by crime branch in January 2017 but was let off after a senior officer intervened. His arrest in the same case one and half years later Salunkhe when there are 11 accused named is baffling. Two more brothers of dreaded gangster Ippa, Naushad and Irshad too are at large in the case. Salunkhe was not on good terms with Vijay Mohod who was murdered on Sunday. The prime suspect in the murder, Abhay Raut, is learnt to be close to Salunkhe.

One new building has also been constructed as per green building norms, and there are plans for 136 new green buildings in the region. PWD chief engineer Ulhas Debadwar told TOI the plan is to convert 1,500 existing government buildings into green buildings in entire state by 2021. \u201cSome 300 buildings were selected in phase-I, of which works on 201 has been completed. Works on remaining buildings are likely to be completed soon. Target is to cover 525 more buildings in phase-II across the state. MoU for phase-II was executed with GRIHA Council in the city recently,\u201d he said. Under PWD-GRIHA green building Initiative, MoU was executed between the two agencies for transforming 300 existing government buildings, including 121 from Vidarbha, into green buildings in January. The team from GRIHA inspected the buildings and suggested the works. Registration of buildings was done in February. PWD completed works on 201, including 80 in Vidarbha, in three months. GRIHA teams conducted inspection and gave ratings this month. PWD superintending engineer Vidyadhar Sardeshmukh told TOI PWD has also started construction of all new government buildings as per green building norms. \u201cTarget is to construct 201 new buildings, including 137 in Vidarbha, as per green building norms. Works on two buildings, of which one in Nagpur division at Chandrapur and other in Pune division, has been completed. We constructed Van Bhavan at Chandrapur under the project and got five-star rating,\u201d he said. Sardeshmukh added the building of Maharashtra National Law University (MNLU) being constructed by PWD near Waranga will be a complete green building. \u201cWe are constructing buildings at GMCH, Mayo Hospital and other locations too with the same concept,\u201d he said. Sardeshmukh said PWD transformed some historic existing buildings like Vidhan Bhavan, Rajbhavan, Ravibhavan, Hyderabad House etc in the city into green buildings under the project. \u201cMain objective is to reduce power and water consumption, ensure safe disposal of sewage and garbage, reduce carbon emissions, conserve environment, and increase life of the structures. We are replacing all lights with LED and laying reflective paint on terrace to reduce power consumption inside the buildings,\u201d he said. Sardeshmukh also said they plan to operate buildings on solar power after getting rating in phase-I. \u201cAlready, tenders for installation of solar power systems on 390 buildings have been floated in the state, of which 40 are in Nagpur division. Solar power systems will be installed in rest houses first like Ravibhavan, MLA Hostel etc in the city,\u201d he said. Sardeshmukh said PWD will save around 2,200MW per annum used in government buildings after completion of phase-I works. GRIHA Council, a not-for-profit society jointly established by the ministry of new and renewable energy, and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) has claimed phase-I works resulted in annual reduction of 2,721 tonne of carbon emissions, which is equivalent to eliminating 600 vehicles from the roads in the state.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time.

Katheria, who is on a tour gathering data throughout the state before a review meeting in August, said it seems there is a need to relook into the figures. Out of the 43, four cases have been registered under Atrocities Act, he said. Charge sheets have been filed in all except four cases, he said.

Katheria expressed concern over the overall condition of SCs in the country.

There are many pockets in which the quotas for jobs or education have not been filled up entirely.\u201d \u201cLast week, a Dalit family was a victim of a political mob violence in West Bengal.

Ganesh Tandulkar, an autorickshaw stand coordinator at Jhansi Rani Chowk, was allegedly hacked to death by a gang of fellow drivers on Saturday. The assailants were apparently enraged that he shielded a man they wanted to eliminate. The incident took place at Udibaba Chowk in MIDC. The MIDC police acted quickly in the Tandulkar murder case, arresting three assailants, Abhijeet Singh, Rakesh Kuryavanshi and Vicky Dabekar. Within hours, 22-year-old Gaurav Nagpure was stabbed to death by his rivals near a community toilet at Gangabai Ghat within the jurisdiction of Kotwali police station. Nagpure was attacked by his neighbours-turned-foe Tejas Bagde, Shoaeb Malik, Bobby Malik and others with sharp weapons over old rivalry. The injured Nagpure was rushed to hospital, where he was declared dead. Later in the evening, city and rural police set off on another chase when news of a murderous assault on gangster Viju Mohod started doing the rounds. Sources in the police said Mohod, who had kidnapped gangster Maroti Nuwa around two months ago, was apparently kidnapped from an eatery by close aides of another gangster, and thrashed up very badly. Staffers from Beltarodi, Nandanvan, and Sakkardara police stations of city, and Kuhi in rural, started a frenetic search to track down more information. Mohod had a dispute with another goon, identified as Amit Bilge, some days back, which was settled at marriage of one Bobby. Despite this, Mohod had been attacked by his rivals, and was in critical condition at hospital when reports last came in. The mastermind of the gang that attacked Mohod had been arrested by Pachpaoli police in an offence registered in 2017. In the same offence, the gangster had been freed even after being nabbed by crime branch, due to alleged political influence and support of a builder. In the Tandulkar murder, police said the assailants wanted to eliminate one Dinesh Pandey, also an autorickshaw driver, to teach him a lesson for confronting them earlier in the day. The three assailants are trying to establish their dominance at the autorickshaw stand, and Pandey had abused Singh in a lighter vein earlier in the day. It\u2019s learnt that Tandulkar, whose cousin is posted at crime branch, too had a wordy duel with Vicky earlier in the day. Later, Pandey and Singh, who were once classmates, exchanged abuse at the autorickshaw stand at Rani Jhansi Chowk. They were separated by Tandulkar before he left to attend a family programme at Timki. In Tandulkar\u2019s absence, Dabekar assaulted Pandey with a sword on his right shoulder. Pandey went to a hospital at Hingna and informed Tandulkar and another autorickshaw driver Chandrakant Bhagwat. Tandulkar and Bhagwat rushed to the hospital, picked up Pandey and dropped him home safely. Some time later, Tandulkar got a call on his cell phone from Kuryavanshi, who summoned him to Udibaba Chowk. Kuryavanshi and Dabekar wanted Tandulkar to call Pandey too at the spot. Tandulkar reached the spot but kept pleading with the assailants to forgive Pandey and forget the incident. As Kuryavanshi and Dabekar started getting aggressive, Tandulkar tried to sneak away in Bhagwat\u2019s autorickshaw. But Kuryavanshi and Dabekar attacked Tandulkar, and while Singh thrashed Tandulkar, Dabekar assaulted him with a sword.

Addressing the annual passing out parade of the final year course of RSS workers on Sunday, Bhagwat said the violence was unacceptable and animosity should have ended with the elections. \u201cEach one should work together for the country\u2019s development,\u201d he said. In his first major public speech after general elections, Bhagwat who made sharp remarks at opposition, however, also cautioned the ruling party against being complacent. Without naming BJP or any other party, he said the \u201cpeople have bought them to power again hoping that certain aspirations which were left out in the last tenure will be met now. So, it is the utmost duty of those in power to live up to the people\u2019s expectations.\u201d \u201cThe public has become wiser these days and does not get carried away by political promises. This time the people have voted cutting across the divides of society,\u201d he said. This year\u2019s annual passing out ceremony of the RSS remained a rather low-key affair with no chief guest from outside the organization sharing the dais. Last year, veteran Congressman and former President Pranab Mukherjee was the chief guest. This had led to a political stir. This time business baron Rata Tata was invited who did not make it to the function. \u201cThe party which has come to power has got a stronger mandate in the fresh tenure. This means the people have reposed higher faith in the party. Some of the promises they had made were kept and some remained to be fulfilled,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems that some have not been able to digest their defeat. Look at what is taking place in Bengal. It is the responsibility of those at the helm to prevent such happenings. Those who have lost should take the defeat sportingly and the winners should also not be taken over by pride,\u201d said Bhagwat. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps the fear of losing the next elections that has led to violence against political workers. After all these are just elections in which parties only compete to win people\u2019s mandate and this is no war where any bloodshed takes place,\u201d he said. Saying that certain elements are trying to divide the nation for their vested interests, Bhagwat said if they succeed, what was achieved after 70 years of Independence would be wiped out soon. He warned the ruling party of the Trojan horse in the hiding. Bhagwat also evoked Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar citing that he had stressed brotherhood was the need of hour to keep the freedom intact. \u201cBoth freedom and equality cannot come in equal measure. To maintain a balance between the two what the country needed was brotherhood,\u201d he said citing Ambedkar.

Officials said the roster was approved by the vice chancellor using his special powers as per the Act. They said government or commissioner\u2019s approval was not required since these posts were not regular. \u201cThe requirement keeps changing every year. Hence government approval is exempted as per a GR,\u201d they said. This is the second year when the NU would be hiring teachers on contractual basis. Last year too, the NU\u2019s move had attracted allegations of malpractices and violation of UGC norms. Though several objections were raised, the top brass went ahead with the appointments. On May 20, in its Board of Deans (BoD) meeting, presided over by pro-VC Pramod Yeole, the university decided to hire 107 teachers on 11-month contract where they would be paid remuneration of Rs24,000/month. The number has gone up by 15 compared to 92 last year. The teachers would work at 40 NU departments and conducted colleges, including Laxminarayan Institute of Technology (LIT), Sheshrao Wankhede BEd College and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Law College. The moratorium on recruitment had been adversely affecting NU\u2019s functioning. NU had received an overwhelming response with over 700 applications of which 432 were found eligible. Despite this, the appointment of 92 teachers last year was delayed by about six months. The actual teaching started from November end and the tenure concluded on April 30. NU officials said that the university was paying the teachers\u2019 salaries from its general funds. Last year, management council members RG Bhoyar and Nitin Kongre had strongly opposed the move citing several shortcomings. They had said they were not against the filling up of 92 posts but only wanted the NU to reconsider its own norms which were in violation of UGC guidelines. The duo of Bhoyar-Kongre ripped apart the committee entrusted with framing the terms and conditions for the appointment and called the entire exercise as big illegality.

A Pakistani terrorist was killed in the encounter. Major Ketan Sharma of 19 Rashtriya Rifles, who died in the Achabal encounter, belonged to Meerut. A police officer said they had found the body of a Pakistani terrorist and seized arms and ammunition from the encounter site. The identity of the slain terrorist was being ascertained. In another attack, at least nine Army soldiers were injured in an IED blast that targeted a security vehicle of 44 RR at Aarihal village in Pulwama on Monday evening. Those injured in the Achabal gunfight and IED blast were rushed to the Army's 92 Base hospital in Srinagar, officials said. In the third attack in 24 hours, terrorists lobbed a grenade at the headquarters of the 180 CRPF battalion camp in Tral sub-district of Pulwama late on Monday evening. The grenade exploded outside the headquarters. No casualties have been reported. The first attack happened on Monday morning when a team of security men was on a cordon-and-search operation in Achabal. Terrorists fired at the team, who then retaliated. In the Pulwama attack, the terrorists after setting off the IED, opened fire at the Army vehicle. \"Initial reports reveal the vehicle suffered extensive damage,\" the official said. Three of the soldiers injured in the blast were said to be serious, sources said. Soon after the attack, Army, police and SOG reinforcements were rushed to the spot and a massive search operation was launched.

For the last over 18 months, Wi-Fi for 30 minutes or up to 200 MB data is being provided free of cost at the 889 access points. But the main service of providing Wi-Fi after 30 minutes or at the end of 200 MB free data by taking charges has not been made operational. NMC sources told TOI Wi-Fi service could not be made completely operational just for want of payment gateway. \u201cNSSCDCL and L&T were supposed to enter into an agreement with a bank for payment gateway. This simple process could not be completed in over 18 months,\u201d sources said. Municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar confirmed that Wi-Fi service was not available after 30 minutes or 200 MB. \u201cI came to know about it recently. I have directed NSSCDCL officials to ensure payment gateway is operational as soon as possible. We will make it operational soon,\u201d he said. Wi-Fi service under Smart and Safe City Project can be beneficial for individuals, institutions and commercial units across the city due to its high speed. An optical fibre cable of 600km has been laid under Smart and Safe City Project. Wi-Fi access points are connected with this network. Therefore, the speed of internet service is 10 MBPS.

Power consumption has reduced by 52.41% even though the project is yet to be completed. NMC said 1.28 lakh of total 1.43 lakh street lights have been converted from sodium vapour to LED. The civic body is planning to finish the work on remaining 15,000 street lights within a month. An NMC official told TOI the power bill for street lights has come down to Rs2.28 crore per month (Rs27.36 crore per annum) from earlier billing of Rs4.35 crore per month (Rs52.20 crore per annum). This is a saving of Rs2.07 crore per month (Rs24.84 crore per annum). \u201cThe power bill will further reduce once the entire project is completed,\u201d he said. NMC has replaced 60 watt sodium vapour bulb with 36 watt LEDs on internal roads, and 60 watt, 105 watt and 120 watt sodium vapour lamps on major roads, squares and playgrounds with 285 watt LEDs. Apart from saving power by conversion into LED, NMC has installed a system where street lights are dimmed by 40% by 10pm and 50% by midnight. This is done automatically. NMC officials added the automatic switch-on and switch-off system will further reduce power consumption of street lights. \u201cUnder the same project, we will install a system to automatically start street lights after sunset and switch-off by sunrise. Also, timings will be set properly in the system,\u201d he said. For decades, street lights have been seen burning well before sunset, especially during summer days, wasting power. The total cost of the LED project is Rs470 crore of which Rs277 crore is for installing LED systems. Also, NMC aims to ensure majority street lights are included in the project. NMC is spending Rs59 crore on infrastructure development, where old power cables and street light poles will be replaced. Also, NMC is spending Rs28 crore for new street light infrastructure on under-construction Inner Ring Road and Metro rail corridors. NMC is executing all these works through eight private companies. It is mandatory for the companies to operate and maintain the street lights for 99 months, for which they will be paid Rs106 crore. With all these works, NMC is confident of proper functioning of street lights. An NMC official said the project will lead to a profit for the civic body. \u201cNMC will get LED street lights, new infrastructure and systems without spending anything. Entire cost of the project will be recovered from savings in power bills and high cost of current annual maintenance,\u201d he said. However, the project has been delayed to some extent due to delays in getting permission from the state government for seeking loans, ongoing works on Inner Ring Road Cement Concrete project, flyovers and Metro Rail. The works to install LED street lights was supposed to be completed by August 2018. NMC has also issued work orders to private companies for operating all these street lights on solar.

The hold-up at state level is because of growing concerns that the state board students will lose out on seats in good colleges because their CBSE counterparts have scored \u2018high marks\u2019 in the board exams. The state education officials have been brainstorming about various options to solve the problem, but so far nothing concrete has been done. Options such as considering only CBSE theory marks and increasing seats for 2019-20 academic session only are being discussed by officials. Academicians feel that this is an unnecessary controversy which is only hurting students. Reena Dargan, principal of Ira International School, said, \u201cFirst of all there is an assumption that CBSE schools have marked the papers leniently, which is incorrect. Everything is done as per the model answer paper. It\u2019s natural for confrontations to happen between two boards but to drag matters into a public forum is not done.\u201d Dilip Bose, general secretary of School Headmasters Charitable Association, said, \u201cThis delay is not only unwarranted but also detrimental for academic future of students. The delay in admission process means delay in wrapping it up. Then automatically, the classes will start late and we will struggle to finish the course on time. And if poor results come then who will be blamed?\u201d. Another senior state board school principal agreed that the issue was being blown out of proportion. \u201cWe had about 15,000-plus seats going vacant in Nagpur last year in Std XI, so why should there be such a hue and cry. There are ample seats available across all streams. There is no logical reason for people to stop the admission process,\u201d she said. In Nagpur, science students usually go by whatever their coaching classes say and take admission there. Even otherwise, in the city, the craze for specific college does not exist. Obscure junior colleges in city are known to have more than double the enrolment of old and \u2018branded\u2019 colleges, simply because of their tie-up with coaching classes. In this scenario, the delay of admission process in Nagpur does not seem logical. An education department employee, who did not wish to be identified, said, \u201cSince we are connected to the same admission software, the rules will have to be the same as well.\u201d If at all the state education officials decide to not consider CBSE\u2019s internal marks for Std XI admissions, then it will be the second major showdown between the two boards. The first was in 2011 when CBSE students who had appeared for the school-based exam in Std X were denied admission in Std XI of the state board junior colleges. At that time, the state board had raised questions about the credibility of school-based exam in which 100% marks were internally evaluated. The controversy ended only after a lobby group from Nagpur, that included parents, a cabinet minister and schools owners sorted out the issue with the then school education minister Rajendra Darda.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Rs250 crore will be pumped in every year. The company, which has been trading in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) since 1995, also got listed at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) last week. The company\u2019s share is now being traded at Rs38.5 with a trading volume of around 3 lakh shares. It has a paid up value of Re 1. Talking to TOI in light of the listing at NSE, chairman Nitin Khara said the company has 196 auto LPG filling stations in different states. There are plans to take it to 500 stations in Nagpur where there are five centres which would be doubled during the expansion drive. Apart from Maharashtra, the company plans to have additional auto LPG stations in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. \u201cThe company already has its presence in most of these states, which would be further strengthened,\u201d said Khara. Apart from the main cities in these states, there are plans to start auto LPG filling centres in tehsils and Tier III towns also. This will happen in Maharashtra, too, he added. Out of the Rs500 crore planned to be invested, Rs300 crore will go into setting up a bottling plant. Confidence Petroleum is at present a debt free company and would be funding it expansion through internal accruals apart from raising loans. On the listing at NSE he said it was pending because shares which formed a major stake held in his mother\u2019s name remained in physical form. Khara said that as his mother expired in 2011, it took time to settle the formalities related to the will after which the shares held in her name were dematised.

Thus, in real sense, the project might be fully operational only in 2021. A source in MahaMetro said work on many stations was stuck due to land acquisition problems. \"In the Sitabuldi to Khapri stretch, Ujjwal Nagar station is in trouble as land required on one side is stuck in litigation. Five stations are already operational on this reach while the remaining five will be gradually opened for the public by this year-end,\" he added. MahaMetro\u2019s station contractor for this reach \u2014 ILFS \u2014 has gone bust leaving the work in limbo. The contracts were retendered and now work is on in full swing again. On Prajapati Nagar to Sitabuldi stretch, Prajapati Nagar station itself is stuck as the owner of Rehana Steel, whose land is required, is demanding a higher amount than that fixed by the district collector. \"Negotiations are going on and we are trying to persuade the owner not to ask for a higher price,\" said the source. In general, work of this stretch (Reach IV) has been affected due to labour shortage. \"Over 70% of construction workers employed for this reach are from outside. They had gone to their native villages to vote, and have started returning only just now. Work will begin in full swing only after some weeks when all of them are back on the job,\" the official said. The entire Reach II (Sitabuldi to Automotive Square stretch) is stuck since National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is yet to sanction the double decker flyover on this stretch. The flyover was to begin from a point near SFS Church but due to opposition from locals it has been moved to LIC Square. However, four multi-storied buildings have to be acquired for it now. \"We have stopped the work of most stations on Reach II as there is no clarity on the flyover. Work will begin only after NHAI gives the green signal,\" the source said. In addition, two stations have land problems too. \"The owners of land on one side of Automotive Square station are not willing to hand it over.

He brightened the lives of 400-450 villagers by bringing water to their doorstep at a time when the nearest \u2018nullah\u2019 outside the hamlet and a rickety hand pump both had gone dry in the harsh summer this year. Within a fortnight of Balkawade\u2019s visit to Katejhari on May 29, two bore wells were dug at the village and a storage tank constructed. Around 20-22 taps, installed at intermittent distances, would now get water. Though his original mission was to visit the highly sensitive Katejhari village to meet family members of a Maoist and also the villagers, the district police chief won the hearts of the villagers with his water diplomacy. The village is known for its outright support for Maoists. But Balkawade proved that anti-Maoist operations need not always be with guns and grenades. The project, funded under the civic action programme of cops, turned out to be such a big occasion that the villagers wanted it to be inaugurated quickly. Instead of any officer or politician, it was one of the villagers, Bhimaji Kolhe, who inaugurated the water project on Friday. While Kolhe did the honours, the officers of Katejhari armed out post (AOP) sub-inspectors Akshaykumar Gorad, Sagar Warute and Jagannath Menkudle were cheering the event. Balkawade said he had gone to Katejhari to convince the family of a Maoist to surrender under the \u2018Navjeevan' programme and also meet the villagers under \u2018grambhet\u2019 (village meet) to ask them about their grievances. \u201cIt was when I had just started to come back that some women and children approached me with two things. One, they had mentioned about drinking water problem and the other one was the deplorable condition of the Katejhari-Murumgaon road which is riddled with trenches and big pot holes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem of drinking water was solved within a short period and now we are also pushing for the repair of the connecting road through our special funds. Providing drinking water was our priority as there was no provision available from where the villagers could draw water and given the heat their lives seemed to have become very tough in that dry terrain,\u201d said the Balkawade.

While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The e-buses, which will be pink in colour, will ferry women passengers only. The buses will be added to NMC\u2019s Aapli Bus fleet by July end, said transport committee chairman Bunty Kukde. The 32-seater midi bus will cost around Rs 1.29 crore each. The civic body had received Rs9.60 crore grant from the state government to ply women-only buses under Tejaswani Scheme. Kukde said earlier the civic body had decided to purchase diesel buses, but later decided to purchase electric buses as it will reduce the expenditure substantially and will cause no pollution. Currently, the NMC is plying 328 buses and has no women-only buses. It was a long-pending demand from women commuters to operate special buses for them. Sources said the NMC had received funds from the state government in early 2017. But the civic administration had exhausted the funds. Following directives from Kukde, the administration has made financial provision for electric buses. Kukde said the NMC has started the process to set up a charging station at NMC\u2019s land on old Bhandara Road in Lakadganj area. The charging station can accommodate three buses at a time. Each bus needs three hours for charging and can run for almost 200km. According to Kukde, a bus will consume a unit to run a kilometre. This will curb NMC\u2019s expenditure on city bus transportation significantly as the costing of one unit of power is around Rs12.

He is the third minister from the district after the CM and energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule. He has been allocated the public works, tribal development and forest portfolios. Although Fuke will be a minister only till October, when assembly elections are scheduled, this appointment brightens his chance of becoming a minister in the new government should BJP-Shiv Sena retain power. Fuke started his political journey in 2007 when he was elected as an independent corporator. Between 2007 and 2012, he was in the opposition benches. However, he continued his close relationship with Fadnavis, who was then just a BJP MLA. After winning the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) election second time in 2012 he moved closer to BJP by joining the saffron party led Nagpur Vikas Aghadi. In 2016 he formally joined BJP and contested the legislative council elections from Bhandara-Gondia local body seat. He soundly defeated Rajendra Jain, a close aide of NCP stalwart Praful Patel. He managed to get a BJP ticket for NMC elections in 2017 and ensured his victory. Even though Fuke joined BJP in 2016 he was closely associated with Fadnavis since years. He help the CM during Vidhan Sabha elections in 2009 and 2014. Even while in the opposition in NMC, he rarely took an antigovernment stand and was considered to be a neutral. Fuke\u2019s career in BJP received a boost when the then MP Nana Patole from Bhandara-Gondia quit the party in 2017 and joined Congress. The MLC emerged from Patole\u2019s shadow to become a prominent leader in the two districts. The MLC had to bite dust when BJP lost the Lok Sabha assembly election from the constituency in May 2018. Patole and Patel had joined hands in the bypoll to ensure victory of their candidate Madhukar Kukde. Fuke however, did not lose heart and along with Bawankule he charged up the party workers for the general elections. Most political pundits felt that NCP would win from Bhandara-Gondia as BJP had lost the bypoll. However, the saffron candidate Sunil Mendhe won by 1.97 lakh votes giving a big boost to Fuke\u2019s career. In fact Fuke had been offered the ticket but he refused. Fuke\u2019s close association with TOI-MT Parinay Fuke was closely associated with TOI-MT during the Nag River campaign. He tabled a proposal in NMC House to name the square near TOI-MT office as \u2018Times Square\u2019. He then followed up with the administration to ensure that the proposal was implemented. Fuke got the road divider from Times Square to Laxmi Bhuvan Square painted and repaired the Nag River wall near TOI-MT office. He also helped the Group during its \u2018Happy Streets\u2019 event.

In what it calls to be a civil disobedience movement of its kind, the Sangathana has been pressing for free access to technology in agriculture including mass use of GM seeds. The HT seeds that have been developed by American biotech giant Monsanto are resistant to herbicides (weed killers), which have glyphosate as a key ingredient. Even the glyphosate-based herbicide has been developed by Monsanto. Shetkari Sangathana has been demanding that the government should allow use of HT seeds, as it will help them save a major cost on removal of weeds by deploying manual labour. However, experts say even if the seeds are allowed, cotton farmers may not be able to use HT variety legally. Former director of Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) Keshav Kranthi said that this is because glyphosate-based herbicide are only recommended for use in teal plantations and barren land. Without being allowed to use glyphosate, HT seeds not be of any use to the cotton grower. Kranthi now heads the technical section of International Cotton Advisory Council in the US. In its comment to an earlier report carried by TOI, even Monsanto had said, \u201cIn India, glyphosate-based herbicides have been recommended for use in general weed control in non-cropped areas such as tea and pre-plant rice. It should be used only as per the recommended guidelines.\u201d Anil Ghanawat, President of Shetkari Sangathana, however said that glyphosate is non-selective herbicide and can also be used on the cotton crop. Shetkari Sangathana had started its campaign last week from Akoli Jahangir village of Akola district where farmer Lalit Bahale planted the seeds in front of police and 1,200 other farmers. If proven, this can lead to a five-year sentence. After that, farmers in districts like Wardha, Dhule and Ahmednagar have planted the seeds. This would be followed by farmers in Parbhani and Amravati. The declaration form prepared by the Sangathana will have details like farmers\u2019 name, village and the area in which the seed has been planted. Shetkari Sangathana has been pressing that the government should allow use of HT seeds. However, after the trials, Monsanto itself had withdrawn its application in 2016. On this, Ghanawat said it was due to the low royalty it would have got on the seeds. \u201cThe Sangathana demands that the government should not intervene in the prices and give the technology provider a free hand letting the market decide the price,\u201d he said.

The accused have been identified as Mujahid Ahmed Ashraf, the alleged kingpin, and Imran Dalla. Police nabbed the duo and seized 55 grams of Mephedrone commonly known as \u2018MD\u2019 in the wee hours of Friday at Gittikhadan. Besides the drugs, police have also a car, in all worth Rs9.65 lakh. The cops had received a tip-off about two men, having a huge consignment of MD drug, waiting in a car at Gittikhadan for delivery. Police raided the spot and nabbed the accused. It is learnt that since the mastermind of the racket Feroze Khan alias Abu was nabbed and sent to jail, Mujahid had taken over the business. However, he was selling the drug to consumers by ditching the middle men due to which the cops were having a hard time nabbing him. The anti-narcotics cell, under the guidance of PI RD Nikam, nabbed them. It is learnt that Mujahid had been selling the drug to several high-profile clients.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The move is likely to create a controversy at the civic body. In its June 12 issue, TOI had reported that NSWPMPL, a company incorporated by the Noida-based Essel Infraprojects Limited and Japan-based Hitachi Zosan India Private Ltd brought a garbage segregation machine instead of installing the Waste to Energy Plant at the Bhandewadi dumping yard raising doubts whether the company will develop the city\u2019s project or not.

In line with a nationwide strike called by Indian Medical Association (IMA), most doctors kept Outdoor Patient Departments (OPDs) of their hospitals closed for the day. Only emergency services and casualty wards were functioning. Diagnostic services and pathologies were also closed for the day. Doctors practicing ayurveda, homeopathy and other schools of medicines also kept their clinics closed to express solidarity with their counterparts practicing allopathy. While private doctors observed the strike, residents as well as senior doctors at Government Medical Colleges across the region worked with black ribbons on their hands. Nagpur, being a medical hub in Central India, receives patients from nearby areas of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Many patients coming from the rural parts of these states had to spend the day waiting in hospitals due to the strike. Emergency cases were given due attention and admitted to CCUs. \u201cSix emergency cases were admitted in Critical Care Unit (CCU) on Monday. Our intentions were clear that patients should not suffer due to our agitation. Patients who came for routine check-ups were given alternative appointments promptly,\u201d said Dr Anoop Marar, director of Orange City Hospital and Research Center. Paediatrician Dr Uday Bodhankar said that cases coming from faraway places were treated. \u201cPeople from other states come with serious cases to Nagpur. Moreover, paediatric cases are vulnerable and we cannot avoid them. So, several cases were treated, and many patients were admitted,\u201d he said. Nagpur IMA president Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala said doctors registered protest peacefully without creating problems for patients. \u201cThe one-day strike was peaceful. We made patients aware about the tough situation doctors face when patients\u2019 relatives take law in their hands. Services will resume from Tuesday morning, and patients earlier scheduled for check-ups on Monday will be given priority,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, members of IMA gathered at the IMA Hall on Monday morning, raised slogans and highlighted placards against the West Bengal government. \u201cDoctors usually do not stretch the agitations so long. We are there to serve the people. But the attitude of the state\u2019s chief minister was very disappointing. So, we had to take a stand nationwide,\u201d said Dr Sanjay Deshpande. Even as OPDs were shut, doctors kept hospitals and waiting areas open for patients. Hospital staff told them about the strike and arranged for alternate appointments. On Monday evening, resident doctors in West Bengal called off their strike as their negotiations with the state government were successful. IMA central committee will issue directives about the future course of action to local units on Tuesday.

Plan could have materialized if Scania had agreed to sell buses at depreciated value,\u201d the sources said. In an another shocker for NMC, Scania has gone in for arbitration. Before discontinuing the service, Scania had filed a petition in the district court and succeeded in getting an order to restrict NMC from forfeiting its bank guarantee of Rs 7.50 crore. NMC then began efforts for a settlement. Scania had demanded payment with GST which the NMC refused. Therefore, NMC did not pay anything to Scania from July 1, 2017, till termination. NMC was confident of resolving payment issues with Scania as well as resume the service.

He was sent to magisterial custody on June 15 by the court. Salunkhe, earlier an accused in a murder where Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA) was invoked, is learnt to be a close associate of dreaded Ippa gang. He had been booked in a case of assault on cops in an incident of December 26 in 2017. The offence against Salunkhe and 10 others, including gangster Ippa\u2019s brothers Naushad and Irshad, was registered at Pachpaoli police station. On December 26, 2017, cops had gone to arrest members of the Ippa gang near the railway tracks adjoining Nova Company at Motibagh in connection with a case of attempt to murder registered at Tehsil police station for attacking a rival the previous day. The gangsters had managed to flee after showering bricks on crime branch cops and also damaging their vehicle. MCOCA was invoked against the Ippa gang in the offence registered at Tehsil police station but questionable intervention of senior officers led to removal of a goon\u2019s name from the charge sheet. The goon\u2019s kin is allegedly close to a senior politician from city. Salunkhe was rounded up by crime branch\u2019s unit number three and taken to their Lakdapool police chowky in January last year. Unconfirmed sources claimed that while recording his statement crime branch officials received a call from a top police officer. After this Salunkhe was been let off. A senior IPS officer had told TOI that Salunkhe was not present at the site as per his cell phone location and other evidence, which prompted the decision to let him go from custody. After that, police have till date been unable to trace the Ippa brothers Naushad and Irshad. Salunkhe too had been let off.

She contributed Rs51,000 from the benefits she got from the department to ensure a room was erected for women colleagues. A rest room for women cops at the police station struck Hemlata as one of the biggest requirements, to ensure they have a place for a breather in between strenuous working schedule at odd hours. Hemlata had worked the night shift continuously for five years, to ensure her only son Dhruv\u2019s upbringing was not affected, as her husband Deepak worked at a central government office in regular office hours. In fact, it was Deepak\u2019s transfer to Gujarat that prompted Hemlata to quit and follow him there. \u201cI worked in the night and looked after my son in the day time when my husband was at office. One of us had to sacrifice for our son\u2019s sake. We could compromise on everything but not on the son\u2019s upbringing,\u201d she said. \u201cAt times, I used to look around the police station in the wee hours of the day, trying to find a corner to just lay down for a while out of exhaustion,\u201d she said, \u201cSometimes even a woman complainant would land up at odd hours with children in tow, and have nowhere to go.\u201d \u201cI hope my contribution will help my women colleagues rest and also change in case they get drenched in rain or something,\u201d she said. Hemlata\u2019s send-off also had a different hue as it was held, upon her insistence, at the Government Observation Home for children at Patankar Chowk on June 14, and not at the police station as usual. Hemlata\u2019s gifted clothes to the underprivileged inmates, and complete sets of books and stationary to two students of standards X and IX. Hemlata\u2019s decision lit up the lives of the inmates of the government home for one day, as Jaripatka police too turned it into an \u2018Eid milan\u2019, distributing \u2018Sheer kurma\u2019 to all. Hemlata, who joined the police department 21 years and six months ago, has always celebrated special moments at places like old age homes and orphanages, whether birthdays or anniversaries. \u201cIt brings special happiness if shared with people who need love and care more than others,\u201d said Hemlata. Helping children too is nothing new too for Hemlata, something she had been doing as a cop too. \u201cI had taken several abandoned and unattended children to safe shelters.

On Tuesday itself a gypsy broke down during the evening safari, forcing a tourist to walk 4km inside the core jungle. Forest officials are exploring options of negotiating a good deal with banks or getting funds through some government scheme. Poonam Pate, NNTR deputy director (core) said, \u201cWe are trying to see if a discounted rate of interest can be negotiated for vehicle loans. They did a similar thing in Tadoba and we are trying to work along the same route.\u201d Another option for the forest officials is to dip into funds from some state or central government scheme. \u201cThat option is at a very preliminary stage and a bit of a remote possibility for now. But we are trying to find out if there is some kind of scheme where we can access funds for new vehicles,\u201d said Pate. There are 43 vehicles plying in NNTR with a majority of them in bad shape. Many consider it a miracle that these vehicles don\u2019t break down as often as they should. While pulling the plug on all these vehicles may seem the logical thing to do, forest officials say the solution isn\u2019t practical. \u201cThis would mean taking away employment opportunities from villagers who reside here. They are not in a position to invest their own money to buy new vehicles. In fact, some of them may not even be in a position to get it financed either. These are ground realities that one needs to keep in mind before taking any decision and that is why we are exploring options to help them,\u201d said Pate. Maintenance of vehicles to prolong their life is also out of the question at this point of time. Sources say these vehicles are literally running on \u2018prayers\u2019 and there is no scope for any kind of mechanical intervention to salvage the vehicles.

The play dates back to 1947 when people began to see the sun of freedom approaching, but the cost and consequences of it were still unknown. The decision of the British Raj to divide India shattered the lives of many, causing the biggest migration ever happened in history. The drama revolves around Baandish, the central character of the play, who is a Sikh living in undivided India (which is now in Pakistan) and his struggle while migrating from his land, leaving behind his memories, childhood, dreams, and his mother. The actors effectively portrayed the pain and sufferings of the people with throbbing performances and top notch acting. The play offered a glimpse into undivided India by showcasing brotherhood among Hindu-Muslims, love for each other\u2019s traditions, lifestyle and religious beliefs. The decision to divide the country pitted these two communities against each other. The Punjabi attire of characters, old household set-up, precision of dialogues and quality of expression made the play a treat to the eyes of spectators. The concluding part of the play which showcased the dark side of partition, resulting into mass deaths, poverty, unhygienic conditions and emotional baggage of leaving behind their homes, touched the audience. A scene in the play shows a young boy, playing with his grandfather, asks him, \u201cWho lives on that side of the border Dadu?

He took the help of historical events like the American Civil War to explain his points as he went deeper into the subject. \u201cThe American Civil War was one of the greatest moral, constitutional and economic crisis in the world.

Because all men were considered equal except for South American men.\u201d Pandey said, \u201cLincoln effectively addressed many problems in the world including inequality among men.\u201d Picking up the topic right where Pandey left it, Mubarak Syed, \u201cPeople often ask me why I chose to become a teacher to which I reply that it was never my choice.

Nagpur traffic police are now suspending driving licences of such offenders. In the five months this year, the traffic police have asked regional transport office (RTO) to suspend driving licences of 2,425 violators. These are for violations like over speeding, using mobile phones, carrying passengers in goods vehicles, signal jumping, drunken drive and unruly behaviour by autorickshaw drivers. Traffic police seized the licences and sent them to RTO for suspension between January 1 and May 31, 2019. In this period traffic police booked 34,625 drivers under these offences. So they have recommended suspension of licences for 7% drivers only. Traffic Police initially only seized licences of repeat offenders but now even first-time offenders will have their licences taken away for at least three months. The traffic police term this change a \u201csilent revolution\u201d. \u201cGiven that around 20 lakh vehicles ply on Nagpur\u2019s roads, we have kept one in 10 drivers away from the wheels for at least three months,\u201d a senior officer from the traffic branch said. According to the officer, Traffic Police had been recommending the cancellation of driving licences for a long time as per Motor Vehicles Act Sections 19 and 21, but it was nowhere close to the scale it is today. \u201cWe were cautious in implementing the stringent rule. We did it only in case of repeat offenders,\u201d the officer claimed. The officer also pointed out that even a Supreme Court-appointed committee had issued directions to seize driving licences for five grave traffic violations speeding, signal jumping, drunk driving, use of mobile phones while driving and carrying passengers in goods vehicles. According to data from traffic branch, driving licences of 1,494 people were suspended for driving under the influence of liquor, while licences of 397 have been suspended for jumping signals and 311 for using mobile phones while driving. Traffic experts called it a welcome step. They admitted lack of enforcement in city had increased violations manifold. Suspending licence was far more stringent move than simply paying a few hundred rupees and getting away, experts added. They pointed the traffic police needed to make people aware of their new stance.

While 50% seats were already reserved under different categories, the introduction of 16% SEBC, 10% EWS and 5% has increased the total quota further. These students would also be allowed to apply under the remaining 19% seats in the open category. The staggering quota percentage may not have an impact on admissions to humanities and commerce faculty courses but it can greatly impact the prospects for open category in the science stream. During the 2018-19 academic session, MSc courses had received an overwhelming response with 3,764 applying for 1,966 seats while MA courses had got only 3,704 applications against intake of 13,016. The vacant seats under a particular quota would be transferred to another reserved category. The online CAP is applicable to all the 38 NU departments, and over 100 affiliated colleges for non-professional courses where admissions are not done by any other government agency. The number of seats in science faculty are likely to be same while humanities and commerce may see a drop due of ban on admission to 80 colleges. As of now, admissions to seven PG courses have opened while rest would be added when final-year UG results are declared. The NU had held back the announcement for the last 15 days mainly due to lack of guidelines on seat allocation under the new quotas from the government which has found itself in a tight spot over PG medical and dental admissions. While students were demanding release of the CAP schedule in June first week to ensure academic schedule compliance, colleges apprehended loss of admissions due to the delay. In phase-I, admissions to just seven courses have been announced. These are the same courses which were chosen for the pilot CAP last year when the process had kicked off in May last week itself. Last year, the CAP had begun on June 1 but dragged on till late September, just 15 days before the first semester exams, because of several anomalies, backlog students qualifying at the eleventh hour and colleges getting late permissions to admit students. The NU has started a separate portal for these admissions and students\u2019 facilitation centres would be opened at several colleges besides at NU\u2019s Amravati Road campus. The NU has already uploaded free of cost brochure carrying all the details of CAP process, intake capacity and course fee. There would be two CAP rounds on merit basis followed by third, if needed, for management seats.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

The child was seriously injured and is undergoing treatment at Arvi general hospital. Police arrested the accused on Sunday. Accused Umesh alias Amol Dhore (32) and victim Aryan Khadse (8) are residents of Rani Laxmi Bai ward of Arvi. Aryan was playing in the Jogona Mata temple premises, as he usually does in the afternoon, on Saturday. Dhore suspected that Aryan had stolen some coins from the temple. To punish Aryan, Dhore tied his hands and forced him to sit on the hot tiles in the temple yard. Aryan suffered burn injuries on his buttocks. When Aryan\u2019s father Gajanan Khadse came to know about the incident, he lodged a police complaint against Dhore\u2019s action at Arvi police station on Saturday night. A case has been registered under Prevention of Atrocities Act at Arvi police station. The victim belongs to Matang community, which is considered as dalit.

Nadda's appointment as working president was on the cards after he was not inducted into the government. Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Congratulations to him on becoming the working president of the party,\" the Prime Minister added. Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president. Nadda has long experience of the party organisation as he was the in-charge of the party headquarters and is a popular figure.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition.

Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

This too is subject to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) clearing the Kamptee Road stretch within a few days. MahaMetro has to construct a double decker flyover from Gaddigodam to Automotive Square. The starting point of the flyover is a bone of contention with the locals opposing the initial location. MahaMetro decided to shift it to LIC Square but NHAI has put a rider that it needs 5.5 metre wide service road. The Metro agency will have to demolish four multi-storied buildings for this. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari has been approached to sort out the issue. The agency does not agree that it is a delay. \u201cAs per the detailed project report (DPR), the project is to be completed in five years from the date of beginning of construction. Work on the project began on May 31, 2015. So we have time till June, 2020,\u201d said a spokesperson. As on date, only one out of the four reaches is operational, that too not fully. Only five out of 11 stations are operating on Sitabuldi-Khapri stretch (Reach I). Only six trains each are plying in both directions on this route. According to MahaMetro spokesperson, frequency of trains on Reach I will increase this month. \u201cWe successfully tested the down line of Reach I on June 4. Now, trains will run on both up and down lines. Moreover, 15 more coaches are slated to reach Nagpur this month. We will be able to run more trains gradually,\u201d he said. As for remaining six stations of Reach I \u2014 Congress Nagar, Rahate Colony, Ajni Square, Jaiprakash Nagar, Chhatrapati Nagar and Ujjwal Nagar \u2014 all of them will be operational by the year end. This will be a gradual process, he added. MahaMetro is supposed to launch a common mobility card for Metro, city buses, feeder vehicles, autorickshaws etc. However, so far the card \u2014 Mahacard \u2014 has been launched with limited features, for travelling in Nagpur Metro only. It has been distributed among commuters. As the Mahacard is EMV (Europay, Mastercard and Visa) based bank card it has to pass through extensive internal testing, third party audit and security review. \u201cMahaMetro is in touch with State Bank of India (SBI) and as per the current planning and discussions, the card is expected to be launched within a month or so,\u201d said the spokesperson. The feeder services are yet to start fully. The operator for the service of bicycles, e-bicycles and e-scooters is Wicked Ride Adventure Services (Bounce). The service has been started on monthly subscription basis. The e-scooter service will start after getting permission from the state transport department. Feeder buses have been started by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) for some stations. According to the spokesperson, hundreds of people working in Mihan live in Besa-Beltarodi. \u201cNMC runs buses from Besa to Airport South and then from Khapri to Mihan. City bus and Metro timetables have been displayed on company notice boards,\u201d he said. There are very few amenities at the Metro stations. The spokesperson said that tenders for small business spaces at Airport, Khapri and Jaiprakash Nagar stations have been floated and necessary services would be available after the process was completed. Khapri and New Airport stations lack approach roads. According to the spokesperson approach road to them is available at Mihan end but these are not tarred roads and in very bad shape. \u201cApproach road to New Airport station from Wardha Road side will be ready in a couple of months,\u201d he added. Next in the pipeline is commercial operation of Reach III. Work on the entire stretch will be over by July end and trains will start plying in August. Here too only five stations will operate initially \u2014 Lokmanya Nagar, Subhash Nagar, Institution of Engineers, Rani Jhansi Square and Sitabuldi Interchange. The remaining stations will be opened up one after another in six to seven months. Reach II (Sitabuldi to Automotive Square) and Reach IV (Sitabuldi to Prajapati Nagar) will be completed in the first quarter of 2020. Work on Reach II is 50% complete, piling work 96%, pile cap 85%, pier 76%, segment casting 33% and Metro station work 54%. Girder launching is progressing. Work on Reach IV is also 50% complete. According to MahaMetro the viaduct is 67% complete, pilling 97%, pile cap 95%, pier 76%, segment casting 78% and segment erection 63% has been completed. Contractors were supposed to finish the work by December 2019. However, this is not happening. On whether they will be penalized, the spokesperson said, \u201cEntire Reach II is stuck up due to NHAI.

At Arvi, the Bhim Tiger Sena (BTS) demanded stringent action against the accused, and handed over a memorandum to district collector and sub-divisional office on Monday. The incident has been condemned by many organizations on social media too. Aryan Khadse, 8, a resident of Rani Laxmibai Ward of Arvi town, was accused of stealing some coins from a temple by accused Umesh alias Amol Dhore. The accused punished Aryan by forcing him to sit on hot tiles on Saturday afternoon, which caused serious burn injuries on his buttocks. Aryan is admitted at Arvi general hospital. On Monday, the state office of the NSSC, at Pune, wrote to the Wardha collector and superintendent of police, asking for a report on the incident.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

The cops had registered an offence against the accused under lighter sections until they received a directive from district collector Ashwin Mudgal. Naib tehsildar Sunil Salve and six others had gone to Kharbi-Wathoda Ring Road on April 23 morning to check illegal transport of sand. Two trucks bearing registration numbers MH-40-AK 8056 and MH-36-F 4157 were stopped and the sand being transported by them was inspected. According to preliminary estimates they were carrying about six brass of sand. At around 8.30am, a Mercedes Benz car (MH-41-AA-8100) coming from the wrong side tried to run over Salve and circle officer HP Maliye. The two truck drivers refused to produce any documents regarding sand transport and verbally abused the team members. The drivers threatened the officials with dire consequences. The Mercedes driver also asked the two truck drivers to flee from the spot. When the revenue officials tried to pursue them, they fled in three different directions. The revenue officials then went to Nandanvan police station and met PI Vinayak Chavhan. The cops only registered offences under Sections 353 and 34 of IPC (creating obstacle in government work).
