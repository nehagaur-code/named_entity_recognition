If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

It has been observed in Bihar that many landowners do not cultivate themselves and instead give their land to other farmers under lease or sharecropping. The Bihar government is providing financial assistance to the raiyat and non-raiyat farmers equally in all the important schemes related to agriculture, especially diesel subsidy, agricultural input and Bihar Rajya Fasal Sahayata Yojna. In this perspective, we suggest that non-raiyat farmers should also be included under the Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana,\u201d the CM said. Making a strong pitch for discontinuing the centrally sponsored schemes, Nitish said the existing CSS is putting extra burden on the state\u2019s exchequer due to recent changes in financing ratio between the Centre and the state as well as reduction in the Union government\u2019s contribution in the CSS. \u201cIn some of the centrally sponsored schemes, the contribution of the central Government has been reduced to 50%. Due to this change in the financial pattern, Bihar government had to spend Rs 4,500 crore in the financial year 2015-16, Rs 4,900 crore in 2016-17, Rs 15,335 crore in 2017-18 and Rs 21,396 crore in 2018-19 from its own resources in the centrally sponsored schemes. As a result, Bihar is not in a position to meet its priorities of entitlement-based public amenities and other requirements,\u201d Nitish argued. Batting for special category status, Nitish said it would enhance the central government\u2019s share in the centrally sponsored schemes on one hand and provide an opportunity to the states to utilize their resources in other development and welfare schemes on the other. Nitish also requested the Centre that the ceiling of 25% of the State Disaster Response Fund for providing gratuitous relief grant be relaxed and Bihar should be given the funds meant for gratuitous relief grant as per the need of the state as it was available prior to 2015.

The meteorological centre has predicted the maximum temperature to hover in the range of 42- 44 degrees C till June 22. \u201cJune and July normally witness the hottest days of the year across the globe as the distance between the Sun and Earth is the least at this time of the year. The solar rays thus penetrate straight to the lowest level of atmosphere. Besides, the hot and dry westerly winds blowing in the region are intensifying the heat,\u201d a senior Patna Met centre official said. Weathermen, however, expect a slight respite from the scorching heat, as the local Met office has issued a forecast of generally cloudy sky with possibility of rain or thunderstorm in the state capital on June 21 and 22. The officials attributed it to pre-monsoon showers. \u201cExcessive heating at this time of the year leads to formation of low- pressure area, which in turn, leads to pre- monsoon thundershowers. Such thundershowers do not last long and subside within 30 minutes or an hour,\u201d said a senior official at Patna meteorological centre. Pre-monsoon showers apart, the southwest monsoon made progress over north-eastern and eastern India on the second consecutive day on Sunday. An all-India daily weather bulletin issued by IMD stated that southwest monsoon further advanced into most parts of northeast India and some parts of north Bengal and Sikkim. However, senior officials at Patna centre claimed that monsoon is unlikely to hit Bihar before June 25, making a delay of nearly a fortnight from its normal onset date in the state. The rain-bearing winds normally enter Bihar through the north- eastern districts of Purnea and Kishanganj around June 10-12.

The West Bengal doctors are already on strike demanding fulfilment of their demands, including the arrest of the accused who had grievously injured two doctors and rolling out a stern central law for doctors\u2019 protection. However, keeping the grievous situation due to the increasing number of patients suffering from Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) in several north Bihar districts, the paediatric department at Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) and Sadar hospital at Muzaffarpur have been exempted from the strike. IMA\u2019s Bihar chapter president-elect Dr Bimal Karak said the lack of infrastructure and unavailability of required count of doctors in government hospitals and no action plan on the part of the government leading to more than 90 deaths due to AES in Muzaffarpur till now are additional factors in Bihar for going on strike. Doctors under the aegis of Bihar State Health Services Association have also extended their support to the strike called by IMA, Dr Karak said. In a press release, the State Health Services Association has said the routine work at outpatient departments of hospitals and health centres would be boycotted in support of the IMA\u2019s call. However, doctors would remain on duty in paediatrics department, emergency services and postmortem across the state. Dr Karak said a central team of doctors as well as AIIMS-Patna director Dr P K Singh had clearly said a strong government action plan was required to save the lives from AES in state, which claim so many lives every year. \u201cWhile the AES has spread to Samastipur and Vaishali too, more than 50 died of heatstroke.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Both are supposed to be \u2018sunrise\u2019 courses elsewhere, but there are no takers in PU. Some other self-financing courses, too, have failed to attract the minimum desired number of applicants in order to sustain. For instance, PG diploma course in applied criminology has got only one application, while PG diploma in remote sensing and GIS could get only three. PG diploma in financial services and MA in women\u2019s studies also received seven and eight applications respectively. The department heads running these courses would have hard nuts to crack owing to their economic non-viability. As neither the state government nor the university provides any financial assistance, the courses would have to be discontinued, said a senior academic. In regular (conventional) PG courses, the number of applications received for admission to MA, MSc and MCom are 3523, 2803 and 1184 respectively. Since admission to these courses would be made on the basis of marks obtained in the last qualifying examination, the list of candidates selected for admission as per reservation roster would be published on June 20 onward. Meanwhile, PU has opened its online admission portal once again for seeking fresh choice of reservation (10%) from general category students from economically weaker sections for admission to undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Economically weak students from general category can indicate their choice for 10% reservation till June 18. PU had already conducted the centralized entrance test for admission to the Degree Part I honours courses in arts, science and commerce streams, but withheld publication of results due to receipt of a directive from the state education department for implementing the new provision of 10% reservation for the poor general category students from the current session itself.

Mishra was speaking at the inaugural session of the two-day national seminar on \u2018Probation: Relevancy, opportunity and challenges\u2019, which was inaugurated by law minister Narendra Narayan Yadav on the premises of Bihar Institute of Correctional Administration (BICA) at Hajipur in Vaishali district on Saturday. The seminar is being attended by more than 20 probation officers from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Delhi and some other states. Altogether 74 probation officers and superintendents of eight central jails in Bihar are also attending the seminar. Mishra laid emphasis on strengthening the probation system to make it more effective so that that the first-time offenders committing petty offences can be stopped from turning into repeated offenders. He also emphasised on the effective use of probation officers in the state. Courts depend on confidential report of probation officers which is prepared on the basis of offender\u2019s locality, environment around him, family and few other factors for allowing such offenders to settle back instead of throwing them behind bars. The Centre had rolled out Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 so that first-time offenders could be saved from becoming repeated offenders. The Bihar government had brought Probation of Offenders Rules in 1958. The participants were also told about the Patna high court judgment delivered in Upendra Nath Chaudhary case in 2007 in which the court had ruled that lower courts are bound to seriously consider report of probation officers for rehabilitating first-time offenders. The provision in the Act states that a first-time offender between age group of 18 and 21 years, who had committed any petty crime attracting imprisonment of less than seven years, is brought back into the mainstream of the society instead of throwing them behind bars and turning them into habitual offenders. The state currently has working strength of 107 probation officers against the sanctioned strength of 145. The officers belong to Bihar Probation Service. It is on the basis of a probation officer\u2019s report that an inmate is released on parole or his sentence is remitted.

Excerpts: So far 68 deaths of minor children have been reported, officially. What steps have been taken to check the spread of the deadly disease?The state government is serious on the issue and making all out efforts to contain the disease. In fact, it\u2019s a viral disease, which can be contained with awareness among parents of minor children. The awareness campaign has been launched in the worst affected villages and parents have been advised to follow certain guidelines issued by the doctors. ANMs and anganwadi workers have also been pressed into service. The affected children are being provided the best possible treatment. Though the reports of death of children started pouring in from mid-May, you took almost a month to visit the affected areas to take stock of situation. What\u2019s reason for your delayed visit?It\u2019s not true. The health department officials were keeping a tab on development ever since the first case of suspected AES was reported in January. In fact, number of patients suddenly increased after June 2. Arrangements were made to accommodate patients at the SKMCH-Muzaffapur and number of beds and PICUs was also increased. I was on a foreign tour during that period. But I was in constant touch with officials of my department and used to get updates from them. I met Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan in New Delhi and apprised him of the situation. Subsequently, a central team of medical experts visited Muzaffarpur. I too went to the SKMCH and met relatives of the patients. Why the mortality rate in government hospitals is more than private hospitals? It\u2019s so because more cases are reported in government hospitals. Since the affected children are from poor families, they prefer to go to government hospitals. Delayed arrival of patients is one of the reasons for rise in mortality rate in government hospitals. The deaths have mostly been caused due to hyperglycemia (lack of glucose). Shouldn\u2019t you resign from the post on moral grounds?Why should I resign? I am doing what I am supposed to do as health minister. I am trying to execute the recommendations of medical experts. Medicines are being provided to the patients as per standard operating system (SOP) prepared by medical experts. It is because of the sensitivity of the government doctors that many children have returned home after proper treatment. Unfortunately, some children were not lucky. Why CM Nitish Kumar didn\u2019t visit the affected areas despite many deaths?The CM has taken the issue very seriously. He has been getting updates from me and the senior officials of the health department on a regular basis. When I was abroad to attend an official programme, the CM used to get updates from the officials of the health department. He is keeping a close tab on every development. The government is doing what it is expected to do. The CM spoke at length on the issue at an official function held in Patna recently. Is the viral disease linked to litchis?Medical experts have different views on the cause of the disease, which was first reported in the state in 1994-95. Researches have been carried out both by the medical experts of the country and abroad, but they have not mentioned any specific reason for the spread of the disease. One of the researches did talk about litchi. Hence, we have suggested the parents not to allow the children eat litchis from orchards empty stomach. Parents have also been advised to feed their children well before they go to bed at night. What steps are being taken to develop infrastructure at the government-run primary health centres in rural pockets of Bihar?The state government is committed to providing basic health facilities to the people and certain measures have been taken to increase the infrastructure at the grassroots level. Efforts are on to assess the situation at the PHCs and the availability of the doctors and the paramedical staff. The number of beds is also being increased in medical college and hospitals to accommodate more and more patients. Is there any plan to curb fake drug menace in the state?The government will act tough against those involved in fake drug deal. The health department officials have been told to get rid of the menace at the earliest. Raids and surprise inspections are carried out by the officials in this regard. How do you react to doctors\u2019 strike in West Bengal?In a democratic country like India everybody has the right to protest in peaceful manner. But nobody can be allowed to take law into their hands. What about safety and security of doctors in Bihar?Security around government hospitals in the state is reviewed from time to time. Temporary police outposts have been installed in some hospitals and private security guards deployed to deal with the rush of patients.

Pandey visited the hospital after he came to know that four suspected cases of AES have been reported at the NMCH.

Similarly, 14 suspected cases of AES have been reported at the paediatric department of Patna Medical College and Hospital till date. Three children with symptoms of AES were brought to the premier hospital from Vaishali and Sheohar districts on Saturday. The incharge of paediatric department, Dr Gopal Saran, said several medical tests on undergoing kids had been done, but the reports were still awaited. \u201cNo death due to suspected AES has so far been reported here. Two cases of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) have been detected and the kids were being provided proper treatment. They will be discharged from the hospital after getting well,\u201d he said.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination. His late grandfather, Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, was long associated with the Congress. | Full coverage of Lok Sabha elections in MaharashtraAmong other prominent leaders from Maharashtra in the first list of candidates are Union minister Nitin Gadkari from his hometown Nagpur, state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve from Jalna, Union MoS Hansraj Ahir from Chandrapur and Union MoS for defence Subash Bhamre from Dhule. Late BJP MP Gopinath Munde\u2019s daughter, Pritam, who was elected to Parliament with a record majority after her father\u2019s death, has been renominated from Beed. Sitting MP from Sangli Sanjay Patil has also been renominated, putting an end to speculation over any change in constituency. Patil\u2019s candidature was opposed by a section of BJP leaders in Sangli. However, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is understood to have called a meeting of local party leaders and resolved the differences.

Patna has been facing warm night-like condition since Friday. The hot and dry westerly winds made it unbearable for people to venture out of their homes on Saturday afternoon. Onset of monsoon after June 20: MetSuch weather conditions are prevailing at a time when moist and comparatively cooler easterly winds should have been blowing in the region with the onset of southwest monsoon. The onset of monsoon is delayed by more than a week. The rain-bearing winds normally enter Bihar through the northeastern districts around June 10-12 and cover the entire state by June 15. This time, the onset of monsoon in the country has been delayed from the very beginning as it hit the Kerala coast on June 8 against its normal date of June1. Later, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) declared on June 10 that the rain-bearing winds covered most parts of Mizoram and some parts of Manipur. The monsoon current over northeast India then remained almost constant over the next four days and finally made slight progress on Saturday. An all-India weather bulletin issued by IMD on Saturday stated that conditions were becoming favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon into some more parts of central Arabian Sea, Karnataka, remaining parts of Tamil Nadu, some more parts of central Bay, north and south Bay, some more parts of northeast India and some parts of north Bengal and Sikkim in one-two days. \u201cEven though prevailing level of excessive heat in most parts of Bihar is actually favourable for progress of monsoon as it creates a low-pressure area, which, in turn, attracts moisture towards itself. However, cyclone Vayu sucked majority of the moisture from the Arabian Sea, thus making the movement of monsoon current weak over northeast India, which progresses to Bihar in later stages,\u201d the Met official said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Samsung": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/heres-how-samsung-got-mocked-for-its-social-media-post/articleshow/69835890.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Kim Sharma": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/kim-sharma-thanks-varun-dhawan-for-the-motivation-as-the-latter-shares-a-video-of-her-from-the-gym/articleshow/69833931.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "12 people die due to heatstroke in Gaya Medical College": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//videos/city/patna/12-people-die-due-to-heatstroke-in-gaya-medical-college/videoshow/69809233.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Garbage next to no littering board": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/garbage-next-to-no-littering-board/articleshow/62201690.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Narendra Modi": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modis-outreach-to-opposition-your-every-word-counts/articleshow/69833753.cms", "time": "", "description": "NEW DELHI: Urging the opposition to stop worrying about numbers, PM Modi on Monday said every word of the opposition was important and all efforts should be made for a \" nishpaksh\" (non-partisan) approach to issues of public welfare and the larger interest of India. His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister said an active and effective opposition is a necessity in a democracy and pointed out that a well- argued and factual criticism of the government strengthens democracy. \"Sometimes such positive contributions are not noticed as they do not get high TRPs,\" he said. Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said. Referring to his recent speeches, the Prime Minister said that \"we started with ' sab ka saath, sab ka vikas', but the people have added an unprecedented 'vishwas' (trust) to the matter\". He said Monday marks the the start of the first session after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. \"I welcome all new MPs. With them comes new hope, new aspirations and new determination to serve,\" he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Help books and guides for civil services examinations can be found in plenty, said Ravindra, an MA economics student of PU. The nature of selling at these stalls is highly non-intrusive. Unlike other roadside stalls selling various consumer items, there is no shouting or chanting or thrusting wares at potential customers\u2019 faces. They sit patiently waiting for the customer to finish checking out the books \u2013 sometime walking from one end of the sidewalk to the other \u2013 and making up their minds. The deal is sealed in a couple of minutes. This quiet nature, however, does not stop slinky browsers who copy designs and notes from these books, with no intentions of buying them, from being shooed away vigorously. Bargaining is also the in-thing at these stalls as students would invariably pay less than the printed price of the books. Most of these sellers offer 20 to 30% discount on competitive books, said another PG history department student Satyarthi. Those who want to buy books at more cheaper rates visit the old book market of the city located near the Gandhi Maidan. One can easily get any book, from course books to novels of all ages, from this market. This is the best place to be as far as textbooks are concerned. Books for any subject, in any university in the country, can be found here at much cheaper rates. However, there is little guarantee of books being the original or a pirated version. \u201cWe get our stuff from Delhi and Calcutta. As far as the old books are concerned, they are collected over the years. Some have been bought too. People come to our stalls from Punjab, Delhi and even the south. We get foreign customers also,\u201d said book seller Chandrama Singh. It is, however, interesting to note that while the business of these roadside book stalls is growing day by day, the traditional book shops of the city are not finding enough customers these days. While some shops located on Ashok Rajpath have already been closed, others are switching over to other businesses.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath. The Pro tem speaker ruled that the members stick to the format provided. After this, the members of BJP started adding 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' after end of every oath.

The court of chief judicial magistrate of Muzaffarpur has fixed June 24 as the next date of hearing in the case. The complaint petition said both Dr Harsh Vardhan and Mangal Pandey failed to discharge their duties to contain the disease. Though the two ministers visited Muzaffarpur and took stock of the situation, the death of the children below the age of 10 years continued unabated. The petition alleged that no concrete step was taken by the health department to create awareness and sensitise people in the AES affected areas.

If convicted under Section 504 of IPC, the accused is liable for punishment for two years or fine or both.

Meanwhile, a senior paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said that only awareness programme would not help in preventing the deaths of children. \u201cI have been observing the cases of AES for last two and half decades. I have minutely studied the cases of the deaths. I have found that these children, either fallen prey of the disease or have been going treatment, are affected with lack of sugar in their body. This is called hypoglycaemia in medical term. The affected children are either suffering from another disease or are malnourished. These kids are from below poverty line and have been fed very poorly. So, they don't have stock of glucose in their body to release in emergency condition,\u201d he said. He added that AES affects the central nervous system, mostly in children and young adults. It starts with high fever, then hampers neurological functions causing mental disorientation, seizure, confusion, delirium, coma. However, a report by noted paediatrician of CMC Vellor Dr T Jacob John, published in Current Science mentioned that the clinical features in patients were stereo-type. \u201cSudden onset without prodromal phase, inconsistent presence of fever, brain edema, absence of inflammatory cell response in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and hypoglycemia. These clinical features and preliminary epidemiological findings of tightly restricted seasonality and geographic distribution as well as sparing of children below 2 years support the diagnosis of acute non-infectious encephalopathy as against viral encephalitis. Children are quite well until evening, but early next morning they are found seriously ill with brain function derangement and seizures.

However, emergency services were exempted from the purview of the strike. The strike was called to protest frequent attacks on doctors across the country. Reena Devi (35), a resident of Kankerbagh in the city, was seething with anger as she had to run from pillar to post for the treatment of her 13-year-old daughter Rita, who was suffering from high fever. The main entrance gate of the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), where she was waiting with her daughter, was closed due to the doctors\u2019 strike. \u201cYahan garibon ka koi sudh lene wala nahi hai (nobody is here to take care of the poor),\u201d a visibly angry Reena said. Like Reena, many from the lower strata of society had to suffer a lot due to the doctors\u2019 agitation in solidarity with their West Bengal counterparts on Monday. One Rohan Kumar (25), who was hit by sunstroke, too had to return from the NMCH due to the agitation. Superintendent of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) Dr Rajiv Ranjan said the emergency wing of the hospital functioned as usual. The scene at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (AIGMS) was more heart rendering where Janki Devi (35), a resident of Chhapra in Saran district, was wreathing in pain. \u201cI am suffering from arthritis. It\u2019s very painful. I had an appointment with the doctor but he is not present in the hospital. The officials told me that the doctors are on strike and it will continue for a few more days,\u201d she told this newspaper. Similarly, 65-year-old Nand Kishore Mandal, a resident of Madhepura, had to return to his native village as the officials at the premier hospital told him that the functioning had been hampered due to the doctors\u2019 agitation. \u201cCome next time as the doctors are on indefinite strike,\u201d Mandal was told by one of employees of the IGIMS. He too had problem in one of his legs. Dr Anurag Kumar, casualty medical officer at emergency ward of IGIMS said, \u201cWe have supported the nationwide strike called by the IMA against frequent attacks on doctors across the country. However, the emergency services were not hampered due to the strike.\u201d Anjit Kumar, a resident of Imamganj in Gaya district, whose cousin was admitted to the IGIMS, corroborated Dr Anurag\u2019s claim. \u201cEmergency services at the hospital were satisfactory. Immediate attention was given to the critical patients,\u201d he said. Around 12,000 doctors joined the strike on the call of the Indian Medical Association across the state on Monday.

The body of the deceased, which was buried under heaps of sand in a house which was under construction, was recovered by the police on Sunday. Police sources said that Niyaz, a resident of Mumtaj mohalla in Naugachia and Phulo, a resident of Naugachia Bazaar locality, had purchased a lottery ticket by pooling money nearly three months ago. They won a prize money of Rs 1 lakh. Niyaz collected the prize money from the lottery company as the ticket was in his possession. But instead of sharing the prize money in equal amount with Phulo (the accused), he paid only Rs 30,000 to the latter and was trying to avoid him for the last two months.

The deaths were reported from three districts in the Magadh division \u2014Aurangabad, Gaya and Nawada \u2014 over the past 24 hours. Altogether 44 deaths were recorded till 12am on Saturday. Aurangabad reported the highest number of deaths at 30 followed by 20 in Gaya and 11 in Nawada. The figures were confirmed by state disaster management department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit. \u201cPostmortem reports in most cases have confirmed heat wave as the cause of death. We are keeping a close watch on the situation. We have also issued an advisory to all distract magistrates to take preventive steps as well as relief measures in the light of prevailing heat wave conditions,\u201d Pratyaya told TOI on Sunday. In Aurangabad, the death toll went up to 30 with four more deaths reported on Sunday. Aurangabad deputy development commissioner Ghanshyam Meena, who is also officiating as DM, confirmed the 30 deaths on Sunday and admitted that five seriously ill patients were referred to the Narayani Medical College in neighbouring Rohtas district. In another indication that death count may rise, Aurangabad civil surgeon Surendra Prasad said relatives of some of the deceased refused to allow doctors to conduct autopsy. \u201cSome of the patients couldn\u2019t be registered due to the chaos in the hospital premises. They left with the bodies of their relatives without post-mortem examination,\u201d he told reporters in Aurangabad. However, unconfirmed reports put the death toll at 33 in Aurangabad district alone even as a newly built ICU and a well-equipped room being used as de-addiction centre were thrown open to accommodate new patients at the Aurangabad sadar hospital. Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said on Sunday that most of the heatstroke victims were either brought dead or succumbed during treatment at the Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital (ANMMCH), Gaya. Currently 14 people are under treatment at the hospital, Singh added. Majority of the deceased were those above 60, who couldn\u2019t bear the heatwave that swept through southwest Bihar on Saturday, Singh told this newspaper over phone on Sunday. Four doctors from Patna have been sent to ANMMCH to assist with the rush of patients, while primary health centres have been told to keep aside 50% of their beds for sunstroke victims. Senior district officials have been told to camp at the hospital till the situation returned to normal. In Nawada district, three died at the sadar hospital soon after being admitted on Saturday evening, while the rest died during treatment. Nawada DM Kaushal Kishore said 14 people are undergoing treatment at the government hospital at Pawapuri. Health experts said heatstroke occurs when the part of the brain, which regulates body temperature, starts malfunctioning due to excessive heat. The daily heatwave bulletin issued by India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday evening stated that maximum temperatures were markedly above normal (5.1 degrees C or more) at many places over Bihar. The state also witnessed severe heatwave conditions on Sunday. Nawada civil surgeon Srinath Prasad told TOI that most patients were elderly people. \u201cMost of the deceased were in the age group of 70-85 years and belonged to poor as well as middle-income families. They arrived with complaints of sudden high fever, body ache and unconsciousness,\u201d he said. Authorities conceded their failures in spreading awareness in the state. \u201cWe concede that the unprecedented heatwave conditions this year...reveals the inadequacy of our awareness campaigns and limitations of our reach to the grassroots. We urge all stakeholders, including district administrations to disseminate awareness messages in every village and ward and take actions as specified under Heat Action Plan of the state government,\u201d Bihar State Disaster Management Authority vice-chairman Vyasji said. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of grave concern for all of disaster management practitioners, BSDMA and district administration that so many precious lives have been lost due to heatwave conditions in Aurangabad, Gaya and Nawada. This is more painful that the deaths have occurred in so many numbers despite our Heat Action Plan shared with all departments and districts recently as well as capacity building of the panchayat representatives over the last one year.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-heatwave-death-toll-surges-to-61/articleshow/69816916.cms", "time": "2019-06-17 07:25:00"}, "Shibani Dandekar's most sizzling pictures": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/shibani-dandekar-sizzling-pics/shibani-dandekars-most-sizzling-pictures/photostory/65770159.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Bihar: Schools to remain closed till June 22": {"description": "PATNA: The government issued an order on Monday to all district magistrates (DM) and education officers, asking them to shut government and private schools as well as coaching institutes across the state till June 22 due to the prevailing heatwave. While state project director of Bihar Education Project Council Sanjay Singh issued a notification regarding closure of government and government-aided schools across the state till June 22, state chief secretary Deepak Kumar ordered closure of even private schools and coaching institutes till Saturday. Later in the evening, Patna DM Kumar Ravi asked all government and private schools in the district to extend their summer vacations till June 22. Summer holidays in all schools had been extended for seven days till June 19, almost a week ago due to scorching heat. Now, teachers expect a hectic schedule after schools reopen. They are, therefore, making strategies to cover the syllabi on time before the arrival of exams. St Michael\u2019s High School principal Father Edison J Armstrong told this newspaper, \u201cAfter the school reopens, we will focus more on academics than extracurricular activities. Our teachers will make sure that syllabi of classes X and XII are completed on time.\u201d Notre Dame Academy teacher Kalpana Sinha, who teaches Class XII students, agreed that an extended summer vacation would affect academics. She said, \u201cWe are likely to convert Saturdays into full working days for completing the syllabi on time.\u201d Although summer vacations are fun, a third extension has started worrying students as well.
