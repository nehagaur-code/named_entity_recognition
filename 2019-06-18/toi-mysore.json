As residents have been making frantic calls to snake charmers, and others, adept in taming and rescuing snakes, the Mysuru Zoo, taking cognisance of the gravity of the problem and the lack of adequate training in those called on to attend to snakes, has decided to conduct a two-day workshop to share knowledge on scientific methods of rescuing snakes with the traditional experts. Authorities at the Mysuru Zoo are likely to start the process to identify traditional snake charmers working across the city, and get them to participate in the workshop. The zoo management is equally keen on registering all the snake charmers, who will be issued certificates, which will provide them a degree of authenticity. Besides, these certificates will further help civic agencies and local administration streamline the entire process of rescuing stray snakes, with the certificates helping the authorities maintain a log of charmers, whom both residents and agencies can readily contact. Rise in the number of snakes reported at homes, and roads Mysuru has correspondingly triggered a spike in the number of people identifying themselves as rescuers. However, in the absence of any mechanism to assess their ability, coupled with the lack of government certification has forced residents to take the abilities of the snake rescuers at their word. Presently, zoo authorities estimate that there are as many as 10 rescuers operating in the city. Among the techniques that the rescuers will be taught in the course of the workshop include identification of venomous and non-venomous snakes, safety procedures to be followed during the rescue operation, ethical methods of saving the snake, and moving the reptiles to safer homes. Mysuru Zoo executive director Ajit Kulkarni told STOI that their desire to promote a more scientific approach to rescue of animals was the motivation behind conducting the workshop. \u201cThere is an imminent need to streamline the entire process of rescuing, and treating snakes in the city. We are yet to decide on the dates for the workshop,\u201d Kulkarni said. \u2018Snake\u2019 Shyyam, a veteran in the field of rescuing snakes, lauded the Mysuru Zoo\u2019s initiative, stating that it would equip amateurs with the right techniques, besides increasing their knowledge about the reptiles. \u201cMany rescuers, while starting out, are unaware about which of the snakes are venomous, and which ones are not. They fray into the profession, prompted by enthusiasm and curiosity. One must become a rescuer, not a catcher. This workshop that the zoo wants to conduct will also learn about instruments that can be used. Most rescuers today use instruments which harm the snakes,\u201d he told STOI. Shyyam called on the zoo authorities to ensure that rescuers, attacked by snakes during rescue operations, received the necessary medical attention.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Rajasthan Royals 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rajasthan-royals-team-2019-players-list-rr-team-2019/articleshow/67151472.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Patients flood govt hospitals in South Karnataka as pvt hospitals shut OPDs": {"description": "MYSURU: The nationwide strike by doctors remained peaceful in south Karnataka, though it adversely affected the functioning of private hospitals as their OPDs remained shut throughout the day. However, emergency services were available to patients. In the city, 1,200 to 1,300 patients visit K R Hospital every day. However, on Monday, due to the absence of OPD in private hospitals, the number went up to 1,400. Those who came to K R, Cheluvamba and other government hospitals didn\u2019t face much difficulty, but patients visiting private hospital OPDs had a hard time. Though the management of most private hospitals had announced in advance that the OPD would not be functional on Monday, many still thronged their OPDs. The private hospitals had decided to close their OPDs from 6am on Monday to 6am on Tuesday in solidarity with the doctors in West Bengal, who were attacked by the relatives of a patient. Dr Nanjundaswamy, superintendent (incharge), KR Hospital, said: \u201cWe had held multiple meetings nearly a week ago. Though our junior doctors were staging protests, we had roped in additional staff and were ready to handle any number of patients. Usually, on an average, 1,200 to 1,300 patients visit KR Hospital while on Monday, due to the shutdown of OPD at private hospitals, the number crossed 1,400.\u201d Dr M S Jayanth, secretary, Indian Medical Association, Mysuru said: \u201cTo show solidarity with the doctors of West Bengal, all private hospitals in Mysuru had closed their OPD.

In the town, doctors took out a protest march, seeking a Central act to protect doctors on duty. As private hospitals didn't open their OPDs, there was a huge rush of patients at Chamarajanagar Institute of Medical Sciences. The hospital authorities said they had made elaborate arrangements to manage the extra rush. In Kodagu also the situation was not different. There was a huge rush at Kodagu Institute of Medical Sciences as the OPDs were not available in private hospitals and the clinics. According to health department sources, the situation was near normal. In Hassan, doctors took out a protest march and medical students demanded stern action against those who attacked the doctors in West Bengal. They urged the Central and state governments to ensure the safety of the doctors working in government hospitals. In Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga too the doctors held a protest march.

However, in the aftermath of watching the performance in Rangayana, Karnad was most expansive in his praise of the artistes and the crew, whom he credited with having thoughtfully elevated the protagonist of the play. Karnad had a special bond with Rangayana, the theatre repertory in Mysuru, as he did with its founder, BV Karanth \u2013 the doyen of Indian drama. In the 1980s, when Rangayana was still trying to establish itself as a prominent theatre space in the state, Karnad could be spotted here often, and his demise has seen a palpable pall of gloom descend on the repertory. As recently as in December 2018, Karnad with an oxygen container in tow, arrived at Rangayana to inaugurate the winter theatre fest Bahuroopi. The sight of an ailing Karnad, breathing with the help of an electronic apparatus, throwing open the drama fete, was as much an enduring testimony to his love for the stage, as it was for his tryst with Rangayana. In his inaugural address, Karnad reminisced about the many evenings he spent with Karanth at Vanaranga in Rangayana, whiskey keeping the two doyens of theatre company. Karanth had, years before establishing Rangayana in Mysuru, directed one of Karnad\u2019s most celebrated plays \u2018Hayavadana\u2019, and the performance of \u2018Taledanda\u2019 several years later was a fitting coda to the playwright\u2019s waltz with the repertory. Rangayana artiste Hulugappa Kattimani recalled, with a mixture of grief and nostalgic pride, Karnad\u2019s appreciation for his depiction of the King Bijjala in \u2018Taledanda\u2019. \u201cIt was this role which set the foundation for my career as a theatre actor. I will remain indebted to Karnad for this,\u201d Kattimani told TOI. The artiste recalled, with visible delight, Karnad\u2019s presence at rehearsals of \u2018Taledanda\u2019 that Kattimani was staging with the inmates of Mysuru Central Prison in 2005. \u201cHe was impressed with the performances of the prisoners,\u201d he added. The humane doyenFormer Rangayana director Bhagirathi Bai Kadam began her innings in theatre speaking the lines of Girish Karnad on stage. \u201cAlong with Karanth, he was the tallest personality in Kannada theatre. I have been very fond of him ever since I forayed into theatre. When I was at the National School of Drama, New Delhi, Karnad would come to see our rehearsals, and remark on our performances, asking us to make corrections where necessary. He was extremely straightforward,\u201d Bhagirathi said. Sharing an anecdote revealing of the humaneness that remained one of Karnad\u2019s calling cards till the very end, Bhagirathi said, \u201cWe shared screen space when he adapted Kuvempu\u2019s novel Kanooru Heggathi for television. He played Chandregowda, and I was Subbamma. However, when we had to dub for our roles, I was pregnant with my first child and I was in Assam. In the climax of the serial, my character has to undergo an abortion. But Karnad, taking note of my condition, asked me not to dub for those scenes since they could disturb me.\u201d Karnataka Sahitya Akadami chairman Prof Aravind Malagatti hailed Karnad as a lodestar of Kannada literature. \u201cKarnad, UR Ananthamurthy are no more, but they have left behind legacies rich with their ideologies, which people must imbibe in their daily life,\u201d he said. The tireless activistFormer Ranagayana director H Janardhana, popularly called Jenni, chose to highlight Girish Karnad\u2019s contributions to the welfare of society. He was a fearless activist committed to secularism. \u201cHe was staunchly anti-communal,\u201d said Jenni, also highlighting the rich contribution of the playwright to the theatre repertory he once headed. \u201cKarnad is responsible for transforming modern Kannada theatre,\u201d he added. Bahuroopi in playwright\u2019s honourTo honour Girish Karnad\u2019s multifold contributions to literature, Rangayana is planning to host the 2020 edition of its annual winter theatre fest Bahuroopi in his honour. \u201cWe will organise a condolence meet on Thursday, where Karnad\u2019s close acquaintances such as Kappanna and H Janardhan, who will speak about him,\u201d said joint director of Rangyana VN Mallikarjunaswamy. - (With inputs from Madiha Khanum) Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "India vs Pakistan": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/india-vs-pakistan-rohit-kuldeep-ensure-india-maintain-clean-slate-against-pakistan-in-world-cup/articleshow/69817365.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Sewerage water keeps overflowing from two manholes": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/seweragewaterkeepsoverflowingfromtwomanholes/articleshow/67665004.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Gram panchayat asks public to click photographs of those dumping construction debris": {"description": "MYSURU: Appealing to the public to help tackle the mounting problem of construction debris dumped by miscreants near the Bandipalya Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) at the foot of Chamundi Hills, members of the Hosahundi gram panchayat (GP) have asked residents to take photographs of those unloading waste, and send it to them. The GP members have assured the residents that action will be initiated against those caught causing damage to the environment. However, the problem is not limited to Bandipalya alone. Across the city, construction waste is being indiscriminately unloaded at vacant sites and medians of wide roads \u2013 the problem is particularly pronounced on a particularly isolated stretch of the Outer Ring Road (ORR).

However, with the plant yet to become a reality, mounds of material used and subsequently discarded for construction of buildings such as bricks, stones and concrete continue to find their way to the sides of the road and vacant plots.

YK Dinesh, a PU student at Vijayalakshmi Junior College, Balele, and PB Pemmi, an estate labourer, rushed to help her but were injured when Jagadish fired indiscriminately.  Asha was a much-loved teacher in Lions High School and villagers and students rushed to pay their last respects. Asha, whose husband died several years ago, had two daughters, one employed and the other a final-year degree student. Jagadish, a coffee grower, lost his wife two years ago and is survived by a daughter. Initially, Jagadish and Asha reportedly shared a friendly relationship but there was some discord over financial matters in recent times. Jagadi sh was said to be blackmailing Asha with a few fake pictures of her. She had complained to Gonikoppal police, who had sent him to prison for a few days. After being released, he threatened to kill her and she complained to the SP. An enraged Jagadish reportedly visited her at home and threatened her. A terrified Asha even installed CCTV cameras around her house. Police said Jagadish was known to tease girls waiting for a bus and would offer to drop them.

Poor maintenance had resulted in the two reservoirs turning into a cavernous cesspool, with dead birds and stray waste items being found in their depths. To make matters worse, wild algae mushroomed inside these tanks, leaving officials exhausted with the sheer effort of having to keep the two basins, which stored water for nearly 35% of the city\u2019s population, clean. Taking note of the seriousness of the problem, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) ordered the renovation of the two tanks, and with the project having been completed, the refurbished reservoirs are set to be inaugurated on June 30. Water pumped in Hongalli is filtered, and stored in the two reservoirs. With the two central tanks now cleaned and renovated , residents in the 20 wards will no longer have to bother about the supply of water during odd hours of the day. Renovated with funds to the tune of Rs 27.2 crore allocated under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) scheme, the primary objective behind the project was to prevent contamination of water stored in the two reservoirs. Under the project, the two tanks have been strengthened with roof slabs, separate columns, a concrete flooring raft and adequate drainage facilities. In order to prevent mosquitoes from using the tanks as a breeding pool, ventilators covered by a stainless steel mesh have been installed. What is more, galvanised sheets have been erected around the two tanks. Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, accompanied by Chamaraja MLA L Nagendra and Vijayanagar corporator Subbaiah on Wednesday inspected ongoing work at the two reservoirs, and discussed the progress of the project with Karnataka Urban Water Supply Drainage Board executive engineer (EE) Prasanna Murthy and Vani Vilas Water Works EE Harish. Murthy assured the three elected representatives of the work being completed in 15 days. \u201cThe two tanks will be ready for inauguration on June 30,\u201d Murthy said. Murthy added that, once the renovated tanks were inaugurated, water would be supplied during peak hours, which would help residents store it in adequate amounts. \u201cWe will be able to supply drinking water daily, and we are hoping that the quantity will see a spike,\u201d he said. Among others, water from the two reservoirs is supplied to Krihnaraja Mohalla, Chamaraja Mohalla, Hebbal, Metagalli, Hinkal and Vijayanagar. Residents are likely to feel relieved about the impending inauguration of the renovated tanks. \u2018Senior corporators ruling the roost in MCC Council\u2019The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) Council had become a mafia, fumed Mysuru MP Pratap Simha. \u201cThe council is meeting only for formality\u2019s sake. Senior corporators are walking away with a lion\u2019s share of the grants, and obtain approval for all of their projects. I will write to the deputy commissioner, asking him to stay the approval for those projects approved at the recent MCC Council meeting,\u201d said Simha. Asking for accounts on the Rs 68 crore allocated to the civic agency by the central government, Simha said, \u201cThese funds must be used judiciously, and primarily to ensure supply of drinking water. But, that is not the case. Senior corporators are running the show at the MCC Council. There is no equitable distribution of funds among all the corporators. These senior corporators have become an oligarchy of sorts.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath. The Pro tem speaker ruled that the members stick to the format provided. After this, the members of BJP started adding 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' after end of every oath. Some of the prominent names who took oath from Madhya Pradesh included K P Yadav who defeated Jyotiraditya Scindia, Rakesh Singh, Ramakant Bhargava and Nakul Nath.

Patil, who participated in the 52nd passing-out parade for women jail warders at the Prison Training Institute in the city, said, \u201cThe many demands put forward by the staff in prison and fire departments are being deliberated upon by the government. Discussions about implementing the sixth pay commission are under way.\u201d Patil pointed out that the government had, among other initiatives, made provisions for video conferencing, prison call system, installation of 700 LED television sets, et al. \u201cWe will allocate around Rs 200 crore for E-Prison. The longstanding demand for setting up of the Karnataka Prison Development Board too will be fulfilled, which will ensure the welfare of personnel working in the prisons,\u201d said the home minister. Patil said that the presence of engineers, and postgraduates among the 170 jail warders who passed out on Monday was a bittersweet reality. \u201cWhile I am pleased that such highly qualified individuals are joining the prison department, I cannot but help feel disappointed that they are not getting jobs befitting their academic credentials. People must get jobs that are commensurate with their qualifications,\u201d he added. A beaming HS Revanna, inspector general of police (prisons), said that Karnataka was the only state in the country that had successfully filled all the vacancies in the department. \u201cWe are full staffed at the moment,\u201d said Revanna, who was pleased with prison department personnel being deputed on election duty \u2013 a first in the state.

Both my parents are daily wage labourers. After getting my engineering degree, I attended interviews at more than 10 companies, but all they offered me was a monthly salary of Rs 8,000.

However, unlike in West Bengal, where a number of doctors refused to attend to work, healthcare professionals in the district decided not to shirk work so as to avoid inconveniencing patients. IMA, Mysuru president Dr SB Prakash said that the whole of the medical fraternity was outraged on learning about the attack on Dr Pariba Mukherjee at the NRS Medical College in Kolkata. Pointing to the resonance that their protest had found across the globe, Dr Prakash said, \u201cThe World Medical Association has condemned the attack, and passed a resolution against violence at hospitals and all healthcare centres. The incident reported in Kolkata is barbaric. Dr Pariba Mukherjee\u2019s condition is critical.

Stating that doctors across the country would not cooperate with West Bengal, he added, \u201cShould the West Bengal government request the services of doctors from other states to tide over this crisis, we will not accede to such a plea. Doctors in West Bengal are starting to feel insecure, and the central government must pass a law to safeguard doctors, who are being attacked for no mistake of theirs. We also condemn the statements made by West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee.\u201d He added that hundreds of patients from West Bengal travelled to Bengaluru for treatment. Other members of IMA, Mysuru pointed out that doctors in the eastern state were being targetted for no valid reason, which they said was the reason behind many of them refusing to perform surgeries and diagnose critical cases. \u201cThis is one of the reasons why several patients come to Bengaluru from the state,\u201d an IMA, Mysuru doctor said.

Papaya is a biennial crop, and affliction by PRSV is a commonly reported problem in South Karnataka. Thimakapura averred that the formulation he has come up with is non-toxic, and can help control the spread of virus in other crops such as beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, orchids among others. President of the University of Mysore Old Students\u2019 Association, and director of the technical wing of Green Lifescience Technologies, Thimakapura was determined to come up with a remedy for PRSV, a pestilent menace that is found across the world. For Thimakapura, the greatest reward for his work has been the results that farmers have reported after using his formulation for the past two years. \u201cIt has already been tested by farmers across India. This is besides many of the in-house trials that we have conducted,\u201d said the scientist. What sets the formulation \u2013 Thimakapura has named it \u2018PowerPlus\u2019 \u2013 apart is that it helps prevent the onslaught by the virus, and can help cure those plants blighted by it. Unaffected papaya plants in his plot growing beside those affected by PSRV, Thimakapura said, attested to the efficacy of his formulation. \u201cThe virus has the potential to trigger an epidemic. As of now, there is no variety of papaya that is resistant to the virus, nor is there a foolproof mechanism that can help protect them from its threat. So, I hope that my product will serve as a boon for farmers,\u201d he said. Consequences of virus infectionStunted growth, and lack of fruit-breaking ability are two of the most disastrous consequences of affliction by the Papaya Ring Spot Virus (PSRV) in papaya plants. Fruits borne by plants infected by the virus often exhibit clear signs of the disease: These include a discernible change in its taste, bumps and characteristic ring-shaped spots on the skin. PSRV spreads through an insect vector at an exponential rate, and all it takes for an entire plot to grow infested is a small clutch of PSRV-blighted plants. \u201cFarmers dread it because it is impossible to contain its spread,\u201d Vasanth Kumar Thimakapura said.

Citizens have repeatedly urged the authorities concerned to act against both, the telecom companies and property owners, the latter for allowing the installation of the towers, but to no avail. However, Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) commissioner Shilpa Nag has ordered a survey of towers across the city. The order issued by the civic agency has ignited hope among residents of the towers vanishing from their neighbourhood for good. \u201cOnce we have all the necessary information about telecom towers, we will be able to decide on the course of action to be taken,\u201d Shilpa said.

In the Pulwama attack, the terrorists after setting off the IED, opened fire at the Army vehicle. \"Initial reports reveal the vehicle suffered extensive damage,\" the official said. Three of the soldiers injured in the blast were said to be serious, sources said. Soon after the attack, Army, police and SOG reinforcements were rushed to the spot and a massive search operation was launched. A defence spokesman, however, said some of the men sustained minor injuries in the IED blast. Damage was minimal due to the alertness of the patrol party, he said. The vehicle was an armoured ALS and not a Casspir (a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle), he added.

The girl was forcefully taken away by a moneylender on January 7 as the girl\u2019s mother failed to repay a loan. Five people, including the moneylender Padhma, have been booked under various sections of IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso). A police constable, who is friend of Padhma, too, was allegedly involved in the crime. But he has not been named in the FIR. An IPC section (whoever being a police officer commits rape), however, has been included in the FIR and a probe is under way. Police commissioner K T Balakrishna told TOI that two people have been arrested and search is on for other accused. \u201cThe incident has left the family in a state of shock with the survivor\u2019s father attempting suicide after learning about the experience his daughter had to undergo at the hands of the moneylender and her friends. The family is feeling threatened,\u201d a child activist claimed. On the other side, the incident has also exposed the practice of lending money at high rates of interest that is going on unabated. Sources claimed that the girl\u2019s mother had taken Rs 3 lakh from Padhma, her friend, to fend for her treatment on weekly interest. As the family failed to pay the money back, Padhma forcefully took away her daughter, a class IX student. The girl was rescued with the help of Odanadi Seva Samsthe on June 6 and an FIR was filed on June 10. The other accused in the case are Prasanna, Vinodh, a lecturer, Ravi and Vicky. Procedures not followed: ForumOdanadi Seva Samsthe director L Parashuram told TOI that the girl\u2019s mother had approached them and subsequently they met senior police officers seeking help. \u201cWe were kept away from the rescue operation by Kuvempunagar police who rescued the girl and sent her with parents. A day later the girl\u2019s family again approached us following which we took them to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), a quasi-judicial body, which took cognizance of the case and handed over the girl\u2019s custody to us,\u201d he said. The same day police took the survivor from Odanadi for a medical test and then to the judge for recording statements. After the procedures were completed, police didn\u2019t bring back the girl to Odanadi. Officials claimed that the girl expressed her wish of going with her parents before the judge and she was again sent with her mother. Parashuram said the jurisdictional police did not follow procedures and threw the laws governing children and rape survivors to wind. \u201cWe have explained the development to CWC and are awaiting their directive,\u201d he added. CWC chairperson Kamala H T said, \u201cWe have sent the girl to Odanadi, but the childcare and protection institution has written to us about the developments.

The students hail from poor families and this is their first exposure to the language. None of them attended nursery or pre-nursery where kids gain a very basic understanding of English. But the 18 students are quick learners and have been able to follow simple sentences after a week of classes. They answer questions and identify numbers, common objects and colours. Hemalatha recently underwent a 15-day training for the classes. Until now, she had been teaching English to students in higher grades. She is impressed by her new students and believes they will learn even faster in the coming weeks. \u201cThey found things difficult in the first few days, but they picked up quickly later.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

With no option to return home, Pratap chose to spend the night in the seemingly secure corridors of Shaneshwara temple. The priest walked in by 6am the next day and questioned Pratap. That\u2019s when the priest found out he was a Dalit. He summoned villagers who allegedly took law into their hands. Police said the four accused thrashed and paraded Pratap naked on Veeranapura Road for entering the temple. They recorded the act and uploaded it on social media. Basavaraju, Manikya, Satisha and Channakeshava Murthy, all residents of Madrahalli village, were arrested on Wednesday.

Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

Under the care of Mysuru Zoo, it has been shifted to the Koorgahalli facility on the outskirts of the city. The eight-year-old big cat is healthy and there are no external injuries barring a few canines damaged in efforts to escape the cage. Villagers in and around HD Kote had complained to the forest department that the tiger was prowling in the border areas for 45 days and lifting livestock at will. It had killed around 20 cattle as it was looking for easy prey, an official said. The last of the kills was on Saturday. The foresters summoned Dasara elephants to nab the tiger and launched combing operations. The tiger was spotted a few times but it managed to give the elephants the slip. As it started to venture out of the woods repeatedly, the foresters sought the permission of the PCCF (Wildlife), the chief wildlife warden, to capture it. Once the permission was given, a cage was placed at Kalasur, just outside the N Begur Range, with a slab of meat in it. At 12.30am, the tiger walked in and was caged. Early in the day, it was shifted to Mysuru and by 10am, to Koorgahalli. Vet Dr DN Nagaraj told TOI that the big cat had no external injuries. It sustained some minor injuries when it tried to escape after being caged. Mysuru district wildlife warden Krithika Alanahalli said zoo authorities were now looking after the tigress. 62 sheep killed by predator in Chikkaballapura districtBengaluru: It was a gory Sunday morning at Nallala Halli in Chikkaballapura district after villagers found carcasses of 62 sheep in a pool of blood in a shed owned by family and relatives of Venkataramanappa. While villagers suspect a leopard had attacked the sheep, foresters are awaiting the post mortem report. Chikkaballapura range forest officer Vikram RN said the incident took place on Saturday night. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether the sheep were attacked by a leopard or a pack of dogs. Leopards usually kill a sheep or a two, but there have been instances of mass killing too. The nearest forest is at least 7km away. We found a gap in the stone-slab shed and the predator may have sneaked in through it. Sheep being killed in such large numbers in this manner is unheard of here,\u201d he added. Another forest official from Chikkaballapura said villagers who are friends or members of a large family put sheep in one shed to save money. \u201cThe owners are shattered. We\u2019ve already initiated the process to give compensation,\u201d he added. In March 2018, a leopard killed 15 sheep in Kyalanur village, Kolar district.

For women, it has become a hard choice to use veggies which are less priced, when compared to beans and carrots. Tomatoes, which usually cost Rs 10 per kilogram, has gone up to Rs 40 per/kg. Similarly, fresh beans now cost Rs 140 per/kg outside market premises. Prathima, a resident of Hebbal, and working in a private organisation, said choosing vegetables which are less pricy is a difficult task. Middle class families cannot afford to cook beans, capsicum and carrots at home. Even tomatoes are priced at Rs 50 per kilogram in local shops. \u201cIt easily costs Rs 500 to buy vegetables enough for a week. Price hike is burning our pockets,\u201d Prathima told TOI. Besides deficit rain, occasions like weddings have also raised the demand for vegetables. While the demand is high, fewer supply of vegetables has led to price hike. The prices of turnip, drumsticks and bottle gourd have also gone up. Gayathri, a homemaker of Nivedita Nagar, told TOI that vegetables like beans, capsicum and carrots will not be used in kitchen until the prices come down. \u201cEvery summer, the prices would be high, but never did I see the price of beans touching Rs 140. Cabbage, which was available for Rs 7, now costs Rs 30. In Devaraja market, the prices are comparatively low, but quality vegetables will cost us more,\u201d she said. G Shankar, former president of vegetable vendors association of Devaraja market said that the RMC has fixed prices for the vegetables\u2014beans costs Rs 60, brinjal Rs 13, ladies finger Rs 12, tomato Rs 32. \u201cHowever, the quality vegetables supplied from Bengaluru and other regions come high-priced. Transportation and labour charges will be levied on the vegetables, thus increasing the prices. In the recent days, not many farmers are dependent on rain as they use borewells to grow crops. During summer, groundwater level drops, putting more difficulty on the farmers,\u201d Shankar opined. AB Sanjay, deputy director, department of horticulture told TOI that the vegetables in city markets come from areas of Varuna, KR Nagar, T Narasipura and parts of KR Pet. From quality capsicum to APMC Mysuru come from Hassan. Vegetables are grown in rain-fed areas. Veggies like cabbage, cauliflower are winter-harvested whereas capsicum and beans are summer vegetables. During summer, farmers who have access to borewells grow vegetables like beans and capsicum, he said. Given that this is the marriage season, there is high demand for vegetables. Even though the price of beans is Rs 140 per kilogram, farmers hardly get Rs 25 for their harvest. Since the demand is high, middlemen are encashing on the scarcity. By the end of September, prices are likely to fall, Sanjay opined. Sanjay also said that the district has received 30% less rain.

The have also launched a coffee powder brand \u2014 \u2018Adavi\u2019, and thereby living a self-sustainable and quality life. There are around ten hamlets in BRT Tiger Reserve with around 1,500 Soliga families. The tribals used to depend on forest produce, including honey, root vegetables and amla. But 20 years ago, these tribals were introduced to paddy, ragi and millet. But they could not succeed due to the menace of wild boars and other wild animals which regularly raided their lands. The livelihood of the tribe, however, improved after Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) encouraged the tribals to take up coffee and pepper cultivation. ATREE head C Madhegowda, who is also a Soliga tribal, told TOI that ATREE encouraged them to prepare products using forest produce. \u201cWe produced a hakku patra under Forest Rights Act to use non-timber forest products and sell the products legally. All the Soliga tribals of the 10 hamlets formed an association called Sri Biligirirangaswamy Soligara Samskarana Sangha, which was registered. An initiative was made to collect the forest produce, process it, and market the product,\u201d he said. But it was after the tribals started growing coffee that they managed to earn a decent income by selling the coffee beans to the company. ATREE used to purchase the coffee from tribals on market price and supply it to a private company. Nearly 600 Soliga families are involved in cultivating coffee in BR Hills. Madhegowda, who is also the president of Coffee Growers Association, said just a year ago the Social Welfare Department had given the Coffee Board and Karnataka Maharishi Valmiki Scheduled Tribe Development Corporation a four-year project to promote coffee for the welfare of the Soliga tribe. \u201cAt present, 90% of the coffee produced by Soligas is supplied to MG Plantation in Chikkamagaluru as per the understanding with the Board. The coffee powder prepared by the company is sold under the brand name Adavi,\u201d he said. The product is sold in local shops too. There are three shops in BRT which are managed by Soligas who get 15% discount for the product. The Mysuru Zoo authorities have provided a stall on the zoo premises and ATREE runs two stalls in Bengaluru also. All the stalls are managed by members of the Soliga tribe. This year, the total coffee cultivation by the Soliga tribals stood at 35 tonne against last year\u2019s 28 tonne. Around 50% of the Soligas in BRT cultivate coffee. The Board has promised to provide training to produce quality coffee and to get certificate for organic products. \u201cWe cultivate only organic coffee as we do not use pesticides,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the sangha has procured fair trade certificate so that they can sell the product in international market, the Coffee Board is contemplating on turning the association into a company so that they get more profit and benefits from the government schemes. Madhegowda said the profits will be given back to the Soliga community. The earnings by selling the coffee are being used for their education, health and development, he said. A tribal Jadegowda from Kalyani hamlet told TOI that he has around 500 coffee plants in a half acre land and he earns around Rs 10,000 annually by selling coffee beans.

The DC has directed officials to examine all cases and book cases against the owners of kalyana mantap and priests. Since the department has received complaints about child marriages being reported at Guddekal temple in the city, the DC said that a CCTV must be installed in the temple and the priests must be warned.

The statue of Nandi, the celestial bull rests midway along the road to the Sri Chamundeshwari temple. One often spots devotees visiting the shrine of the Goddess, stop along the way to seek blessings from Nandi. However, cracks have appeared on this monolithic statue, triggering alarm among conservationists and historians. Member of the Mysore Heritage Committee and historian Prof NS Rangaraju spotted the cracks on the statue, and immediately started work on a report that he will submit to the district administration, seeking action to prevent further damage to the historic statue. Rangaraju said that he had discovered cracks near the thighs of the mighty bull, and on the carved lips of the monolith. In a bid to restore to the statue some of the lustre it had lost owing to anointment by oil, and many such potions, the department of archaeology, museums and heritage had cleansed the Nandi with high-intensity water jets and chemicals. The technique was meant to purge the statue of residue of oil and other substances that have accumulated on the monolith. In the recent past, those who ascend the summit on a regular basis by climbing the steps have formed themselves into groups, and organised \u2018Mastakabhisheka\u2019, an anointment ceremony where the statue is bathed in solutions of turmeric, vermilion and other such sacred substances. Rangaraju told TOI that he spotted the fissures on the statue when he had been to Chamundi Hills, accompanied by a group of foreign students. \u201cI subsequently raised this issue at the meeting of the heritage committee, which was chaired by the Mysuru deputy commissioner, who directed the members to inspect the structure and submit a report,\u201d Rangaraju said. Equipped with a magnifying glass, and an excavation kit, Rangaraju revisited the Nandi statue, and observed that the black varnish applied on the statue had concealed the cracks. \u201cWhen the department of archaeology, museums and heritage washed the statue, the cracks revealed themselves rather prominently,\u201d he added. The historian added that there was no imminent threat to the statue. \u201cBut, to prevent further damage to the statue, the department of archaeology must restore the original colour, which serves the function of a protective coating. Also, the \u2018Mastakabhisheka\u2019 rituals must be stopped since the potions used to wash the statue are causing more harm than good,\u201d said Rangaraju. An official in the archaeology department told TOI that the statue had been cleansed at the behest of an expert who visited Chamundi Hills, and looked at the Nandi monolith. \u201cHe suggested that the statue should be cleaned, and we subsequently washed it in October 2017,\u201d the official said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

N Sundaram and Sons Fuel Station\u2019s decision to reserve a counter for women has drawn praise from across the social spectrum.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh.

Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Nearly 1,000 people from different walks of life in Mysuru have rushed to police here after Bengaluru-based IMA Jewels went bankrupt. Hundreds of Mysureans invested an estimated Rs 40 crore in IMA Jewels. Usually, banks offers an annual interest of around 7% whereas Ponzi schemes offer 2.5% monthly interest, which is around 30% annually. Many investors deposited their savings hoping to double their income in a short period but ended up in losing their money. Mysuru has witnessed several such incidents and people have filed police complaints about cheating by operators of chit funds and schemes. A banker claimed that information about such schemes spreads by word of mouth. The operators usually avoid being in touch with investors. They don't have any accountability or give any record for having received money. All their transactions are done without using banks so there's no money trail.  Lead Bank manager Venkatachalapathy B said: \"Though there are many cases of people getting cheated, they still fall prey to such schemes. People have become greedy and want to earn money quickly. Without doing background checks of operators, people blindly invest their money. Bankers have been conducting regular awareness programmes for people and talking about the benefits of investing in banks and prompt repayment of loans. Yet, they're swayed by lucrative offers and high returns by Ponzi scheme operators and end up disappointed.\" He added that the rate of interest is around 7% in banks whereas some operators offer a high rate of interest to lure more investors quickly. \"Recently, we educated farmers about loan schemes available to them and their benefits,\" he said. He admitted that the closure of popular Janata Deposit schemes by banks may have led to rise of Ponzi schemes or fraud firms. The Janata Deposit scheme suited the needs of many people, including businesspersons, professionals, daily-wage labourers, traders and homemakers as their investment was collected from their doorstep at regular intervals. Investors needn't visit banks to make deposits. As the scheme was misused by a few persons, the popular scheme was discontinued around six years ago, much to the disappointment of small investors. Since then, there is no such attractive deposit schemes in banks and that's why people are looking at private firms offering similar services.

In a bid to ensure that litter does not detract from the beauty of heritage structures, and other popular tourist hubs, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has, taking a cue from Singapore, decided to install robotic dustbins at these places. The waste generated in the city on a daily basis comes up to 400 tonnes. The figure includes the garbage accumulated in places such as Mysuru Palace, the zoo and other places that register a high density of tourists. Although 168 auto-tippers and 295 pushcarts in the service of MCC can be spotted at various corners of the city, with pourakarmikas crowding garbage into these vehicles, clearing waste remains a huge challenge for the civic agency. At tourist hotspots \u2013 Mysore Palace and Chamundi Hills, in particular \u2013 stray articles of waste are littered, much to the chagrin of the authorities concerned, keen on preserving the image of Mysuru as a \u2018Clean City\u2019. Empty plastic bottles, containers and discarded food packets are among the items that one stumbles upon at every second step in many of these places. Adding to which, food dumped at these places ends up attracting stray animals, an unwelcome intrusion for visitors looking to soak in the beauty of the iconic spots undisturbed. The robotic dustbins that the MCC has in mind will be equipped with an LCD screen, and sensors to monitor littering activity at tourist spots, said MCC health officer DG Nagaraj. \u201cThese dustbins, which can be found in Singapore and Saudi Arabia, are compact vehicles that can store up to three tonnes of garbage, which they will then transport to a location, from where they will be collected,\u201d Nagaraj told TOI. He added that the civic agency had identified 15 places across the city, where tourist density was highest, and the bins would be installed at these locations. Mysuru mayor Pushpalatha Jagganath pointed out that the idea to introduce robotic dustbins was an old proposal. Multiple private agencies, including a Bengaluru-based company, had approached MCC with the idea of installing them. \u201cWe had, at an earlier stage, decided to install them in Shantinagar. Now, it has been approved by the MCC health committee, and we have decided to install them in all the three assembly constituencies in the city \u2013 Krishnaraja, Narasimharaja and Chamaraja.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The urban life available at hand on the thoroughfares is very much a part of the tourist package, although it never finds mention on the itinerary. Given Mysuru\u2019s national, and burgeoning international reputation as a tourist destination, residents have for long rued the absence of lanes in the Heritage City \u2013 the many roads in the Central Business District of Mysuru, which have historic structures jostling one another lack those spaces where one can just rest, and take in life on the street. However, as part of the efforts to bolster Mysuru\u2019s tourism potential, efforts are under way to design some of these thoroughfares into destinations in themselves. Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) is keen on redesigning two streets in the CBD \u2013 Irwin Road and D Devaraja Urs Road \u2013 and many officials in the civic agency are in the process of studying some of the most prominent promenades in the world, including the TenderSURE roads developed in Bengaluru. The civic agency will decide on the best model for replication in Mysuru once it has thoroughly studied all roads under consideration. Although D Devaraja Urs Road was developed only in the 1980s to honour the memory of the former chief minister, in whose memory the thoroughfare was named, Irwin Road boasts a long and rich history. During the years when the erstwhile Mysore kingdom was a princely state of the British, Irwin Road was part of the Rajamaarga. MCC commissioner Shilpa Nag told TOI that the two roads in the heart of the city would be developed on a par with global standards. \u201cIrwin Road is already being widened. Both the roads will be upgraded, equipped with all the modern amenities. We have allocated funds for these projects in the budget,\u201d said Shilpa. The MCC chief said that the objective was to turn the two roads into major tourist attractions, to add to the already long list of hotspots dotting Mysuru. \u201cWe will choose the module best suited to Mysuru, and study the modalities of replicating it here,\u201d Shilpa added. Historian PV Nanjaraja Urs said that Irwin Road, named after the then Viceroy of India, was the original Rajamaarga of Mysuru. \u201cThe D Devaraja Urs Road, on the other hand, was conceived by BN Kengegowda, a two-time MLA and close aide of the former CM,\u201d Urs said. Residents, and students in particular, are pleased with the MCC\u2019s initiative. \u201cRoads that can be compared with some of the best in the world are the need of the hour for Mysuru.

Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president. Nadda has long experience of the party organisation as he was the in-charge of the party headquarters and is a popular figure.

The head constable\u2019s threat has shocked the family, the latter told the investigators as well as counsellers. According to sources, prime accused Padhma had taken the girl hostage on January 7. She was a friend of the head constable. The girl was subsequently raped by at least five men over a period of five months. The policeman also knew about the entire episode of money-lending to the girl\u2019s mother and then the girl being taken hostage by Padhma. Police have named five persons\u2013 four men, accusing them of rape, and one woman for procuring a minor girl and then misusing her. The head constable, however, is yet to be named in the FIR. So far, the police have arrested two persons and a search is on for the others. Deputy commissioner of police (law and order) M Muthuraju said the role of the head constable is being probed. Though there is no allegation against him in the rape incident, the cop is suspected to have some connection with money-lending, he said. Meanwhile, the child welfare committee, a quasi-judicial body, on Friday extended support to the family of the minor rape survivor by providing her family a temporary accommodation. CWC chairperson Kamala HT said the girl\u2019s family\u2014parents and grandfather\u2014requested them for a temporary shelter claiming they\u2019re feeling threatened after the incident. The family stayed in a town away from Mysuru city but now has been shifted to a recognized child care and protection centre in Mysuru. \u201cSince the minor girl didn\u2019t want to live separately from parents and there was no facility to keep the family together at a government centre, we have ensured them protection at a recognised centre,\u201d Kamala said. The district child protection officer on Friday extended an assistance of Rs 5,000 to the family towards temporary expenses as the family\u2019s financial condition is poor.

However, until very recently, many owners of two-wheelers, who may not have flinched at the angry snarl of a tiger, often scurried with fear at the wail of the Tiger Vans, which rode on Mysuru streets with a single purpose \u2013 to impound, and seize vehicles that were stationed in spaces where parking was strictly prohibited. These dreaded vans, however, have been decommissioned and their absence on the city\u2019s thoroughfares has not passed unnoticed. Although two-wheeler owners might rest easy now with the tiger vans no longer trundling along the city streets, traffic police have, by no means, taken their foot off the drive against illegal parking. Traffic cops have introduced a new system, wherein vehicles found in no-parking zones will be immobilised using a wheel-locking mechanism. The system, already in place in Bengaluru and other cities in Karnataka, has been launched, and successfully tested in Mysuru, with 40 cases being registered on a daily basis. In all, Mysuru traffic police have purchased as many as 500 of these locks, which have been distributed equally among the five traffic stations in the city \u2013 Narasimharaja, Krishnaraja, VV Puram, Devaraja and Siddarthanagar. Signalling the launch of the drive, KR police station launched \u2018Operation Wheel-Lock\u2019 in Agrahara, and on Basaveshwara Road on Monday. More than 50 vehicles, both cars and two-wheelers, were mechanically glued to those spots where, according to law, they had no business being. The sight of vehicle owners imploring cops to unlock their vehicles, and others acquiescing to pay the penalty for the offence to retake possession of their automobiles was commonplace. Besides locking two-wheelers parked in violation of regulations, the locks are being used to immobilise cars that have been caught breaking other traffic laws. Residents are a relieved lot with the disappearance of the tiger vans from the city\u2019s streets. Mahadevu, a resident of Mahadevapura, said that those in charge of impounding vehicles were often careless, resulting in damage to some of the automobiles. \u201cIn many cases, we owners were forced to pay for damages our two-wheelers sustained because of the poor manner in which they were handled by those manning the tiger vans, in addition to paying fines. The new solution, wherein our vehicles will be mechanically locked is much better. This way, we can rest assured knowing our vehicles are safe,\u201d Mahadevu told TOI. Once locked, owners will be allowed to use their vehicles only after they pay the penalty. If the owners fail to turn up within a stipulated time interval, the vehicles will be hauled to the nearest traffic police station. Owners forced to visit the station to get their vehicles will have to pay the fine, and the charge incurred by the cops to take the automobile to the station. Vehicle owners can also be fined for past offences in case the cops decide to pull out the history of the automobile in question. Mysuru city police commissioner KT Balakrishna told TOI that the new operation was currently in its experimental phase, but affirmed that the response to the newly adopted method had thus far been positive. \u201cThe drive has been successful. Motorists had expressed problems with Tiger Vans. The use of wheel-locks takes the possibility of underhanded activity. As of now, we have 500 of these wheel-locks. Based on the response, we will see if more are needed,\u201d Balakrishna said. Motorists travelling without vehicles finedResidents heading to work on Thursday morning were surprised to see a visible spurt in traffic monitoring activity on the city streets. Motorists travelling in Udayguru, Ghousia Nagar, Mandi Mohalla, Shantinagar without the required documents were penalised. Assistant commissioner of police Mohan led the drive.

Quoting data collated during the three-hour exercise, forest department authorities said that, against the 220 species of birds spotted at the sanctuary in March 2018, a mere 60 were spotted on Sunday. Notwithstanding the customary drop in the population of birds at Ranganathittu after the winter months, and the washing away of islets in the wake of floods that the region witnessed last year, the decline in the number of winged specimens at the aviary haven has left both forest department authorities and wildlife enthusiasts more than a trifle surprised. Nearly 20 volunteers, mostly from Bengaluru and Mysuru, participated in the census that was held under the supervision of the forest department at Ranganathittu. The department deputed two experts to accompany the volunteers during the census. A pair of binoculars was all the equipment that those involved in the census possessed. The fifth census held at Ranganathittu since March 2018, the participants employed both the nest counting, and total count methods. Among the birds spotted in huge numbers were the spot-billed pelican, painted stork, egret, stone plover, ibis and the baya weaver. Deputy conservator of forests (wildlife) KC Prashant Kumar, however, pointed out that the census was a regular exercise conducted by the department, with the assistance of volunteers thrice or four times every year. \u201cWe managed to identify 60 species of birds during the three-hour exercise,\u201d Kumar said. The DCF told TOI that a proposal to declare Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary a \u2018Wetland\u2019 would be sent to the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change. \u201cWe are presently in the process of collating all the necessary evidence, which will help the haven earn the tag,\u201d Kumar said. Efforts are also under way to get Ranganathittu tagged as a \u2018Ramsar Site\u2019. The Ramsar Convention is an inter-governmental treaty that aims at the conservation and management of wetlands, and nearly 90% of the countries that are members of the United Nations Organisation are signatories to it. Although it is the raucous cries of the many birds that one is reminded of at the mere mention of Ranganathittu, the sanctuary is home to several other species of animals such as the mugger crocodile, river otters and mahseer fish. Some of these species have been classified under \u2018endangered\u2019, while a few are staring at extinction. DH Tanuja, a bird watcher, with more than 25 years of experience in the field, told TOI that extensive knowledge of the aviary species was a prerequisite to being chosen as a volunteer for the bird census. \u201cThis is not the season when birds from across the globe come to Ranganathittu to nest. However, the flood in the Cauvery\u2019s catchment area has washed away nests, owing to which some of the migratory birds have stayed away,\u201d Tanuja said. The feathery archipelago Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary is 18km from Mysuru city in Srirangapatna taluk in Mandya district. The sanctuary is an archipelago with 25 islets and an estimated 40,000 winged guests arrive every year to nest at Ranganathittu. - Madiha Khanum Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Overcast weather in South Interior Karnataka an indicator of monsoon\u2019s imminent onset": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/overcast-weather-in-south-interior-karnataka-an-indicator-of-monsoons-imminent-onset/articleshow/69707332.cms", "time": "2019-06-09 09:01:00", "description": "MYSURU: Images of houses crashing to destruction, heaps of sand slushing over slopes and gushing on to roads and bridges collapsing in the aftermath of heavy rain last year remain fresh in the minds of both citizens and officials in the Kodagu district administration.

This is certainly one of the parameters that inform us that rain can be expected in the districts by Sunday evening,\u201d said Reddy. The KSNDMC director attributed the change in the climactic conditions to the imminence of the onset of the monsoon in South Interior Karnataka.

Reddy was quick to add that the onset of the monsoon could be confirmed only by verifying a certain set of weather systems. \u201cWe are waiting for these patterns to be confirmed,\u201d he added.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister said an active and effective opposition is a necessity in a democracy and pointed out that a well- argued and factual criticism of the government strengthens democracy. \"Sometimes such positive contributions are not noticed as they do not get high TRPs,\" he said. Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future? What new has she brought in?\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Horoscope Today": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/astrology/horoscope/horoscope-today-june-18-2019-check-astrological-prediction-for-sagittarius-capricorn-aquarius-pisces-and-other-signs/articleshow/69834705.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Mysuru on piles of Garbage": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/mysuruonpilesofgarbage/articleshow/66113139.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Whatsapp Feature": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/how-this-new-feature-may-save-whatsapp-users-from-embarrassment/articleshow/69834812.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Install fireproof and huge garbage bins in Mysuru": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/installfireproofandhugegarbagebinsinmysuru/articleshow/67507978.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Moulvis must speak up and declare such companies as haram: Expert": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/moulvis-must-speak-up-and-declare-such-companies-as-haram-expert/articleshow/69765903.cms", "time": "2019-06-13 09:20:00", "description": "MYSURU/KOLAR: The IMA Group scam has hit hundreds of people, especially from the Muslim community, hard in Kolar district. Many from the community had invested their savings in the group and now wonder if they would ever see their money again. Most are illiterate locals from Malur taluk, although others from Kondasettyhalli, Masthi and other Muslimdominated areas had also put hard-earned money into the company. They say the company appointed three agents in the taluk and the agents talked people into investing. IMA founder-owner Mansoor Ali Khan had reportedly donated crores of rupees for the construction of Shadi Mahal in Malur. The mahal is being built on wakf property in Kumbarapet, Malur and construction began in 2017, but was halted after ex-MLA KS Manjunath Gowda was defeated in the 2018 elections. \u2018Fatwa needed\u2019The impact of the scam was also felt in Muslim-dominated pockets in Mysuru and Hassan districts, with many travelling all the way to Bengaluru to invest in the company. Experts from the community feel the need of the hour is to create economic opportunities for women. Muzaffar Assadi, a popular political scientist and special officer of Raichur University, said a multi-pronged strategy is needed to protect the poor from these kinds of scams. \u201cMoulvis must issue fatwas against these kinds of schemes saying they are haram and not halal,\u201d Assadi said. \u201cA majority of investors are from poor families, who had put their money in hoping of a better future. Now all their dreams are dashed. Moulvis must take the lead role. It is the best way to keep people from the community away from these kinds of scams.\u201d While fatwas are an immediate response, Assadi said educating people from the community is a long- term strategy to empower women from the community. \u201cWe need to implement short-term strategies including creation of women self-help groups, launching cottage industries and industries owned, operated and run by women. All these will drive people away from fly-by-night companies,\u201d he said. Aisha M Sheriff, professor, BN Bahadur Institute of Management Studies, who also served as vice-chancellor in-charge of University of Mysore (UoM), said as per tenets of the faith, community members cannot give or take interest. \u201cThis led to the concept of profit for investment,\u201d Aisha said. \u201cAs a result companies with questionable credentials, which are not registered with regulatory agencies like RBI or SEBI, mushroomed.

Kerekamegowda inaugurated a workshop to prepare two lakh seed balls to be used in barren lands. The event was organized by Janachethana Trust and Swadeshi Jagaran Manch at the Gopalaswamy Shishuvihara Institutions. Addressing students, Kerekamegowda said he has built lakes for posterity and it is the responsibility of the youngsters to safeguard them. \u201cEvery kid should urge their parents to build lakes. In the recent days, there is deficit rainfall due to lack of clouding. Lakes and rivers are going dry. In order to save these waterbodies, more and more trees have to be planted, facilitating clouds, and it is the responsibility of the youngsters to plant trees, the environmentalist said. Teaching students how to build lakes, Kerekamegowda said lakes can be built in those areas where the land is wet after a series of rainfall. Soon after it starts raining, the land is evenly drenched and the soil is soft and in those areas lakes can be constructed. Earthmovers make things easy, he added. On the occasion, president of Janachethana Trust Prasanna N Gowda said rivers are drying because smaller canals are going dry. Lakshman Teertha in Hunsur taluk is the living example. In order to save rivers, canals have to be saved first. The seed ball campaign is necessary. In Nanjangud, over two lakh seed balls of 250 varieties are being planted along with 10,000 saplings, Prasanna said.

After inspecting under construction houses for the victims of the Kodagu flood victims, Harshika, a native of the hilly district, had voiced reservations about the standard of the structures. Mahesh, however, did not take too kindly to her remarks. \u201cShe (Harshika) is a film actress. How much does she know about construction? I will agree with her observations on cinema, which is her occupation and her domain of expertise. But when did she become an expert in house construction? I will take into account the opinions of those who are experts in this field,\u201d Mahesh said. \u2018I am an engineering graduate\u2019Harshika said that she had given voice to her concerns after going through photographs of some of the newly built houses in Kodagu. \u201cI felt worried when I saw that the roofs of some of the houses were just sheets, and the ventilation in these structures was very poor. I am of the opinion that the houses the state government is building for the victims of floods, they must be of the highest quality. The self-esteem of the beneficiaries must be given due consideration. We will feel great if the state government constructs really good houses for the victims,\u201d said Harshika. Rejoining Mahesh about her lack of expertise in construction, the actress said, \u201cI want to inform the minister that I have a degree in engineering, and passed with distinction. Besides, I am from Kodagu, and this alone entitles me to question what is happening in my district.

The junction, counted among the busiest in the city owing to its location on the Outer Ring Road (ORR), witnessed regular gridlock, and the grade separator was touted as the only possible solution to the persistent problem. Although the flyover has greatly eased vehicular movement, regular bus commuters in Hinkal and surrounding areas have had to bear the cost of progress \u2013 the loss of the bus shelter that was demolished to make way for the grade separator. Passengers are now forced to wait on the road for buses with no roof to protect them from the scorching Sun, as was the case these past months or the torrential rain, which is now a near daily occurrence in the Heritage City. The lack of a dedicated bus shelter is also a problem for commuters alighting from the buses, since they have to be watchful of speeding vehicles in case the bus stops away farther away from the kerb. Work on the flyover at Hinkal Junction took nearly two-and-a-half years to complete, and throughout that period, the passengers had no option but to allow the dust to hover around their shoulders. Mysore Urban Development Authority (Muda), which was the overseeing agency for the project, had entrusted the job to Bengaluru-based PJB Engineering Company. The flyover, constructed at a cost of Rs 19.83 crore, was envisioned at the junction that records traffic flow of up to 37,677 passenger car unit (PCU). Besides those who travel within the city, those going or arriving from Kerala, Kodagu and Bengaluru alight near the Hinkal Junction. They have also had to suffer owing to the lack of an adequate transit facility. Kannada writer and Hinkal resident BG Rangegowda said that it was an unpleasant experience, waiting for buses at the junction. \u201cIt is extremely difficult for the public to wait for buses when there is no shelter,\u201d Rangegowda told TOI. Worse still, Rangegowda\u2019s entreaties to the Mysuru district in-charge minister GT Devegowda and Muda officials have elicited no response. \u201cThe district in-charge minister must take up the initiative and order the construction of the bus shelter, and he should disburse money from the MLA\u2019s Local Area Development (LAD) funds,\u201d he added. Muda commissioner PS Kantharaju told TOI that he was unaware about the bus shelter having been demolished for the construction of the flyover. \u201cI will inspect the junction, and ensure that a new bus shelter is constructed to ensure the residents are not inconvenienced,\u201d said Kantharaju.

English has already been introduced as the medium of instruction in a 1,000 state-run schools, and this is a dangerous trend. Worse still, directions have been issued to hike admissions if there is a spike in demand.

What sets the initiative, the brainchild of Pratham Mysore, apart is that students of both schools will have equal access to the facilities of the other institution, thus ensuring that the students in state-run organisations are not deprived of modern infrastructure and other key facilities. The edge that private schools have in infrastructure is what makes the chasm between private and government institutions as evident as it is. However, the novel initiative will render this advantage inutile. Sources in the NGO said that Excel Public School in Koorgalli Industrial Area will be paired with the MG Koppal Government Higher Primary School. Two other private schools have approached the NGO, expressing their desire to be a part of the special programme, and discussions are under way to take them further. Excel Public School principal KG Mathew told TOI, \u201cBesides having visited the school in person, I have deputed two teachers from Excel to the government institution. We have a set of plans that we are keen on implementing at the government school, and will start work on them soon.\u201d Mathew said that, besides a thorough assessment of the requirements of the government school, students from our institution will have to be sensitised about the conditions and realities in which their counterparts in the state-run schools study. \u201cThis is an opportunity for them to learn about the harsh realities of society. We will be able to instill social values among them. This is one of the reasons why we agreed to be a part of the initiative,\u201d said Mathew. Ashvini Ranjan, managing trustee of the NGO, echoed the sentiments expressed by Mathew. \u201cChildren studying in private schools may not be aware of the conditions prevailing in a government school. Nor are they likely to be aware of the living conditions of government schoolchildren. This is an effort to bring students from different ends of the social spectrum together. We hope that more private schools will come forward to be a part of the initiative,\u201d Ranjan said. The other projects include encouraging students to correspond with one another through letters, said Ranjan. \u201cThis will ensure a continuous conversation between them, and each child will learn something from the other,\u201d he added. Sheshadri Anandrao, chief executive officer of Pratham Mysore, said that proven academic credentials, infrastructure and facilities for extra and co-curricular activities were among the parameters that were assessed while choosing the private schools for the initiative. \u201cThe initiative will take flight in July. Initially, as many as 50 children from the government school will be paired with as many in the private institution. Students will, by themselves, serve as one another\u2019s mentor,\u201d said Ranjan, exuding confidence of the programme continuing and more schools coming under the umbrella of the initiative. Principal of the Government higher Primary School, MG Koppal Mallaiah said that representatives from Pratham Mysore had visited the institution. He confirmed to TOI that the school had been paired with Excel Public School, and was eager to see the initiative reach its functional stage. Established in 2002, Pratham Mysore is active in as many as 125 education blocks across the state.

Across education blocks in Mysuru district, more than 50% of the RTE seats are yet to be filled, prompting DPI to announce that two additional rounds will be conducted to fill all the vacancies. In all, 969 seats were available under RTE quota across the district, 675 were allotted during the counseling process.
