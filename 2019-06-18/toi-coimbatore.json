At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Sokkanur, Kappalankarai chosen for income doubling project": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/sokkanur-kappalankarai-chosen-for-income-doubling-project/articleshow/69795805.cms", "time": "2019-06-15 04:49:00", "description": "Coimbatore: With regard to the doubling of farmer\u2019s income project in the district, two villages within Kinathukidavu-Kappalankarai and Sokkanur-have been chosen.

A Mohammed Hussain, 27, and A Shahjahan, 27, of Ukkadam and Y Sheik Shafiullah, 35, of Karumbukkadai, arrested on Saturday, were medical representatives. Shafiullah is the younger brother of Y Sheik Hidayathullah, who was arrested by the NIA on June 14.

The 72-year-old, who was arrested in connection with February 1998 Coimbatore serial blasts and who was in jail for more than nine years before being acquitted, accused the BJP of trying to tarnish the Muslim community\u2019s name and misusing the NIA. The arrests were made based on a complaint filed by Podanur sub-inspector P Udhaya Kumar with inspector P Maheswaran, saying an informer had alerted him about the three meeting secretly in different places in the city and discussing ISIS agenda to unleash terror attacks by ploughing explosive-laden trucks into milling crowds, especially at temples and churches. The three, who used to euologise Zahran Hashim, allegedly targeted some police officers in the intelligence wing, the complaint said.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense.

Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath.

Divya in chat with Shantha Thiagarajan:What were your priorities when you took charge as the collector of the Nilgiris? When I took charge, one thing that occurred first to me was environmental conservation. I knew that this would be the greatest challenge I would face as the collector. What were the measures you took in the district to conserve environment\u2026?Right now, we have banned sinking borewells and using earthmovers. We have banned plastics which Supriya Sahu had introduced during her tenure here as collector. But over the years, its momentum has slowed down. We have now implemented it seriously. What do you think of the \u2018Green Award\u2019 bestowed on you by the government?I indeed dedicate the award to the people of the Nilgiris. With so much of involvement and cooperation, the people made it happen. Because an order is easy to pass but the people\u2019s participation in this task is tremendous. Without their active support and cooperation, I don\u2019t think this would have become possible at all. I think the sense of belonging of the people here matters a lot. About the transformation in the Nilgiris\u2026. The transformation we see in the district is because of the people. We pass an order and enforce it. The entire cooperation comes from the people. The only thing that I have in my mind is no further degradation should be allowed in the hills during my tenureWhat next for the Nilgiris..?Higher-level planning needs to be there. It should be different from other hill stations. A special status should be there about its fragile ecosystem. I have realized that given its significance, the Nilgiris cannot have the same conservation plans that other hill stations have You mean fresh policies to be enacted\u2026?Policy is in place. For example, in a place where the gradient is more than 33 degrees, constructions should not happen. But still people manipulate the gradient or the identified vulnerable areas and apply for building license. If the applications are rejected, they might go for unauthorized constructions. Manpower here is limited to check illegal constructions. But we try our level best to maintain that discipline here.

They said the population of native cattle breeds, specifically the Malai Kongu Maadu, had dropped drastically after farmers were banned from grazing their cattle in reserve forest zones. They also demanded that the price at which Aavin buys A2 milk from farmers be raised to encourage more farmers to breed and maintain native cow breeds. Farmers, led by the Kongu Patteeshwaran Ghoshala, have requested the collector to make the forest department again issue \u201cpatti passes\u201d to cattle farmers. \u201cThis is a pass that the forest department was issuing to allow us to graze our cattle in forest areas and lands. Around 2000-01, there were nearly 1.5 lakh to two lakh Malai Kongu cows in villages in and around Thondamuthur including Madhampatti, Karadimadai and Viraliyur,\u201d said T Shanmugam a member of the Ghoshala. \u201cHowever, in 2002, when the forest department withdrew our patti passes and banned our and our cattle\u2019s entry into forest areas, many farmers panicked and sold thousands of their native cows to slaughterhouses. We hardly have a few thousand cows of the native breed left,\u201d he said. The farmers said the government should incentivise rearing of native breeds of cattle. \u201cWhile one way is to allow us to graze in forest areas, the other one is to make Aavin buy A2 milk from farmers for at least Rs 50 to Rs 60 per litre. They currently buy it for Rs 20 per litre, which is the cost for A1 milk. They have only one category called milk,\u201d said Shanmugam. \u201cThey should also ban construction on hill area conservation lands and foothills of mountains, because it eventually takes away greenery and open lands which can be used for grazing,\u201d he added. The cattle farmers said that the ban on cattle has affected their environment in multiple ways. \u201cWhenever our cattle used to graze in the forest fringes, wild animals never came out of the forest. We have never seen wild elephants, bears and leopards. Now they have begun coming to our villages,\u201d the petition said. \u201cThe cow\u2019s urine and dung were so beneficial to the soil that the forests were thicker and they used to eat grass so well, that fresh grass kept growing.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Professors and students of Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College\u2019s nanotechnology department have found a procedure to use graphenesingle layer of carbon atoms that is just one atom-thickas a sensor to detect phosgene. \u201cThe method we have devised would be cost-effective as it involves graphene, a form of carbon, which is easily available. Our method also is efficient as it can detect small traces of the toxic gas in the atmosphere, up to parts per billion,\u201d said head of the department T Daniel Thangadurai, who led the research team. Graphene is converted from inert state to active state by adding diamino naphthalene, an organic compound. Once this is done, it becomes fluorescent on getting exposed to phosgene. This transformation of graphene from its original colour to fluorescent can be used as a method to detect phosgene leak. Human exposure to phosgene will result in death, said Thangadurai. \u201cWhile existing methods to detect phosgene leak, like spectroscopy are expensive, the graphene method is cheaper,\u201d he told TOI. \u201cBesides the industrial sector, where phosgene is used in the manufacture of pesticides and polymers, the research finding is likely to find takers in other areas like defence, where the toxic gas can be used in chemical weaponry, as it was used in World War I. Exposure to phosgene in trace amounts would also lead to cancer in human beings. With the help of this method, traces of phosgene in human body can be detected,\u201d Thangadurai added. The project has been going on for a year and the results were published last month. The team is now looking to make a portable phosgene detector.

Addressing a meeting in Guntur on Monday, Pawan said that the future of the state did not mean the future of Lokesh and Jagan but it was the future of the people. \u201cThe space on the state\u2019s political stage is not TDP\u2019s and YSRC\u2019s property as youth and women are eager to bring change through Jana Sena.\u201d \u201cTDP had lost moral right to rule the state as chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had no control over his legislators who indulged in illegal activities,\u201d Pawan said adding that he jumped into the political arena to bring in a change in the lives of commoners. \u201cWe supported TDP and BJP in the last elections with a hope to transform the state. Unfortunately, both of them have shattered our dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cGuntur city has been left in a lurch despite located a few kilometres away from the capital city. The entire city has been dug out in the guise of laying underground drainage scheme and left without repair. How shocking it is to see 30 people dying of diarrhoea in a city like Guntur? Is it not the failure of the state government? Opposition leader Jaganmohan Reddy is equally responsible for the tragedy as he never dared to question the government by going to the assembly,\u201d he said. He further said they would construct apartments exclusively for Muslims in the city. He appealed to people to support his candidates Chandrasekhar (Guntur West), Zia-Ur-Rehman (East) and MP candidate Bonaboina Srinivas Yadav in the elections, Pawan said they fielded a BC candidate Srinivasa Yadav whereas TDP and YSRC both have given tickets to their own communities.

Relatives claimed that the siddha medicines were the reason for G Sathyapriya\u2019s kidney failure and demanded action against the siddha practitioner who treated her. Police said Sathyapriya, a final year BA (political science) student at Government Arts College, had menstrual problems. Her father R Ganeshan, a daily wage labourer from Netaji Nagar at Kulathupalayam, took her to Manonmani Siddha Hospital at Selvapuram on January 20, where siddha practitioner Gurunathan gave medicines to Sathyapriya. After taking few doses of the medicine, Sathyapriya\u2019s face allegedly swelled. Gurunathan changed the medicine but her health condition deteriorated and she was admitted in a private hospital at Kuniyamuthur. She was again referred to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) on April 22, where she was diagnosed with kidney failure. Meanwhile, Ganeshan lodged a complaint with the Selvapuram police against Gurunathan. Police inquiry revealed that Gurunathan was not a quack. A team of siddha medical practitioners has collected the medicines given to Sathyapriya and sent them to a lab. They are waiting for the result. Meanwhile, Sathyapriya died without responding to the treatment at the CMCH on Monday. Her relatives blocked the road in front of Government Arts College road here, demanding the arrest of Gurunathan. However, the Selvapuram police registered a case under section 174 (suspicious death) of the CrPC. After the postmortem, the dead body was handed over to the family members on Monday afternoon.

As per the scheme, the university will closely work with farmers to identify the problems and provide solutions in terms of better varieties, required equipment, irrigation and marketing. The university has selected at least one village per district to implement the scheme. In Coimbatore, Kinathukadavu and Pogalur have been selected. While Pongalur has been selected in Tirupur district, Samakuttaipatti in Salem and Thambatty in the Nilgiris have been selected. TNAU\u2019s planning and monitoring head Venkatapirabu said, \u201cThe villages were chosen based on certain criteria like agriculture being the main source of livelihood, presence of many farmers belonging to SC and ST community, farmers being cooperative and receptive to intervention, presence for scope of intervention and the village having basic infrastructure like road access.\u201d \u201cThe villages should be a mix of a hilly area, rainfed area, garden land and one wetland,\u201d he said.Around 160 scientists will be working on the scheme which will mainly focus on farmers being able to achieve their potential yield, learning to market it well so they also realize their potential income. \u201cWe believe farmers have the potential to double their yield and income,\u201d he said. TNAU vice-chancellor N Kumar said, \u201cFour departments of the university have been roped in for the scheme \u2014 crop management, horticulture, agricultural engineering and marketing.\u201d The first step in the scheme would be to conduct interactive meetings between farmers and scientists to understand the issues they face and find solutions. \u201cIt includes touching base with the local panchayat, key informants and influencers and understanding the social background. Meanwhile, we will also do a baseline survey in the village to understand the soil conditions, crops being cultivated, main sources of income, water availability, other weaknesses and what we must initially do to help them,\u201d Venkatapirabu said.Once all the assistance is provided and farmers see a significant increase in their yield per hectare, the focus will move on to storing and marketing it, so they can achieve their potential income. \u201cFor this we will have to invest and create cold storage facilities, general storage facilities, link them to more online trading communities, create some non-farm income, provide them value addition opportunities among others,\u201d he added.TNAU has approached NABARD for funding for this scheme, but they are yet to confirm.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The duo recently did the challenging trek to the Everest base camp (EBC) at the altitude of around 5,400m and are now on top of the world! An excited Daga begins, \u201cWe always wanted to touch the feet of Mount Everest. We started our trek on May 12th and reached the Base Camp on 23rd. During the 12-day trek, we met many groups from different parts of the world. Since both of us were vegetarians, there was a slight discomfort with food. We stuck to two bread toasts in the morning and dal bhat with vegetables for lunch. Even small experiments went wrong. For instance, I had hot chocolate during the trek, which didn\u2019t really go well with me as it was made of yak milk. Apart from the diet, the clothing was also important. We had to wear at least five layers of protective clothing. It was quite an inspiring journey,\u201d says Daga. Gupta echoes his sentiments. \u201cYes, it tests your endurance. Since we live in Coimbatore where the minimum temperature does not drop more than 20 degrees, it was very difficult getting used to the weather below -15 degrees. The route was quite challenging with ridges and suspension bridges. Many who had accompanied us suffered from high altitude sickness and had to be airlifted. But, the accommodation was good. But, due to the excitement, we couldn\u2019t really get a good sleep.\u201d Interestingly, both Daga and Gupta are not professional trekkers. \u201cWe have only been running, walking, jogging and cycling in the evenings. After we decided to do this trek, we climbed the Marudhamalai and Vellingiri hills.\u201d Talking about the picturesque moments during the arduous journey, Daga says, \u201cEvery moment was breathtaking and needed to be captured on the camera. The pathways were extremely narrow and there are many deep gorges as well. During the trek, a fellow trekker fell on me but I managed to save myself. The snow-capped mountains were a visual treat.\u201d It was during this time that there was a huge traffic jam on the mountain, which eventually turned into a death zone for many. \u201cThe base camp was heavily crowded. There were more than 200 tents when we had camped there. Once you reach there, you need to get used to the oxygen level. For the summit, you will be provided two bottles of oxygen. You have to strive to push yourself with that. Climbers cling to a rope and trudge towards the highest peak. The ascent and descent happens on the same lane which leads to the jam. If you wait at the same place, for a long time there is a risk of getting frostbites and falling sick. And if these routes are vertical, it gets even more challenging. The Sherpas do come along with you, but you need to push yourself. Sometimes when the temperature rises, the ice starts melting & the ridge starts widening. This can also lead to accidents. And the higher you climb, the oxygen level plummets. oxygen is irreplaceable at that point,\u201d says Gupta. He adds, \u201cThere should be strict protocols when it comes to climbing a mountain like Everest. People should be fit and have the experience. There should be a cap on the numbers as well. Permissions should be given only to the eligible ones.\u201d Meanwhile, the duo is celebrating their hike with gusto. \u201cThere were tears in my eyes when I met my family and friends.

The students were constantly monitored to ensure that they do not drop out again,\u201d said M Thangavel, director of the organization. Compared to girls in rural areas, it is the boys, who are often forced to quit schools. More than 65% of the dropouts from the blocks were boys, Thangavel said. \u201cTo understand the reasons behind it, we conducted a study in the blocks. We chose the blocks as several child marriages were reported from there. Child labour was also rampant at these three places.\u201d \u201cWe had selected 20 villages in Nambiyur block and started children resource centres (CRC) in each village to assist the children two years ago. Apart from guiding them through their academic syllabus, other assistance like counselling and life skill guidance were given to them. In the last two years, no child marriage, no child labour and no school dropouts were reported from those villages,\u201d Thangavel said. The NGO has now identified 60 villages to launch the CRCs. \u201cThe main reason for dropout among boys is the poor financial situation in their families.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

They said the population of native cattle breeds, especially the Malai Kongu Maadu, had dropped drastically after farmers were banned from grazing their cattle in reserve forest zones. They also demanded that the price at which Aavin buys A2 milk from farmers should be tripled, to encourage more farmers to breed and maintain native cow breeds. Farmers led by the Kongu Patteeshwaran Ghoshala have requested the collector to make the forest department again issue \u201cpatti passes\u201d to cattle farmers. \u201cThis is a pass that the forest department was issuing to allow us to graze our cattle in forest areas and lands. Around the year 2000-\u201901, there were nearly 1.5 lakh to 2 lakh Malai Kongu Maadu cows across villages in and around Thondamuthur, including Madhampatti, Karadimadai and Viraliyur,\u201d T Shanmugam, a member of the Ghoshala, said. \u201cHowever, in 2002, when the forest department withdrew our patti passes and banned ours and our cattle\u2019s entry in forest areas, many farmers panicked and sold thousands of their native cows to slaughter houses. We have a few thousand cows of the native breed left,\u201d he said. The farmers said the government should incentivize rearing of native breeds of cattle. \u201cWhile one way is to allow us to graze in forest areas, the other one is to make Aavin buy A2 milk from us farmers for at least Rs 50 to Rs 60 per litre. They currently buy it for Rs 20 per litre, which is the cost for A1 milk. They have only one category called milk,\u201d Shanmugam said. \u201cThey should also ban construction on hill area conservation lands and foothills of mountains, because it eventually takes away greenery and open lands which can be used for grazing,\u201d he added. The cattle farmers said the ban on cattle has affected their environment in multiple ways. \u201cWhenever our cattle used to graze in the forest fringes, wild animals never came out of the forest. We have never seen wild elephants, bears and leopards. Now, they have begun coming inside our villages. The grazing cow\u2019s urine and dung was so beneficial to the soil that the forests were thicker, and they used to eat grass so well that fresh grass kept growing. Now we have less greenery and temperature is higher. We have also had to start using chemical pesticides, because we don\u2019t have enough cow urine to make biopesticides,\u201d the petition said.

I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Due to indiscriminate use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, microbes and earthworms were destroyed and the soil has become lifeless, said joint director of agriculture S Banumathi., who spoke at the inaugural function. \u201cCrops cultivated in such soil don\u2019t have good growth and fall prey to insects and diseases.

A total of 30 soil testing laboratories and 16 mobile soil testing laboratories have been functioning across the state for the purpose. A total of 9.61lakh soil samples were tested in the two phases.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

In this year\u2019s \u2018World Continence Week\u2019, which is observed from June 17 to June 23, the theme is \u2018incontinence is no laughing matter\u2019. An overactive bladder (OAB), once considered a medical condition affecting the elderly population, is now being seen among younger men and women. \u201cOveractive bladder is a problem where the bladder-storage functions become impaired, resulting in a sudden urge to urinate. In some cases, the urge may be so strong that it can result in leaks before you can reach the bathroom,\u201d urologist at city-based Vedanayagam Hospital Dr Ganesh Gopalakrishnan said. \u201cIf you\u2019re using the bathroom more than about eight times in 24-hour and if the urge keeps increasing, this could be a sign that there is something wrong,\u201d he said. Some patients, with OAB, experience leakages when they laugh, sneeze or even jump because it puts pressure on the bladder. \u201cMost people who suffer from urinary incontinence live with it because they believe there is nothing they can do about it,\u201d urologist at GKNM Hospital Dr K S Vengetesh said. \u201cHowever, people hesitate to discuss it with doctors due to embarrassment. It often leads to low self-esteem and social isolation,\u201d a doctor said. However, another urologist said patients need to be aware that an overactive bladder is a common medical condition and can be treated or managed well. \u201cWith OAB, the bladder works overtime, contracting more often than it should and at inappropriate times. The bladder muscles seem to give wrong messages to the brain causing the bladder to feel fuller than it is. The bladder contracts too early when the bladder is not very full,\u201d Dr C L Dinakaran of Arun Urology Hospital said. OAB can be managed with lifestyle changes, diet, medication and even surgery. \u201cIt is advisable to limit your caffeine intake, refrain from alcohol and spicy food,\u201d Dr Vengetesh said.
