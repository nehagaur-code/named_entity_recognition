Following certain allegations concerning teak saplings, a charge memo was issued to the petitioner in October 2011 under Rule 17(a) of Tamil Nadu Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules. Though the petitioner denied the allegations, the conservator of forests, Madurai circle, passed an order imposing recovery for the loss incurred by the state exchequer. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the loss occurred on account of natural calamities and therefore his client was not liable to compensate it. Justice S M Subramaniam observed that such natural calamities have not been established and there was no finding in this regard by the competent authority. He observed that in the departmental disciplinary proceedings, the explanation submitted by the delinquent alone is to be considered with regard to the records available and final orders to be passed by the competent authority. This being the procedure followed, the court is of the opinion that the findings arrived by the competent authority that there was financial loss to the state exchequer cannot now be re-adjudicated.

On the other hand, the fishermen said that exporters who bought a kilogram of export quality prawns (30 pieces per kg) for Rs 650 before the ban began had hinted that they would be able to pay only half the price, to the disappointment of fishermen.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Petitioner T Pitchaiah was holding the post of PIO under Right to Information (RTI) Act in the Tiruvarur collectorate and had furnished certain information to an information seeker. Not satisfied with it, the information seeker approached the information commission to punish the petitioner. The directions issued by the commission were also not adhered to and in this regard, the counsel who appeared for the petitioner pointed out that a notice was received by the petitioner on December 8, 2008 asking him to appear on December 3, 2008 ! The counsel submitted that the successor of the petitioner who was holding the post of PIO failed to appear before the commission to produce the records. Thus, the petitioner cannot be blamed for the omission committed by his successor. The counsel further submitted that no notice or opportunity was given to the petitioner to be heard before being slapped the penalty and hence the penalty order issued in 2010 must be quashed. Justice S M Subramaniam observed that the court was of the considered opinion that no man should be punished unheard. \u201cStatute provides that the central PIO or the state PIO as the case may be shall be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard before any penalty is imposed on him,\u201d the judge said. Hence, the order of imposing penalty is not only improper but in violation to clause of Section 20 of RTI Act. The counsel who appeared for the petitioner brought to the notice of the court that the petitioner had already retired from service and now was a pensioner and therefore remanding the matter would not serve any purpose. The court noted that the additional government pleader was unable to establish that such a notice had already been provided to the petitioner before issuing the order of penalty. The court observed that this being the legal principle to be followed and the fact that the petitioner had already attained the age of superannuation and allowed to retire, no purpose would be served in remanding the matter now after a lapse of many years.

The rural lot, who took part in the sample survey on the challenges faced by girls and women, rated them as the least important of the issues in a list of 12. For them, the issue of top concern is the poor financial conditions forcing adolescent girls to work as camp coolies in spinning mills. This is followed by child marriage or early marriage. Women\u2019s opinion getting ignored at home as well as in the community in decision making was rated as the third most important issue. The survey was conducted by five NGOs \u2013 Navajeevan Trust (NJT) Tirunelveli, NEEDS in Virudhunagar, People\u2019s Action for Development (PAD) Ramanathapuram, Manushi in Pudukkottai \u2013 coordinated by Centre for Social Education and Development (CSED), Tirupur. Denial or lack of importance for higher education and lack of recognition for work done by women are among the more serious issues pointed out by the 3,368 people who took part in the survey in four southern districts. This is followed by physical, emotional, sexual and other forms of violence. While dowry-related issues such as postponement of marriages and broken marriages was voted 7th, disparity in wages, lack of recognition and exploitation of their labour were voted as the 6th issue of concern. Less attention to health care needs and suffering from anaemia and malnourishment is 8th. The NGOs conducted the opinion poll in Tirunelveli (774 people), Virudhunagar (980), Ramanathapuram (759) and Pudukottai (855) from May 10 to June 3. Listing out the various forms of discrimination and oppression faced by women and girls in a ballot paper, the villagers were asked to choose them based on a priority based on the seriousness in the order best known to them. To help them make their choice better, posters with pictorial representation of the 12 issues were displayed where the survey was conducted in those villages. They were asked to choose the top five serious issues from a list of 12. The folded sheets had to be deposited in a ballot box. Respondents were in the aged group of above 12 years and were divided into five age categories. As many as 2,196 (65.21%) people who took part in the opinion poll were girls and women, while the remaining 1,172 were men (34.79%). Most of the participants were in the age group of 25-40 years, followed by adults (24.64%) who were between 41 and 60 years of age. CSED executive director C Nambi said that the survey was aimed at bringing to light the partiality and violence faced by girls, adolescent women and women at home, education institutions, work place and in the society.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath. The Pro tem speaker ruled that the members stick to the format provided. After this, the members of BJP started adding 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' after end of every oath. Some of the prominent names who took oath from Madhya Pradesh included K P Yadav who defeated Jyotiraditya Scindia, Rakesh Singh, Ramakant Bhargava and Nakul Nath.

The incident took place in a village near Periyakulam on Friday night. Baskaran suffered an injury below his eye when a stone hit him. He was initially treated at the Theni Medical College Hospital, before being shifted to a private hospital in Madurai. He was later shifted to a private eye hospital. A doctor treating him said that it was a minor injury and there was no threat to his eyesight. \u201cWe have advised hospitalization for one more day just to ensure that he takes rest. We are treating him to reduce pain and swollen muscles,\u201d said the doctor. Higher police officers including ADGP Jayanth Murali, Madurai city police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham and south zone IG K P Shanmuga Rajeswaran visited the injured SP in hospital.

We have arrested five people so far and searching for a few more,\u201d said inspector Mathana Kala. Around 400 police personnel have been deployed in the village and the suspects are being combed. Police said that it all began when a police constable identified as Siranjeevi attached to Devadhanapatti police station, and hailing from Saruthupatti village, claimed that he was attacked by some members of an intermediate caste from Lakshmipuram at Pomminayakkanpatti. This created tension and as a result the villagers staged a blockade on the Theni-Periyakulam road seeking the arrest of the \u2018suspects\u2019. \u201cThe police constable made a false claim to give a communal twist. Inquiry is underway to find out the reason. While there has been mounting tension between the two castes in the last three days, the villagers began a protest,\u201d a police officer said. As traffic was affected on the road, SP Baskaran along with others arrived at the spot. After a while, when things went out of control and the protesters started pelting stones resulting in injuries to the police personnel. Police had to resort to a lathicharge after the stone pelting incident to disburse the crowd. Adequate strength has been deployed in all vulnerable areas and things are under control. There will not be any further escalation of tension, said deputy superintendent police, Periyakulam range, V Arumugam. Police sources said the tension between two castes in Periakulam region started on June 12, when a couple of youngsters from scheduled caste were questioned by members of the intermediate caste from Lakshmipuram for speeding through the street. While the duo left, they came back later and attacked those who questioned them. This led to people from Lakshmipuram stage a road blockade on June 13. They reportedly attacked a couple of students belonging to the scheduled caste from another village, when they were passing through the protest.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The protestors claimed that a few trees were already been cut and a few others pruned, with around 150 more now facing axe. A video clip on the environmental problem it can cause shot at Bypass Road has already viral on social media. The agitators said they did not see the permission letter obtained for felling trees despite calling for the same for long. They even prevented the contractor from going ahead with felling trees a couple of times in recent weeks asking them to produce permission letter. Sridhar Nedunchezhiyan, of Mannin Marangal Padhukappu Iyakkam, said that they are not up against development and road projects but demand the projects be carried out in such a way that minimize impact on the trees and environment. \u201cInstead of cutting the trees, they can be replanted to nearby place. While thousands of trees are felled to give way for projects, its impact is on ecology and environment should be studied,\u201d he said adding that already over 40 trees have been cut in Kalavasal-Guru Theatre strech alone. Adhis Che, an environmental activist, said that while crores of rupees are spent for projects, a few lakh rupees should be set aside for minimising environmental impact. \u201cA city ideally should have 35% of tree cover, but the city like Madurai has far less tree cover. While we are already reeling under heat wave, things will worsen if the trees are felled,\u201d he said. Divisional engineer of state highways, Sivaganga, M Mohanagandhi (in-charge Madurai division), said that no tree is directly affected by the project.

A state transport corporation (TNSTC) official said that the sudden surge was down to the India-Pakistan match that ended shortly before midnight as many waited for the match to end to start off their journey. \u201cThere was a sudden rush after the India\u2013Pakistan World Cup match ended shortly before midnight. We tried our best to manage by operating additional buses,\u201d said a TNSTC official in response to the heavy rush at the Arapalayam bus stand. Return of a large number of college students from the southern districts to colleges in the Coimbatore and Salem regions for the reopening of academic year added to the situation. Besides, who were lucky to get consecutive auspicious days for weddings, were going back to wort on the day.

The woman, who was heading for Coimbatore with two children, said that there was only one government bus to Tirupur around 1 am and no buses to Coimbatore at that time. \u201cThe bus to Tirupur was overcrowded and we could not get into it with the children and luggage,\u201d said the woman. Due to the rush, many omni buses (long distance private buses) did not enter the city on Sunday night and in the early hours of Monday. These buses used to charge Rs 250 for a semi-sleeper and Rs 350 for an AC sleeper berth to Coimbatore. On Sunday, passengers without any other option had to pay Rs 400 for a seater in an ordinary private bus to Coimbatore. There were at least 10 such private buses waiting at that time. \u201cWe have to return without passengers. Hence, we are charging Rs 400,\u201d said one of the operators.

In a statement, the MDMK chief alleged lack of transparency in the admissions, adding a probe should be carried out into the \u201cirregularity\u201d. The admission process for postgraduate courses was carried out in three phases this year: while in the first phase it was for courses which didn\u2019t require any entrance examination, the second was for courses for which admission was done based on the state-level entrance test and the third was for those for which national-level entrance was held. According to Vaiko, when it came to the entrance examinations, the results were never declared and even for the admission procedure, the ranking or merit list was not disclosed in proper manner. Further, he claimed that for counselling, which was held on May 13, the communication for the candidates was sent only by May 10 that too via post and as one of the two days in between was a holiday (Sunday), the information didn\u2019t reach the candidates on time. \u201cThe communication didn\u2019t even reach many and hence only a few students participated in the counselling on Monday,\u201d he added. Vaiko went on to allege that to hide the \u201cmistakes\u201d and \u201cirregularities\u201d, MKU suddenly removed all the admission related announcements and details from the website. He urged that the government should take \u201caction against those who were responsible for the irregularities\u201d However, MKU administration on the other hand dismissed all the allegations. It may be recalled that it was only this year, MKU opted for counselling process for admissions and the university vice-chancellor (VC) M Krishnan said that it was introduced only to make the procedure \u201cmore transparent\u201d. He added that the transparency was in fact praised by the parents of the candidates this year. \u201cWe had not released the merit list online, but on the day of counselling, for all subjects, it was displayed for all the participants in the large screen at our auditorium. When it comes to issuing the results of entrance test, it is not required because we give the merit list. Everything was done as per procedure,\u201d Krishnan said.

In a pre-budget memorandum to the minister, the chamber\u2019s senior president S Rethinavelu and president N Jegatheesan stated that doing away with the 28 per cent tax slab and reducing the tax rates in the other categories would result in better compliance and reflect with increase in tax paid to the government. Lauding the government for reducing GST on various goods from 28% to 18 % at the 28th meeting of the GST Council on July 21, 2018, they pointed out that as many as 28 items including cement and automobile parts are still under the 28 per cent slab. They said that goods that have to be placed under the 12% slab are in the 18% category and this applies to the 12% and 5 % categories as well. The chamber pressed for 18 per cent as highest GST and that it should be applicable only to sin and luxury goods. Suggesting a new Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR) at 15%, they said that the tax slab of existing goods should be reduced to 15%, 12%, 5 % and zero per cent, respectively, from the existing slabs. According to the chamber, all homogenous products should have the same rate to avoid any confusion in the tax rate. \u201cWhat is wrong in fixing the same tax rate on fabric stitched or unstitched? Similarly, there are several items to be simplified. We sincerely hope the FM would rationalize the classification of products under different slab rates,\u201d Rethinavelu said. They sought inclusion of representatives of leading chambers of commerce from all States in the GST Council for enlisting their views and suggestions. They pointed out that businessmen and manufactures are among the main stakeholders in the GST system. They claimed that they are not given an opportunity to directly put forth their suggestions to the GST Council. The chamber stated that dealers are forced to spend much more on GST compliance compared to general sales tax and value added tax. \u201cThe existing system is so complicated that the MSME sector has to spend a monthly consulting fee of Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000 and up to Rs 30,000 annually for the annual return and certification. E-invoice will be a solution to this problem to a great extent,\u201d Rethinavelu said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Unable to repay loan, farmer ends life": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/unable-to-repay-loan-farmer-ends-life/articleshow/69807236.cms", "time": "2019-06-16 11:03:00", "description": "A 56-year-old farmer from Theni district committed suicide unable to repay an agricultural loan that he had taken from a private bank a couple of years ago.

I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week.

Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah.

BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

Chances are that your leg will get caught in a deep gaping hole on the one-kilometre stretch. The stretch of the 80 feet road on Anna Nagar main road, from Ambiga theatre to Golcha complex, has a pavement bordering the road continuously except at places where the streets intercept. The elevated pavement has been laid over a drainage. Morning walkers are seen walking along this stretch, but they prefer to walk on the road as the pavement is not safe. ``Most of the holes in the pavement are visible only during daytime, and anyone falling in could have a serious accident, as there is no foothold below the pavement,\u2019\u2019 said K Thiagarajan of Anna Nagar. This long running pavement is at the entrance of many shops that have started dotting the area, many of them large shops, banks, bank ATMs, eateries, fruits stalls, grocery shops and medical shops. Most of these shops have used boards to close the holes in front of their shops, which makes them more dangerous. ``We did make some representations about two years ago, but nothing was done,\u2019\u2019 said Kumar, a shopkeeper. In places like the bus stop at Suguna store, the holes are big and can result in a person falling into it if the stone kept temporarily gets damaged or breaks, say these shopkeepers. Shanthi, who takes a bus regularly from the Suguna store bus stop, says she does not remember the last time she walked on the pavement. ``Sometimes when I see the bus and must run for it, chances are that I would fall into these holes. So I prefer to run on the middle of the road and stop it,\u2019\u2019 she said. The area is one that has become famous for window shopping, but the shoppers prefer to walk on the road and see the shops rather than on the platform due to its bad condition. ``It would benefit the shops if the people had closer access to the showcases, but the pavement situation makes it impossible,\u2019\u2019 said Krishna, a shopkeeper. City Engineer S Arasu said that the pavements would be surveyed and repaired after preparing an estimate at the earliest.
