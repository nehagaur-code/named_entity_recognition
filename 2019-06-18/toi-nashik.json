The businessmen have asked the police to step up vigil to prevent any such incidents in future. On Friday, six armed robbers entered the office of the Muthoot Finance and shot dead an IT engineer of the company, Sanju Samuel, when he tried to stop them from thrashing the branch manager for not handing over the keys of the strong room. \"The incident is an indication about the rising confidence of criminals to strike even in broad daylight. There are thousands of businessmen who deal with huge amount of cash on daily basis and after Friday's incident they have become fearful,\" a city-based businessman said. According to him, police need to act swiftly to instill confidence among traders and businessmen. \"There have been some incidents related to shop break-ins that are yet to be resolved. We feel that policing in the city has to be more impactful that would deter the goons from carrying out such activities,\" he said. The president of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MACCIA), Santosh Mandlecha, confessed that the city businessmen have become fearful after that incident. \"Our request to the police is take corrective measures immediately. We have an efficient police chief and the need of the hour is to identity the criminals and take strict action against them,\" he said. Gorakh Chaudhary, president of the Nashik Druggist and Chemist Association, said Friday's incident has raised question over the quality of policing in the city. \"I feel that the city police should put in more efforts to ensure that the city is safe. Unless they send a strong message to the criminals, such incidents would continue to take place,\" he said. Meanwhile, police commissioner Vishwas Nagare Patil assured the businessmen that they would go all out to ensure that Nashik is a safe city. \"The incident that took place on Friday is a rare one. Our investigation so far has revealed that an organised syndicate of criminals was behind it. We have already initiated several steps to prevent such incidents,\" he said. According to Nagare Patil, from Saturday five beat marshals and two vehicles have been provided to each of the 13 police stations across the city. \"These beat marshals have been directed to undertake patrolling round-the-clock. And senior police officers will have to monitor the movement of the beat marshals several times on a daily basis,\" the police chief added.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "NAB gives 160 PlexTalk units to students taking higher education": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nab-gives-160-plextalk-units-to-students-taking-higher-education/articleshow/69736993.cms", "time": "2019-06-11 12:32:00", "description": "NASHIK: The Maharashtra unit of National Association for the Blind (NAB) had made 160 PlexTalk machines available to deserving children across the state.

Fadnavis chaired a meeting on Wednesday regarding measures to be taken to improve water supply in Manmad town, the third-largest urban pocket in Nashik district. The town, which is also a key railway junction, has been getting tap water every 21 days. The meeting was attended by water resources minister Girish Mahajan, minister of state for water resources Vijay Shivtare, chief officer of Manmad Municipal Council Dilip Menkar, Dindori BJP MP Bharti Pawar and NCP MLA Pankaj Bhujbal. The twitter handle of the chief minister's office tweeted \"CM approved extended water supply scheme for Manmad.\" Menkar told TOI that under the project, an 80-km pipeline will bring water from the British-era Karanjavan dam in Dindori taluka to the proposed water treatment plant at Manmad. Overhead water tanks would be set up in various locations of the town for distribution to different localities of the town. It would take three years for the state government to complete the project. \"The dam has huge capacity and even the dead stock of the dam would enable us to ensure proper water supply to Manmad for two years. We would lift the water from the dam using solar power,\" added Menkar. A part of the fund would also be used to overhaul the existing water supply infrastructure in the town to prevent water leakages. Local civic officials said this project would help 1.30 lakh people residing in the town during summer. This year, the situation became so grim that the supply was initially restricted to once in 18 days and later once a month. The Waghdardi dam, from which the civic body draws water, had completely dried up in late May. The civic body was unable to provide water to residents. Nashik district administration had directed the civic body to immediately press tankers into service to provide water to the township. Things improved after water was released from the Palkhed dam early this month. The Save Manmad Action Committee (SMAC) had filed in PIL in Bombay high court about the water crisis that the residents have to face every year during summer. The state government later formed a panel to study the issue at Manmad. The outfit has expressed happiness over the approval for the project. \"Our organisation has been fighting for seven years to improve the water supply system in the town. It has now borne fruit. We hope that the project sees the light of the day within the time frame set by the state government,\" said Rekha Yenare, a senior member of the outfit.

Proposed features of the smart road includes uniform standard carriage way from one junction to another, proper designed footpaths, bicycle lane, road intersection development, infrastructure utility ducts below footpaths, road marking, proper storm water drainage and landscaping to increase overall aesthetics of the road.

Even the chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had called a meeting to discuss measures to improve the water situation here. Geologist Suresh Khanapurkar, a former officer with the Groundwater Survey and Development Agency (GSDA), has suggested a water conservation plan for the Manmad town to the Nashik district administration. Khanapurkar is credited with the Shirpur-pattern of water conservation in Dhule district. \"The plan is to deepen and widen nullahs in the Wanjarwadi and Satvai watershed areas. They will carry rainwater from the respective watershed areas into the Panjhan river. Thereafter, a weir can be constructed to pick up water for supply to the town,\" Khanapurkar said. This entire plan will cost Rs70 crore and provide space to store water and encourage its seepage. Stressing on recharging underground aquifers, as done in Dhule, Khanapurkar said deepening and widening of the nullahs would go a long way in water conservation. \"There is already a Rs290-crore scheme proposed for Manmad.

Earlier, the daily arrivals at Lasalgaon amounted to around 15,000 quintals. This has now reduced to around 10,000 quintals a day as farmers are busy preparing for the kharif season,\" APMC officials said. They added the price improvement has brought smiles to the faces of onion growers. Officials at the APMC added the prices are expected to touch Rs1,500 per quintal in a couple of weeks as the fasting month of Ramzan is over and demand has started to increase again. The average wholesale price of Rs 1,250 per quintal on Monday was a marginal increase from Friday's Rs1,200 per quintal. The minimum and maximum prices were Rs 600 and Rs1,401 per quintal, respectively. The farmers who need money for kharif sowing are bringing their produce to the market and their produce is fetching good rates, sources said. Farmers prefer storing the good quality summer onions in the hope of getting better prices later. The prices started increasing last month after the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed) started onion procurement from the district. In the past one month, the average wholesale price has increased by Rs400 per quintal.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Unfortunately, Samuel lost his own life when the robbers, angry with him for taking them on, pumped three bullets into him at point blank range. Samuel, who originally hails from Kerala, was currently residing in the Nerul area of Navi Mumbai with his wife and ten-month-old son. His widowed mother stays at his native place in Kerala. Nashik police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil told TOI, \"We have detained two persons in connection with the incident. We have CCTV footage in which the faces of the goons are clearly visible. Such a crime could not have happened without local support. We will crack the case soon.\" The robbers came on three motorcycles to the commercial complex which houses the finance company's office. Brandishing revolvers, they barged into the first floor office around 11.30am and forced seven employees and a few customers, including women, into a corner. When they saw Samuel and the auditor, Kailash Jayan (25), in a room in the back office, they dragged them out. However, before that, Samuel displayed presence of mind to press the burglar alarm. Samuel managed to free himself from the clutches of the robbers and rushed to help branch manager Chandrashekhar Deshpande (64), who was being repeatedly hit on the head with the butt of a revolver. The robbers were demanding that Deshpande hand over the keys of the strong room where cash and gold were kept. Deputy commissioner of police Amol Tambe told TOI, \"Samuel took on the goons who were thrashing Deshpande and started pushing them back. However, one of them fired three rounds at him in the chest and he collapsed on the floor. As Samuel lay in a pool of blood, the robbers panicked and fled the office immediately without taking any cash or gold.\" Techie resists armed robbers at finance co\u2019s office, shot deadSamuel was immediately rushed to the Nashik Civil Hospital where he was pronounced dead by the doctors. His relatives arrived from Nerul and took his body after the post mortem. According to the police, Samuel was in Nashik for the last couple of days, working to strengthen the IT system at the office. Nangare-Patil described Samuel as a strong person. \"Eyewitnesses told us he alone retaliated when the robbers were thrashing Deshpande. It's sad that he lost his life in such a tragic manner,\" he said. Police officials, quoting some eyewitnesses, said the robbers spoke in Marathi. \"We suspect they must have done a recce of the entire area before making this attempt to rob cash and gold from the office,\" they said. After the incident, the entire area around the commercial complex was cordoned off and sniffer dogs were pressed into service. There was traffic chaos in the area as vehicular movement on the busy road was stopped for over an hour. In a statement, R M Diwan, senior general manager of Muthoot Finance Ltd, said the operations at the branch would be temporarily suspended. \"We are extending full co-operation to the investigating agencies and the police in the case. We will go the extra mile to extend necessary support to all the affected persons, including our staff, while protecting the customers' valuables. We are putting best efforts to ensure that such incidents do not arise in the future,\" he added.

During his recent visit to Nashik, Anbalagan said that MIDC is already in talks with some large industries to make investment and soon more investment will follow the route. \u201cEarlier, industries had to go for expansion in industrial estate where they have their existing plants. But we relaxed this norms and they may obtain land from MIDC in any industrial estate in the district or elsewhere,\u201d said Anbalagan. Both Satpur and Abamd industrial estates are fully occupied and there is no land available for existing industries for expansion. Hence, they have opportunities to go for expansion at the new industrial estate coming up at Talegaon-Akrale near Nashik city, he said. Anbalagan mentioned that the MIDC is in process of acquiring land at various locations for the industries in the district. \u201cWe are acquiring land for industries in Sinnar and also at Rajur Bahula near Nashik city,\u201d he said. MIDC has proposed 337 hectares at Talegaon-Akrale. Of which, over 200 hectares have been acquired with infrastructure works like roads, streetlights and water supply have been developed there.

Going by police records, the maximum number of house break-ins occur at night. This year, from January 1 to April 30, police registered 63 house break-ins during the night hours against six during the day time. The situation was same last year during the same period, with 67 house break-ins at night against 17 in the day time. Careless security personnel is one of the reasons for house break-ins and theftduring night. Senior officials said every day during night hours, a call is given to the police personnel on night duty to check security guards and watchmen from 2am to 5am. This is the time when most of the guards are found napping. DCP Amol Tambe said, \u201cAlert security guards would definitely help in bringing down burglaries in the night. There are a large number of watchmen and security guards in various lanes and bylanes of the city. However most of them are found sleeping.\u201d \u201cWe not only woke the security guards up but also click photos of them and sent it to their employers. On one occasion, we found all the three security guards at a jewellery store in Nashik Road fast asleep. After the photos of the napping security guards were sent to their employer, he installed a thumb impression machine and asked the guards to put their thumb impression every 10 minutes during their duty,\u201d said Tambe. Tambe said some security agencies ensure that their personnel do their duty sincerely. Such security guards are also given good salaries. However, certain housing societies and commercial establishments employ watchmen at meagre salaries. These are the ones who do some other work in the day time and the duty of watchmen at night, when they fall asleep. This is not solving the purpose for which the guards or watchmen are employed. In the backdrop of the rising number of burglaries and theft, police have asked residential societies and traders to install CCTVs at societies and shops that would help police in cracking cases. Most of the security guards who are found sleeping are those deployed at ATMs, banks, financial institutions and commercial complexes as the concerned security personnel are well aware that no one comes to such places during the night.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

Commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare Patil expressed concern while reviewing the deaths due to the presence of trees on the roads. He has sent a letter to municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game on Wednesday, requesting him to come up with some kind of solution so that precious lives are not lost. \"These fully grown trees have virtually become a death trap for motorists at night. Although reflectors have been put on the tree trunks, it is serving no purpose as the mishaps and death toll indicate,\" said traffic police officials. In the latest incident in the wee hours of Wednesday, Vishnu Pol, a 29-year-old police constable who was returning home from duty, failed to notice a huge tree on the Gangapur Road and dashed against it. \"Pol is in coma and battling for life in the ICU at a city hospital as he sustained grave injuries.

The civic body must find a solution to the issue,\" police officers said. Nangare Patil said that he expects the civic body to take measures on the issue to prevent mishaps and deaths related to trees on roads. Nangare Patil's predecessor, Ravinder Singal, too had taken up this issue during a meeting with the Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd officials. He had requested them to deal with the issue seriously as it was claiming lives of motorists. When contacted, NMC officials said, \"We have decided to encircle the trees on roads with old tyres and sacks filled with soil so that the impact of the mishap would come down if a vehicle hits it. We shall also put proper reflectors on the tyres and sacks so that it is visible at night from a distance.\" In the long term, the civic body would apprise the high court about the findings of the city police related to mishaps and deaths caused due to the trees on roads. \"A case related to felling of trees on road is being heard by the high court, which has directed us not to cut trees of rare species.

Police were informed and a team of divers from the disaster management group joined the rescue operation,\" said DC (Port) Syed Waquar Raza.

Hence, we allowed him permission,\" Raza said. The letter added that he wanted to take photographs and perform an extra event around 1.30pm. The final dip made by Chanchal Lahiri\"He performed almost an hour earlier. Hence, river traffic police was absent,\" said a Port division officer. Police said Lahiri drowned around 12.30pm and it is unclear whether he was performing or practising the act. Moments before the stunt on Sunday, Lahiri said, \"If you perform a dangerous trick perfectly, you are a magician. If you fail, it is always tragic.\" Mandrake's body was fished out on Monday\"Bound and chained, Mandrake was lowered 30 feet under water. Thousands watched and it is impossible the cops missed the entire episode when even politicians were present,\" claimed a friend on Monday. In 2013, when Lahiri performed the same stunt, he was assaulted by the crowd of onlookers, who claimed they felt cheated because they had seen through the trick.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Nashik: Man booked for sending obscene messages": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-man-booked-for-sending-obscene-messages/articleshow/69798158.cms", "time": "2019-06-15 11:01:00", "description": "NASHIK: An unidentified person has been booked by police for sending obscene messages on social media to a group of women in the city.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister said an active and effective opposition is a necessity in a democracy and pointed out that a well- argued and factual criticism of the government strengthens democracy. \"Sometimes such positive contributions are not noticed as they do not get high TRPs,\" he said. Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

After the drop in the revenue generated through property tax, the municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game has directed the concerned department to start action against defaulters. In the first phase, defaulters with dues of above Rs 50,000 are to be targeted. NMC has shortlisted 3,564 defaulters having dues over Rs 50,000.They altogether have property tax dues amounting to Rs 98.22 crore. The civic body will send final notices to the defaulters asking them to pay the dues. If they fail to do so, the NMC will send them warrants to auction their properties, NMC sources said.

The NMC had set a property tax collection target of Rs 250 crore during the last fiscal, considering the addition of new tax payers. The civic body had decided to bring 59,000 new properties across the city under the tax net during the last fiscal; however, it had deferred its decision following objections by the new property owners about the inflated bills and wrong calculations of property tax.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

The deceased has been identified as Sushil Pravin Gaikwad, a resident of Mathura Road, Vihitgaon. The police said the two suspects arrested in the murder case are Hamid Rashid Shaikh (21) and Sonu Swami (20), both residents of the Samata Nagar area. They were produced before a city court on Friday, which remanded them in police custody till June 10. The police said that Gaikwad operated the autorickshaw of Hamid Rashid Shaikh (21) on a rental basis. He also worked with a food catering firm and took Hamid's auto only when the firm did not have any order. On May 30, Gaikwad was operating the auto as usual on the stretch between Bytco, Deolali Camp and Bhagur, when he was caught by traffic constables during their routine drive against erring motorists. Since Gaikwad was not carrying the auto's documents and did not have enough money to pay the fine, the auto was seized by the cops. Gaikwad was told by the police to pay the fine in the court and then take back the auto. The Upnagar police said that Gaikwad had also informed the same to Hamid. He was also adamant that he would not pay the fine amount as he was not responsible for the incomplete documents. Meanwhile, Hamid got the autorickshaw back from the police by paying the fine. On June 5, when Sushil was taking a walk near his residence, Hamid Shaikh and Sonu Swami met him and asked him to forget the past incident. They later made him sit in the auto and took him to an open plot in Rahul Nagar. The three, however, started quarrelling about the police action and the fine. The verbal spat soon turned physical and the duo pushed him into a nearby well. People who were watching the brawl from a distance immediately rushed to the well when they saw Gaikwad falling into it, said senior PI of Upnagar police station, Bharat Kumar Suryawanshi. While the duo escaped from the scene, the residents of Rahul Nagar informed the fire brigade, after which a rescue team rushed the to the spot and fished Gaikwad out. He had died of drowning by the time he was taken out of the well. The case is being investigated further, said Suryawanshi.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.
