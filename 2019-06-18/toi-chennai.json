At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Arjun Kapoor": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/arjun-kapoor-impresses-rumoured-girlfriend-malaika-arora-once-again/videoshow/69835240.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "St Thomas Mount metro station toilets locked \u2018due to non-availability of water\u2019": {"description": "CHENNAI: Commuters who walked in to St Thomas Mount metro station on Monday noon were shocked to find the toilets closed and barricaded due to shortage of water.

Or the night temperature suddenly dips when you near Gandhi Mandapam from Little Mount? Well, the team at Centre for Climate Change and Adaptation Research, Anna University, which studied the thermal comfort level in Chennai has an answer. Researchers said western and southwestern parts of the city show higher discomfort and the most obvious reason for this is rapid urbanisation without providing for any green cover. With very few trees, these concrete jungles have become heat islands. While studying variations of temperature indicative of urban heat islands, the team noticed maximum intensity of temperature in central and north Chennai. These are distinguished commercial centres and also densely populated residential areas. Extended areas such as Avadi, Poonamalee in the west and Tambaram, Medavakkam in the southwest record higher temperatures due to unplanned urbanisation, researchers said citing that concrete tends to retain the sun\u2019s heat. The result of this will be extended summers and excessive rainfall in future climate scenarios, the researchers said. \u201cHeat island is a product of urban climate. Cities in tropical countries suffer extensively due to the urban heat island effect and urban climate studies are necessary to improve the comfort level and city planning,\u201d said Anushiya, a member of the research team.

While its lone MP in the LS and 13 members in RS will raise concerns of the state and move amendments, it will not stand in the way of passage of crucial bills in both Houses, sources said. The controversial clauses of the bills were taken up by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami in his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, seeking his intervention. \u201cThere will not be any confrontation with the Centre nor any opposition to the bills. We will continue to raise the concerns of the state as they (Centre) are concerned about the entire nation. The amendments will be moved by the MPs as per instructions from the high command,\u201d said a senior AIADMK leader. While the dam safety bill was introduced in LS in December last year, the motor vehicles amendments bill was passed in April and both lapsed with the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha. The Tamil Nadu assembly had passed an unanimous resolution in June last year not to enact a law on dam safety until the states were consulted and consensus was evolved. The main concern of the state was that the bill envisages a national dam safety authority that would act as state dam safety organization for a dam located in one state and owned by another. It would only mean that the state owning the dam would have no rights over the safety and maintenance of the dam located in another state. Mullaperiyar, Parambikulam, Thunakadavu and Peruvaripallam dams are owned, operated and maintained by Tamil Nadu by inter-state agreements, but located in Kerala. With 37 MPs, the AIADMK, as the third largest party in Parliament, had raised strong objections when the bills were introduced last year. \u201cThis time, the AIADMK will only object to eroding the rights of Tamil Nadu, which is a violation of the federal principles, and seek amendments to the clauses,\u201d said a senior minister. While the Centre aims at reforming the transport sector with the proposed amendments to Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the Tamil Nadu government demands that the Centre modifies five clauses, which even overruns the nationalisation policy of the state. A clause eliminates the monopoly of the states to carry on transport business and feared to weaken or even terminate the service of state transport undertakings.

A classic example is the 2015 floods and the water paucity a year-and-a-half later. Flood water from Adyar river entered homes, caused extensive damage, and a large quantum of it drained into the sea under the watchful eyes of the city planners. Chennai has been banking on three water reservoirs for the past 100 years, with the government not setting up a new reservoir that could at least store Krishna water from Andhra Pradesh or collect rainwater in the city suburbs. In the past 30 years no proper step has been taken to increase the city\u2019s water capacity despite its growing population. At one point of time, the DMK government considered establishing two reservoirs to store Krishna water but dropped the plan. Instead, Krishna water was taken to the existing Poondi reservoir. The AIADMK government too failed to create an additional reservoir though Rs500 crore was sanctioned in 2012. Had these plans been implemented, the city probably would not have suffered massive damage due to the floods in 2015, and saved part of the water too. In 2017, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in the Performance Audit of Flood Management and Response in Chennai and its Suburban Area highlighted several failures on the part of the Tamil Nadu government which led to the \"manmade disaster\". The CAG report noted, \"Considering the catastrophic floods in 1976, TN constituted a nucleus cell to suggest flood mitigation measures.\" Creation of two reservoirs in the upstream of Chembarambakkam tank on Adyar river to capture 1.57 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) of water was recommended in 1980. \"We noticed that after a delay of seven years, water resources department (WRD) in 1987 proposed a reservoir at Thiruneermalai, by which time the site had become populated and requisite land was not available. Thus, the WRD failed to construct the reservoir which could have accommodated the surplus water in Adyar river in 2015. Instead of creating new reservoirs upstream Chembarambakkam tank, TN envisaged three tanks across the Kosasthalayar river to augment storage by 4.2tmcft.\" These three projects proved to be disappointments, the report said, pointing out that against an outlay of Rs500.36 crore to increase the storage capacity by 1.83tmcft, an expenditure of Rs289.63 crore was incurred until the end of March 2016 to achieve an increase of only 0.17tmcft. The state has now announced that a new reservoir would be built, combining the Orathur, Arambakkam tanks and Orathur check dam in Sriperumbudur taluk, with a capacity of 1.3tmcft at a cost of Rs60 crore by 2021, even while the proposed new reservoir at Thervaikandigai (Rs330 crore) is under construction. The Thervaikandigai proposal has suffered due to faulty land acquisition resulting in enormous delay, according to the CAG report. In 2011-12, TN also envisaged construction of a reservoir at Thirukandalam in Tiruvallur district across Kosasthalayar river to store 1tmcft of water downstream of Poondi reservoir and Thamaraipakkam Anicut. As the proposal required acquisition of private land across 1,376.52 hectare, on government orders, WRD downsized the project to construct a check dam to store 0.16tmcft. The structure was designed to withstand a maximum flood discharge of 65,000 cusec, but the WRD failed to take into account the discharge of 92,260 cusec at Poondi reservoir in 1966. The work was completed in September 2014 at a cost of Rs28.65 crore. During the floods in 2015, the retaining wall of the check dam breached due to inflow of 79,564 cusec. The CAG report observed that the imprudent decision of TN to reduce the storage capacity to avoid land acquisition resulted in failure to harness excess water. \"Incorrect adoption of flood discharge capacity for construction of the check dam resulted in its breach during 2015 floods thereby causing inundation of nearby areas,\" the report stated. Further, TN did not consider construction of check dams at Varadharajapuram and Anakaputhur villages to harness surplus floodwater of Adyar river despite it being recommended by the expert committee on northeast monsoon. On the contrary, it allowed the Airports Authority of India to demolish a check dam across the Adyar. Construction of the suggested check dams, could, to an extent, have reduced the flow of flood water. Encroachment of tanks, lakes and river beds also played a major role in causing the massive floods in Chennai and the present scarcity. Large-scale illegal constructions and lack of implementation of rainwater harvesting systems contributed to the present crisis. Thousands of waterbodies in Greater Chennai region are crying for attention, which are cost-effective water sources for the parched city. The solution lies within. The question is will there be an end to the dearth of ideas.

Moving from the regular practice of paying the tankers after delivery, we offered them advances, still the tankers were unable to supply forcing the hostels to shut down,\u201d said Tamil Nadu Hostel Owners Welfare Association founder president Shobana Madhavan. After private tankers, distribution of bubble top cans too has become an issue.

There are around 2,000 working women\u2019s hostels in Chennai and its suburbs. Working women from other districts and states depend on these facilities.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad.

The woman, identified as Dhanabakiyam, was waiting to buy her monthly provisions, when she was pushed to the ground. Police said the stampede occurred when the crowd of ration card holders, mostly women, surged forward. Dhanabakiyam, who was caught in the stampede, was found lying unconscious. As confusion prevailed, a few villagers managed to pull Dhanabakiyam, trapped under the crowd of women, out and carry her to a nearby house. They tried to revive her by sprinkling water on her face. They then took her to the Government Tiruvannamalai Medical College and Hospital where she was declared dead. The Tiruvannamalai taluk police registered a case. The incident occurred around 9 am when the outlet salesman R Krishnan asked the women to stand in a queue to receive the supplies and went inside to prepare the tokens. Some of the women, who tried to move forward, broke the line, falling on Dhanabakiyam. When contacted, Tiruvannamalai district collector K S Kandasamy said, \u201cAccording to officials, there is very little possibility of the woman having died in a stampede. A team of civil supplies officials is, however, conducting a probe,\u201d the collector told TOI. He denied villagers\u2019 allegation that the shop was opened only twice a month. Tiruvannamalai taluk supply officer K Sumathi, heading the probe, also denied that the PDS outlet was opened only twice a month. She said 200 ration card holders had queued up before the shop when the woman was found unconscious. \u201cBut, the salesman Krishnan was not aware of how the woman died until an ambulance reached the spot to take her to the hospital. He was busy preparing the tokens to be distributed,\u201d she said. \u201cPreliminary enquiries revealed that the woman had skipped her breakfast. She fell unconscious while standing in the queue,\u201d the officer said. Villagers, however, maintained that the utlet was opened to them only twice a month due to gross shortage of supplies. Former village councilor P Karunanidhi said though the outlet catered to more than 900 ration card holders from three villages in the neighbourhood, including Inamkariyandhal, S Mottur and Varattakuttai, due to shortage of supplies of the essential commodities, it was opened only twice a month. Vijayalakshmi, a villager, added it was due to the laxity of the salesman Krishnan, that the ration shop was opened just twice a month. \u201cOfficials should take steps to open the outlet every day, or they should open more PDS outlets in each village to avert such tragedies,\u201d she said.

The rank list, which was to be released on Monday, will be released today, i.e. June 20 and counselling for special category candidates \u2014 people with disabilities and eminent sports persons \u2014 will begin on June 25, according to an official release. READ ALSO: TNEA 2019 Rank List to be out shortly @ tneaonline.in\u201cEvery day of delay is advantageous to deemed universities and top private colleges. Students, with a cut-off (minimum eligibility score) of 180 and above are uncertain of getting admissions in sought-after colleges through counselling. They are confused whether to join private institutions or wait for the counselling to begin,\u201d said education consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi. Corroborating this, deemed universities, in their official press releases, claim to have witnessed a spike in applicants and cut-off scores based on which admission is carried out alongside entrance tests. This could be an indicator that toppers who could have secured admission through counselling may have joined deemed universities due to the delay. As far as top private engineering colleges affiliated to Anna University are concerned, there has been an increase in demand for integrated courses like MSc Data Sciences, business analytics and artificial intelligence, Gandhi added. Deadline to pay fees for these courses (under management quota) is nearing and some have opted for these courses, reducing the chance of more toppers joining Anna University colleges further, say experts. The counselling was already set to begin with 40,000 vacant seats as only 1.3 lakh applied for 1.7 lakh seats available. A senior official from Anna University said not conducting counselling as announced will make people lose trust and turn them towards institutions which have better infrastructure and placement record than affiliated colleges. \u201cAfter vice-chancellor M K Surappa withdrew, the committee hasn\u2019t utilised Anna University\u2019s resources and they are feeling the heat now.

But in future this could be true. Researchers at Anna University have found that due to climate change, there would be a 2\u00b0C rise in effective temperature during winter and post monsoon by 2050, making winters uncomfortable. Effective temperature is the combined effect of temperature and relative humidity on the human body and this determines thermal comfort \u2013 a major issue in cities across the world and expected to change in future due to climate change. Thermal comfort is calculated using the temperature humidity index or thermo-hygrometric index (THI). \u201cFor instance, if the temperature is 35\u00b0C in Chennai, the relative humidity makes us feel as if it is above 40\u00b0C,\u201d said K Palanivelu, director, Centre for Climate Change and Adaptation Research, Anna University. Researchers studied this change in THI. Palanivelu and his co-researchers Anushiya Jeganathan and A Ramachandran observed changes in the past 60 years (1951-2010) of daily maximum temperature and relative humidity data of Chennai procured from Indian Meteorological Department to arrive at a projected THI in future. The study was made using a method to project future climate scenarios developed at the centre with the help of UK met office\u2019s PRECIS (Providing Regional Climate for Impact Studies) software. \u201cLong term analysis shows there is a steady increase of discomfort in the city,\u201d said Anushiya Jeganathan, a member of the research team. The researchers said an increase in winter temperatures was noticed in many parts of the world, including Chennai. The changes in comfort level was studied in two phases \u2014 1951-1980 and 1981-2010. The change in discomfort level saw a regular increase in the second phase when compared to the first, according to the research. During 1981-2010, the THI went up in all month except in June, August and September. \u201cA significant increase is noticed in February (1.1\u00b0C) followed by January and March (1\u00b0C) for the period of 1981-2010,\u201d the research said. This has been consistent with the projected data with mid-century (2041-2070) and end century (2071-2099) estimates showing an average rise of 2\u00b0C and 4.6\u00b0C. \u201cThe increase of discomfort level in winter months is distressing,\u201d the research said. Researchers said the current trend puts the onus on urban planners who have to evolve climate-smart strategies. A very obvious measure is increasing green cover, said Palanivelu citing the example of a dip in temperature in and around the IIT-M and Raj Bhavan campus due to the extensive green cover. The researchers said studies across the world have shown an association between high temperatures and heat-related mortality.

Patients, including those visiting from other states, were asked to return on Tuesday if they didn\u2019t have pain or \u201cemergency\u201d needs. Doctors in several hospitals in Chennai, including Apollo Hospitals, SIMS Hospitals, Gleneagles Global and Fortis Malar, trimmed down their appointments and sent text messages and emails to patients with support from hospital managements. Inpatient services, operation theatres (including elective surgeries), lab services and emergency rooms were functioning. Posters announcing reasons for strike and doctors\u2019 demands were displayed in several hospitals. \u201cWe are deeply pained to be forced to indulge in such attacks,\u201d said posters announcing strikes. However, doctors at all government hospitals worked. \"We expressed solidarity with the striking doctors by wearing black badges,\" said Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association president Dr K Senthil. In private hospitals, some physicians took the day off while surgeons postponed consultation including post-operative appointments. As a result, emergency and trauma wards were overcrowded through the day. \u201cI have fever and cough since last night. I need only a consultation, but I had to go to the emergency because I got no appointments. It wasn\u2019t possible to wait for a day,\u201d said 60-year-old Ramesh Kumar S, who retired from government service recently. In another hospital, doctors cancelled appointment given to a seven-year-old child and rescheduled it for Wednesday. \"I took permission from my daughter's school for vaccination today. The revised schedule for me is such as burden because I have to reschedule my work appointments, talk to my daughter's school and coordinate with the autoriskshaw driver,\" said Madhumathi M, who works for a private bank. The strike would continue till 6am on Tuesday in an attempt to draw the government\u2019s attention to doctors\u2019 demands, said IMA state wing president Dr S Kanagasabapathy. \u201cWe have never seen such a big response to strike before,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of anger among doctors because they often come under attack here too. Although Tamil Nadu was one of the first few states to bring legislations that protect doctors and hospitals, conviction rates have been very poor,\u201d he said. Since the Tamil Nadu Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property) Act, 2008 came into force, the state has registered about 33 cases and 13 people have been convicted. \u201cSeveral times, complaints are not even registered. At least 19 states across the country have similar law, but we are now asking for a central Act that will be more stringent,\u201d said IMA former national vice-president Dr TN Ravishankar. Doctors want punishment enhanced to up to 10 years of imprisonment with a fine that is nearly three times the cost of damage to the hospital. \u201cWe need not be paid all the money. Let the additional money go to government coffers, but it will instil some fear,\u201d said Dr Kanagasabapathy. Doctors also want senior policemen, not below the rank of deputy superintendent or assistant commissioner of police, to investigate such attacks.

Police said Lahiri drowned around 12.30pm and it is unclear whether he was performing or practising the act. Moments before the stunt on Sunday, Lahiri said, \"If you perform a dangerous trick perfectly, you are a magician.

All large Shiva temples perform five abhishekams and six times pooja daily, using borewells drilled within a well or a tank and are now being aked to use water sparingly. \u201cWe completely depend on borewells within tanks as well as on temple premises. The six borewells at the Kaplaeeswarar temple in Mylapore are the only source.

Bigger tests, however, await it in selection of candidates for Rajya Sabha polls, the schedule for which could be announced in the next few days. With AIADMK coordinator and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam having promised at the June 12 meeting, to announce the names of the 11-member steering committee in two weeks\u2019 time, that too is yet to draw any attention so far. In the five days since that meeting, both OPS and joint coordinator and chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami were hardly in Chennai, with OPS away in his home town and EPS having had to attend meetings in New Delhi. \u201cThere has been no further discussion, within the party, on any issue after the June 12 meeting, barring a closed door meeting that OPS and EPS had along with party deputy coordinators K P Munusamy and R Vaithilingam soon after that meeting in the AIADMK headquarters. Now that EPS is back in Chennai from New Delhi and OPS expected to return to the city on Monday, things could kickstart,\u201d a senior AIADMK leader, who did not want to be named, told TOI. On Saturday, Election Commission (EC) had announced the schedule for filling six Rajya Sabha seats, which fell vacant, in the states of Bihar, Gujarat and Odisha, with a formal notification to be issued on Tuesday. Soon, the announcement of schedule for filling the six Rajya Sabha seats from Tamil Nadu is expected to be made over next few days. \u201cDespite the differences that continue to exist between them, the two leaders cannot delay deliberations any further.

This is against vigilance and railway guidelines as rotation of shift is a must, especially for employees working in a sensitive area like the parcel office. This pattern was noticed in employees who handled cash at the parcel office as well. TOI has seen a copy of the attendance log for three months. Senior officials told TOI that the roster has been changed since. Informed sources said this was a key point in the modus operandi of the mafia that controls the parcel office. They decide which cargo gets loaded when, bypasses systems to aid under-weighment and takes bribe. TOI had reported how the mafia earns Rs 3 lakh every day in bribes from those who want to load their cargo on to trains. \u201cThe most lucrative time for working as loading clerk is in the morning, when inward parcels from trains from New Delhi and northern states arrive at Chennai. Similarly, the evening shift is lucrative as many perishable and non-perishable goods are loaded on to trains to Hyderabad, Kerala, Kolkata and Howrah,\u201d said a source at the parcel office. Parcel supervisors who are in charge of ensuring rotation of clerks remain spectators, as influential union office-bearers are involved in this, said an official. For instance, the attendance sheets accessed by TOI show overwriting at many spots, where M (morning) is converted into L (leave) or R (rest) is converted into E (evening). In fact many of the employees have written to us that they want to be transferred out of the parcel office as they are unable to work alongside the mafia, said two sources, one an office-bearer of an employees union and another, an official in Chennai division of Southern Railway. Meanwhile, divisional railway manager P Mahesh sent out an internal note on Thursday, stating that every railway employee should carry an identity card on railway premises. \u201cThis came after it was found that unauthorised agents freely roamed the parcel office, claiming to be associated with the railways,\u201d said an official involved in the investigation.

Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022.

Here is another: a new city-based study has found that overweight people lost more teeth than their normal-weight peers. Although surprising, the link isn\u2019t a newly discovered one, and doctors across the world are increasing connecting body mass index to dental health. Dentists researched about 500 people -- both men and women -- aged 40 years and older with missing posterior teeth (not rehabilitated with any prosthesis) through clinical history and intraoral examination for the study called, \u2018Body Mass Index and Tooth Loss: An Epidemiological Study in a Sample of Suburban South Indian Population\u2019. Among the 260 women in the study group, 133 were obese and 35 were overweight. Of the 240 men in the group, 73 were obese and 74 were overweight. The biggest number of high tooth loss in both genders was among those who are obese. At least 55 women in the obese group suffered high tooth loss compared to 27 men in the same group. \u201cThere is no known mechanism that explains the exact relationship between obesity, tooth loss, and gender differences. It has been speculated that these changes are mediated by eating behaviour of the individual,\u201d said the corresponding author Dr Parthasarathy Natarajan, department of prosthodontics, at Faculty of Dental Sciences, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research. The results, published in the Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences allowed the authors to conclude that BMI and tooth loss are interrelated. Further analysis showed 70% of obese women were from the low socioeconomic group, which is significantly higher than any other group. The authors say the study has a limitation as the medical diseases are only self-reported and they have not done an assessment of physical activity, food preferences of the individuals, and level of education was performed. \u201cA case-control study with more samples may give us better conclusive evidence,\u201d they said. But studies done abroad that took account factors such as blood sugar levels, smoking, and eating and exercise habits, with age and gender also showed a significant link between obesity and dental health. Doctors say obesity contributes to inflammation in the body, which has long been associated with gum disease. \u201cDiseases of the mouth have long been associated with cardiac diseases and some cancers. The mouth is generally a gateway to good health, a reason why most general physicians look into your mouth during the examination,\u201d said diabetologist Dr V Mohan.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Their family had taken Rs 40,000 as an advance in 2017 and put the boys in bondage. Acting on a tip-off from International Justice Mission (IJM), revenue divisional officer of Ponneri, Nandakumar, along with his subordinates and police raided a house and orchard owned by a man namedPanneer atAppavaram on Saturday evening. After searching for more than an hour, they found the boys behind bushes around 500m from Panneer\u2019s house where they were held hostage. On seeing the team, Panneer and his brother Patha fled the village to avoid arrest. Officials said the boys took care of a herd of 40 cows, kept a watch on the orchard and worked as farm hands. \u201cFrom grazing the cattle to cleaning their shed to guarding the orchard, the boys toiled from early morning to late evening. They worked for more than 10 hours a day and were given only two meals,\u201d said Raja, an advocate who assisted officials in the rescue operation. Panneer and his brother used to beat them up, he said. Recalling the summer of 2017, Lalitha, a native of Nelvoyal, said her sons were studying in Class IV and V at a government school in the neighbouring village when Panneer andhisbrother approached her.

The desperate measures were taken in the light of water supply by tankers being hit due to depleting water resources in Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts.

Tapan Agarwal, director of a chain of restaurants, said one of their branches in Velachery had to discontinue services during lunch for two days. \u201cTen days ago, our regular supplier failed to deliver and repeated attempts to source water also turned a futile exercise because of the prevailing water crisis.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Everything new about him, say a new haircut or ear piercings, was seen with suspicion, given his history of peddling ganja through his teens. The scenario has, however, changed now, with police going out of their way to get Kalaiselvan a job as a construction worker earning not less than Rs 8,000 a month. Inspector Rajeshwari of Secretariat Colony police station says Kalaiselvan has promised to turn over a new leaf. \u201cHe is a skilled worker who slogs all seven days a week and supports his family financially,\u201d she adds. Kalaiselvan is one of the more than 30 former ganja peddlers from the locality, who Rajeshwari helped shed their criminal pasts and take up jobs in the past three months. Some run small stalls selling idli, tea and groceries, while the rest are employed in hotels as house keeping staff and bill collectors. Most of the former peddlers are victims of broken families who were brought up by grandparents and roamed the streets freely, she says. \u201cThey become easy targets for established peddlers who use minors as delivery boys since juveniles can get away easily,\u201d she said. The idea of rehabilitating them struck the inspector when she was questioning one such teenager, she says. \u201cMost of the peddlers were caught as juveniles. Every time I ask them why they do it, they cited poverty,\u201d says Rajeshwari. \u201cSo I hoped that if I found them a job, their problems will be sorted out and they will stay away from peddling and chasing money. Personally, I believe sending them to juvenile homes or jails will not help much unless their basic needs are met,\u201d she says. Rajeshwari borrowed used clothes from friends and distributed them to the reformed peddlers. She bought utensils for the women who have set up food kiosks.

Hence we called the meeting and have assured them of all help from the government. However, the IT companies have denied having asked employees to work from home,\u201d Babu told TOI. Residents remain the government\u2019s top priority but business establishments will not be overlooked. \u201cWe will not leave IT companies and others in the lurch. We are coordinating with Metrowater to see possible ways of helping them. For instance, Metrowater has \u2018grey water\u2019 which can be supplied to the companies for flushing purposes,\u201d he said. But two independent sources confirmed TOI that work from home has been exercised by some companies on OMR. \u201cOne IT major near Siruseri has informed employees to execute the \u2018work from home\u2019 option as per their convenience. Nothing has been communicated officially. It is informal,\u201d a consultant with the IT major said. Vasumathi R, president of Forum for IT/ITES Employees, said, \u201cIt was informal. In fact, start-ups on OMR are the worst hit.\u201d TOI sent two mails to NASSCOM in the past one week seeking its response regarding the water crisis and its impact on IT companies on OMR. But it is yet to reply. While the government does not want to accept that there is a crisis, some companies have asked employees who are part of support functions to work from home. \u201cThis is a natural disaster. As there is a phenomenal demand from residents, the pressure is on IT companies. It is forcing them to take a fresh look at their water management policy, including use of recycled water and judicious use of available water,\u201d a source from the industry said. \u201cThere is a problem and we are trying to reduce water consumption. Wherever sewage treatment plants are available, recycled water is made available for use. For others, it is a big challenge,\u201d says Ajit Chordia, managing director, Olympia Tech Park. \u201cWhile treatment plants have come in handy, we are working together with companies and their employees on an optimal consumption approach and cautiously reducing water usage and its wastage. We are sourcing only that much of water that is required and nothing more,\u201d said C Velan, city head, Chennai operations, Ascendas. Most of the IT companies on OMR have long-term contracts with water suppliers, said T Raghunandana, managing director, UDS, a facility management company. \u201cWhile tanker companies end up servicing only the larger firms considering the large value of the contract, the smaller companies fend for themselves. The cost of water has gone up by up to 40%,\u201d he said.

The single-use plastic ban came into effect on January 1, 2019. However, there are still people who do their bit to stop single-use plastic menace that's harming the environment. Nidhi Sajith Menon, a 17-year-old girl from Chennai, is one among them. She has been doing everything possible to create awareness on the ill-effects of single-use plastic, especially on marine life. On Saturday, she organised a presentation at the Backyard, Gandhi Nagar, Adyar.  \"June 8 is observed as the World Oceans Day and there are events organised throughout the month to understand the importance of conserving our oceans. So, I wanted to emphasise the point that how small changes that we make today will bring about major impact in ocean conservation. Reduce the use of plastic is the way to go about it - carry your own cloth bags when go shopping, by items which are alternatives to plastics like neem combs, steel bottles and containers, etc. In Chennai, there are several organisations that have been involved in clearing plastic waste from our water bodies. But on a daily basis, we have to be responsible enough to cut down on generating plastic waste. In fact, I was shocked to see the rampant usage of plastic even though there was good adherence to the ban initially. Unless somebody keeps talking about it, the attitude of people won't change. That's why I organised this presentation. So, I touched up on topics with some realistic visuals like that of the turtle with straw up its nostril and seahorse holding on to a cotton bud. All these are there on the internet. But having seen all this, what are we doing? That's what I addressed with this presentation. Those who attended the presentation promised to do their bit,\" shares Nidhi, who have been running an initiative called For Earth's Sake to bring about an attitudinal change in terms of plastic usage among the residents and shopkeepers of Adyar and RA Puram.

On Friday, the government announced that it was allocating Rs 499.68 crore for kudimaramathu work to be undertaken across the state.

However, no one knows how much of the work was actually carried out. Hence, the government should bring out a white paper on this,\" Dhinakaran told reporters. \"If those work had been actually carried out as sanctioned in the past, how come so much of the surplus Cauvery water was let into the sea last year, instead of diverting it to the water bodies in the delta districts, especially Nagapattinam? Farmers in the toe end regions of the delta districts were complaining that the Cauvery water had not reached them for long. Even in other regions, water bodies are in a sorry state, with bushes of 5-6 feet height,\" Dhinakaran said.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

Nadda's appointment as working president was on the cards after he was not inducted into the government. Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Congratulations to him on becoming the working president of the party,\" the Prime Minister added. Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president. Nadda has long experience of the party organisation as he was the in-charge of the party headquarters and is a popular figure.

While the ruling AIADMK is concerned about completing its full term and willing to look at this beyond 2024, the opposition DMK feels such a move is impossible to implement. AIADMK is deputing law minister C Ve Shanmugam and RS floor leader A Navaneethakrishnan to attend the all-party meeting on June 19. \u201cIn its earlier representation to the Law Commission in New Delhi last year, the party demanded that the ruling dispensation should be allowed to complete its full term until 2021, but said it had no objections to simultaneous polls from 2024, if necessary. It remains unclear if the party high command maintains its status given the political dynamics,\u201d said a senior minister, seeking anonymity. \u201cWe had already taken a stand on this and I do not think there will be any change on that now. Our utmost concern is to complete the present term. Even last year, when the topic surfaced, Modi government was to advance elections to six states, including Maharashtra and Jharkhand, which are to face assembly polls in a few months from now. But, they did not do it,\u201d pointed out another minister, who did not want to be named. The DMK was of the stand that it was impossible to implement and depended on various factors. \u201cWhile we had general elections in 1989, 1991, 1996, 1998 and 1999, the Lok Sabha was dissolved in 1991, 1998 and 1999 for want of a majority for the ruling dispensation. If such a case is to arise later, will the state assemblies, where the ruling party may be in a majority, be dissolved?\u201d wondered DMK spokesman and party\u2019s RS member T K S Elangovan. \u201cSeveral states are ruled by parties, which have little or no role at the Centre. Their mandates are different. Such a move is not needed at all and it is impossible to implement it,\u201d he said. For its part, the PMK felt there were benefits, but issues too. \u201cOur youth wing leader (Anbumani Ramadoss) had earlier said it was a good move, considering the cost benefits. But, it is practically not possible to implement. Our party is yet to take a call on this,\u201d PMK spokesman K Balu said. \u201cFrom lowering expenditure aspect, it is a welcome move. But, there are issues in implementing it,\u201d he said. Former chief election commissioner T S Krishnamurthy said theoretically it was attractive and desirable too. \u201cBut, implementation wise there are problems and needs constitutional amendments. It is difficult to implement. While administrative wise, we will need more arrangements, it will surely result in savings on expenditure and may result in more administrative work for the legislatures. But, constitutional obstacles must be addressed and changed,\u201d said Krishnamurthy.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister said an active and effective opposition is a necessity in a democracy and pointed out that a well- argued and factual criticism of the government strengthens democracy. \"Sometimes such positive contributions are not noticed as they do not get high TRPs,\" he said. Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said. Referring to his recent speeches, the Prime Minister said that \"we started with ' sab ka saath, sab ka vikas', but the people have added an unprecedented 'vishwas' (trust) to the matter\".

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

The chief minister submitted a list of proposals, seeking release of funds to the tune of Rs 17,350 crore, during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \u201cThese proposals, including GST dues from the Centre and allocation for local bodies among others, were the same that CM has repeatedly submitted to the Centre in the past three years.

The state assembly had passed resolutions seeking exemption from NEET for Tamil Nadu and EPS failed to even address this issue in his proposal,\u201d Stalin charged. Referring to Karnataka chief minister H D Kumarasamy\u2019s address to the media in New Delhi that his state did not need the permission of Tamil Nadu for constructing a dam across the Cauvery river at Mekedatu, Stalin felt EPS should have given a fitting counter to that. \u201cEPS should have consulted the chief ministers of Kerala and Puducherry and highlighted this issue too in the Niti Ayog meeting. He should have at least categorically said that dam cannot be constructed without the consent of Tamil Nadu,\u201d Stalin said.

The door of a toilet in B4 was ajar, the coach was old and the airconditioning was not working properly. \u201cDue to the open toilet door, there was a bad smell,\u201d said A Shinod, who travelled with his family to Kozhikode on the train. There was no latch on the outside and it could, thankfully, be closed only when someone was occupying it. A senior Southern Railway official, when contacted, said the primary maintenance of the coach would be done in Mangaluru and that it would be looked into. Passengers on many trains to Kerala from Chennai routinely complain about the quality of coaches, cleanliness and the general upkeep. Most of these passengers are frequent travellers with high expectations; besides, the number of coaches handled by the Trivandrum division is one of the highest in the country. Some coaches are maintained at the Chennai division\u2019s yard in Basin Bridge. Sources said the major issue was with the operation of bio-toilets which start stinking once there is a block. This happens when someone drops garbage into the pot and the bio-toilet\u2019s working is disrupted. S Subramanian, a passenger who travelled from Chengannur to Chennai on Chennai Mail earlier in June, complained that apart from the stinking toilets, the door in the AC compartment in which he travelled did not close fully which made life miserable for him. His seat was in the coupe adjacent to the toilet. Railway sources said there was an infrastructural requirement of pit lines in stations in Kerala that needed to be addressed. In some stations, the work to construct such pit lines was stuck due to bureaucratic delays. Pit lines are places where coaches are cleaned completely. In Kerala, five coaching depots have 14 pit lines, whereas Basin bridge alone has 19 pit lines, as per official railway data.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.
