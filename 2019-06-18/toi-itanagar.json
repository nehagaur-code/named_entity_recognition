State NPP leader and former home minister Kumar Waii had termed Aboh\u2019s killing as a political assassination by his rivals. \u201cEveryone knew he was going to win. He, too, had told me that he was confident of retaining his seat,\u201d said Waii. Aboh, who was known as a no-nonsense politician, often received threats from the NSCN(I-M) for his opposition to their presence in Arunachal. This was the second time that suspected NSCN(I-M) rebels have resorted to killings in Arunachal since the announcement of the assembly and Lok Sabha election dates. On March 29, they killed Jaley Anna, one of Aboh\u2019s supporters from NPP, in Kheti village of Tirap district. The Tirap Changlang Longding Society Delhi, under the banner of the Arunachal Students\u2019 Union Delhi, on Thursday organized a prayer meet and candlelight vigil at Arunachal House in the national capital to express solidarity with the families of those who lost their lives in the ambush.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Yet, the saffron party and its allies walked away with 18 of the 25 seats up for grabs in the northeastern states, successfully weathering the storm of unrest that rocked most parts of Assam, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram. The Congress, the grand old part of India, was restricted to just four seats, while its allies bagged two. One constituency was won by an Independent candidate. When protest broke out against the Centre's plan to bring the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB), 2016, dubbed to be against the interest of the indigenous people of the region, many political commentators believed that it would mar the BJP's chances in the general elections in the North East. The bill had proposed to give citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis from Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Violent agitations in Assam, Manipur along with protests in Mizoram, Meghalaya and Tripura against the bill forced the Centre to abort plans to introduce it in Rajya Sabha allowing it to lapse. However, proving the naysayers wrong, the BJP and its allies gained majorly, especially in Assam where a total of 14 seats were up for grabs. BJP on its own won in nine seats in the state. In 2014, the saffron party had won seven seats. On the other hand, the Congress won three seats, the same as in 2014. Its ally All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) won one seat, down from three in 2014 while one constituency went to an Independent candidate. In Arunachal Pradesh, Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju led a clean sweep for the BJP on the two Lok Sabha seats in the state, routing the Congress. While Rijiju retained his Arunachal West seat, his party colleague Tapir Gao trumped Congress candidate Lowangcha Wanglat in the Arunachal East constituency. Assam Finance Minister and BJP leader Himanta Biswa Sarma said the win for the NDA in the region was all because of the \"tremendous development\" of the North East under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. \"He has brought a new era for the people of the North East. Today, every part of the North East is connected with Railways, internet and now, there is also air connectivity in every state (of the region),\" he said. In Manipur, the BJP and the Naga Peoples Front won the Inner Manipur and Outer Manipur seats respectively, both of which were won by the Congress in 2014. The BJP further strengthened its position in the region by wresting the two constituencies -- Tripura East and Tripura West -- in Tripura from the Congress. In 2014, both these seats were won by the CPI(M). NDA ally Sikkim Krantikari Morcha added muscle to the coalition grabbing the lone seat in Sikkim by defeating the Sikkim Democratic Front's candidate. In Mizoram, NDA ally Mizo National Front's nominee C Lalrosanga defeated Independent candidate Lalnghinglova Hmar by 8,140 votes in the only Lok Sabha constituency of the state. Congress had won the seat in the last term. BJP ally Democratic Progressive Party's Tokheho Yepthomi won the lone seat in Nagaland defeating Congress candidate K L Chishi by 16,344 votes in a seesaw contest. In a breather for the Congress, the party won the Shillong seat in Meghalaya although it lost Tura constituency to NDA ally National People's Party. The two parties had also won the respective seats in 2014. Going by the outcome, the BJP can claim that the Lotus (its party symbol) is well and truly blooming in the North East.

The new species of reddish brown pit viper - a venomous snake with a unique heat-sensing system - was found in a forest in West Kameng district by a team of herpetologists led by Ashok Captain, the Forest department official said. The discovery was published in the March-April volume of Russian Journal of Herpetology. Captain said India had four brown pit vipers - Malabar, Horseshoe, Hump-nosed and Himalayan - before the Arunachal Pradesh discovery. \"We don't know anything of the Arunachal pit viper's natural history as only one male has been found so far. More surveys and sightings of this species would gradually give us an idea of its habits, diet and breeding, whether it lays eggs or bears live young,\" he said. A research team from Pune-based Indian Institute of Science Education and Research found the snake while conducting biodiversity surveys in Eaglenest region of Arunachal Pradesh. A resident of the area had first shown the snake to the team in a forest patch near Ramda village. Comparative analyses of DNA sequences and examination of morphological features suggested that the snake belonged to a species not described before.

The National Health Profile (NHP), 2018, released by the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI) last year, reported that Assam 225 deaths (highest in region) due to ARI in 2017, followed by Mizoram (36), Manipur (23) and Tripura 21 deaths. Nagaland recorded nine deaths, Sikkim (8), Meghalaya (7) and Arunchal Pradesh (3). In 2016, Assam recorded 200 deaths due to ARI, Mizoram (68), Sikkim (43), Manipur (21), Tripura (7) and Arunchal Pradesh (4). However, Nagaland didn't record any death due to ARI that year. The NHP, 2018, highlighted Meghalaya had the highest number of ARI cases (3,33,772) cases among eight states in the region in 2017. Tripura, with 1,78,570 ARI cases, is in the second position followed by Sikkim (93,270), Manipur (51,205), Arunachal Pradesh (36,250), Nagaland (31,158), Mizoram (29,595) and Assam (22,834).

The places are Guwahati, Nalbari, Nagaon, Silchar & Sivasagar. Bhattacharyya said particulate matter (PM2.5) pollutants are more dangerous than PM10 level in the air. Former Meghalaya governor RS Mushahary said the government has to do a lot for fulfilling the 'Pollution Free Environment' agenda. He added that citizens have to be involved in achieving this goal.

Aaranyak said Guwahati's air is found to have very high content of black carbon. \"There must be a paradigm change in our public transport system and related policy to bring down the rapid growth of vehicles out on the roads by introducing a mass transit system that will also help in climate change mitigation. Introduction of clean fuel and discouraging prevalence of dirty fuels as a policy strategy will go a long way in curbing vehicular air pollution,\" said an Aaranyak official.

Ever since he took charge as chief minister of the key state bordering China in July 2016, Khandu and his cabinet coleagues have shifted their loyalties twice - first from Congress to People's Party of Arunachal (PPA) and then to BJP. And all this happened within a span of just five months. Son of former chief minister Dorjee Khandu, who died in a helicopter crash in 2011, Pema Khandu was inducted into his successor Nabam Tuki's government as water resource development minister. Though Khandu joined Congress in 2000, he was hardly known in political circles until his father's death. He had served as a secretary of state Congress in 2005 and as the head of the Tawang unit of the party in 2010. Khandu made his maiden entry into the assembly when he won the by-election uncontested from Mukto, his father's constituency, in June, 2011. Khandu won the seat unopposed for a second time in 2014 and became the tourism minister in the Nabam Tuki government. The scenario for him began changing after President's Rule was imposed on January 26, 2016, following a constitutional breakdown in the state due to agitations against Tuki. When President's Rule was lifted 26 days later, he became a minister in the BJP-supported Kalikho Pul government, which had replaced the Tuki dispensation. But the Pul government lasted for only six months as the Supreme Court turned the political clock back and reinstalled Tuki as the chief minister on July 14 that year. But Tuki resigned just two days later, hours before proving majority, and was succeeded by Khandu as the Congress chief minister. Exactly three months after assuming chief ministership, he, along with 43 MLAs from Congress, defected to PPA, an ally of BJP. Khandu was, however, suspended from PPA along with six other lawmakers in December that year for anti-party activities. The same month, he joined BJP along with most of the PPA legislators and proved majority in the floor of the House. A music aficionado, Khandu is known for belting out Kishore Kumar and Mohammad Rafi numbers in official parties. He also patronised talent search among local youths to preserve traditional songs by conducting talent shows in Tawang and West Kameng districts. Khandu is also fond of football, cricket, badminton and volleyball. He organised cricket tournaments in his constituency and promoted sportspersons of the state in various national and international events. A history graduate from Delhi's Hindu College, Khandu belongs to the Monpa tribe which dominates Tawang and parts of West Kameng districts. He is a Buddhist by religion. Ahead of the assembly polls, which was held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha elections, he had promised a corruption-free and people-friendly government as his poll plank.

The field study was conducted between July 2017 and February 2018. The report's socioeconomic survey section said that all the 46 people who were asked with the several questionnaires on the proposed project were categorically against construction of the dam. \"All of them who were interviewed were aware of the construction of the dam. Not a single person agreed to the construction of the dam. This is because the dam will nearly submerge a large part of the area, including settlements of the people and 13th century stupa, the Gorzam Chorten, which has great cultural and historical significance,\" the report released late last month said. Zemithang valley in Tawang district has a population of 2,805 in 12 villages. Buddhist Monpas are the predominant community in the district. The Monpas also in West Kameng district of the state reveres black-necked cranes that breed in Ladakh and China as an embodiment of the sixth Dalai Lama who was born in 1683 in Tawang that borders with China's Tibet. The locals who call the bird as Trung-Trung Karmo, considers the arrival of black-necked cranes as norbu (good fortune). Further, the report said people interviewed were aware of the fact that hunting was not allowed in the Black-necked cranes' wintering habitat due to the \"local religious belief\" of the Monpas. \"Only a few of the people had heard about one death, which had been caused by some outsiders,\" the report said. The three kilometer stretch of Nyamjang Chhu (river in Monpa language) between Brojenthang and Zemithang in the valley is one of the two wintering sites of black-necked cranes in India. The other site is Sangti, also in Arunachal Pradesh. The wintering site in Nyamjang Chhu also overlapped with the barrage for the proposed 780 MW hydro-electric project. WII's report has categorically said that the construction of the dam would \"eventually submerge the entire habitat of vulnerable black-necked crane in Zemithang.\" It said that the sample group consisted of young to middle-aged people \"who have been observing the cranes only from the recent past.\" \"But a few of the elders had answered about their (Black-necked cranes) presence from the early 20th century. This shows that the area has been used by Black-necked cranes as a critical wintering site for a very long period of time,\" the report said. Monks who under the banner of Save Mon Region Federation (SMRF) has been protesting against Nyamjang Chhu and 12 other hydro-electric projects in Tawang took the WII's report as a \"moral victory\" of their movement. The WII report is an outcome of a 2016 order by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that suspended the environmental clearance given to the project and asked the environment ministry to conduct a study on the environmental impact of the project. In 2012 SMRF challenged in NGT the environmental clearance granted to Nyamjang Chhu on the ground that the project developer did not reveal the wintering site of black-necked crane in the environment impact assessment (EIA) report commissioned by the project developer.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Arunachal Pradesh is the second state after Nagaland where the JD(U) has been able to make its footprint. It is a testimony to the growing appeal of our brand of politics that focusses on social justice coupled with development, Tyagi said.

Congratulations to him on becoming the working president of the party,\" the Prime Minister added. Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah.

Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Navya Naveli Nanda": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/amitabh-bachchans-granddaughter-navya-naveli-nanda-works-out-on-a-busy-new-york-street-video-goes-viral/videoshow/69835936.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Daughter returns from Oz to revive martyr's memorial in Arunachal Pradesh": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/itanagar/daughter-returns-from-oz-to-revive-martyrs-memorial-in-arunachal-pradesh/articleshow/69502712.cms", "time": "2019-05-26 10:50:00", "description": "BENGALURU: When Cheryl Dalby got a call from old classmate Rita Joseph earlier this year, little did she know what would unfold in the coming months.  \"When we were chatting, I happened to mention that my father had served in the Indian Army and died in action.

It was my father,\" Cheryl told STOI .  Ollapally - also part of the school's Old Boys' Association (OBA), formed in 1918 after a few old boys returned from serving in World War I - had accidentally found Dalby's memorial in remote Jaswanthgarh, Arunachal Pradesh. But the name lingered in his mind and research later revealed it was Captain Dalby who had laid down his life in the Indo-China war of 1962.  When Ollapally found the OBA hadn't honoured him, he began scouting for his family, and eventually found Cheryl through Rita, who lives in the US. \"Thanks to them, I was able to come down from Perth and visit my father's memorial in Arunachal Pradesh. I have now refurbished the memorial and it looks wonderful,\" said Cheryl. Cheryl said she was then invited to the artillery centre and also participated in Raising Day celebrations of her father's 5 Field Regiment. Besides Dalby, the OBA tracked down three other martyrs who hadn't been honoured by the association. On Saturday, the OBA honoured all the four soldiers by laying wreaths at a memorial in the school and etching their names on it. The other three soldiers are: Major Uday Shankar Ghosh from 13 Sikh Light Infantry, who died in June 1989 as part of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka; Major Sylvester Rajesh Ratnam, who died in Jammu and Kashmir as part of Operation Parakram in 2002 and Major Palecanda Atul Devaiah from Maratha Light Infantry, who died in Siachen Glacier during Operation Meghdoot in February 1987. The OBA also unveiled plaques of the soldiers, which will be placed in the school. Family members of all the soldiers, retired soldiers and others took part in the ceremony. \"The OBA was formed after World War I as they felt the need to celebrate friendships. It is only befitting that we have gathered to honour martyred soldiers,\" said the organisers.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times.

Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The 9,129-sq-km valley is home to the Asiatic golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) in six different colour variations, as Indian scientists from the international conservation charity organization Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and University College London found out. This is the most diverse range of colour morphs found in a single locality, according to the study published in the Ecological Society of America's journal, 'Ecology', on June 7. \"We now know the Dibang Valley hosts the world's most diverse range of colour morphs of a wild cat species ever reported in one site, but we are only just starting to understand this rare ecological phenomenon,\" said Sahil Nijhawan, lead author of the study and British Academy Fellow at ZSL's Institute of Zoology and UCL. A colour morph is an occurrence of a variation of colour, a discrete one, in a species because of mutation. It takes hold of a population through natural selection.  The Asiatic golden cat - the largest group of small Asian felines - is found across eastern Nepal, through northeast India, Myanmar, Thailand and China, all the way to Sumatra and Indonesia. It is listed as a Near Threatened species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. While it was known that the species exhibits many variations, the extent had not been explored. So in 2014, Sahil and his colleagues set out to study the feline species in the Dibang Valley. They conducted a camera camera trap study across 223 locations of the Dibang Valley - in both community forest and protected areas - between January 2014 and September 2015. That was when they noticed something strange. In the 75 independent photographic records of the Asiatic golden cat, they found groups that looked entirely different from each other. The result - documentation of six colour morphs: tightly-rosetted, cinnamon, ocelot, melanistic, grey and golden. Why these colour morphs have endured could be put down to the one keystone of evolution - adaptability. Of these, tightly-rosetted - initially called \"leopard-like rosettes tightly spaced on its grey coat - is an entirely new colour morph, found in community-owned forests. The cinnamon and ocelot morphs are also unique - previously found in Bhutan and China, their occurrence has been recorded in India for the first time. Why these colour morphs have endured could be put down to the one keystone of evolution - adaptability.

The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

Those injured in the Achabal gunfight and IED blast were rushed to the Army's 92 Base hospital in Srinagar, officials said. In the third attack in 24 hours, terrorists lobbed a grenade at the headquarters of the 180 CRPF battalion camp in Tral sub-district of Pulwama late on Monday evening. The grenade exploded outside the headquarters. No casualties have been reported. The first attack happened on Monday morning when a team of security men was on a cordon-and-search operation in Achabal. Terrorists fired at the team, who then retaliated. In the Pulwama attack, the terrorists after setting off the IED, opened fire at the Army vehicle. \"Initial reports reveal the vehicle suffered extensive damage,\" the official said. Three of the soldiers injured in the blast were said to be serious, sources said. Soon after the attack, Army, police and SOG reinforcements were rushed to the spot and a massive search operation was launched. A defence spokesman, however, said some of the men sustained minor injuries in the IED blast. Damage was minimal due to the alertness of the patrol party, he said. The vehicle was an armoured ALS and not a Casspir (a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle), he added.

On April 1, Kashyap Boruah, an employee of Udipta Energy Oil Company, was kidnapped by unidentified miscreants while he was travelling in his company vehicle at Innao at Maitripur in Diyun circle of the district. They were stopped by two armed men in Army fatigue who directed them to leave the vehicle on the road and forced them to walk with them towards a forest area. Later, a little deep inside the forest, the driver was released after snatching his mobile. Boruah's abductors told him that they belong to an insurgent outfit and had kidnapped him for ransom. On receipt of the complaint, a case was registered at Diyun police station and investigation began, said SP (Changlang) Romil Baaniya. He added that the kidnappers had demanded a ransom of Rs 3 crore for his release. After negotiations, the ransom amount was reduced to Rs 40 lakh which was delivered to the kidnappers on April 29 in the Sukha Nallah area by the company. Boruah was released the same day. After Boruah's release, an operation to nab the kidnappers and also recover the amount paid as ransom was launched jointly by the Changlang Police headed by the SP and the Army under the supervision of DIGP (Eastern Range) Take Ringu. During the operation, all locations used as shelters and the persons suspected to be involved in facilitating the kidnappers were raided based on local intelligence inputs leading to the arrest of the two main accused - Boksu Chakma and Sikko Chakma - along with eight other persons who had helped them in committing the crime.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.
