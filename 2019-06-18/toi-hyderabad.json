At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Marauders of Hope: Book launch": {"link": "http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/events/hyderabad/marauders-of-hope-book-launch/articleshow/69801696.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Road broken for water line rectification": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/roadbrokenforwaterlinerectification/articleshow/69834433.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Shah Rukh Khan": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/shah-rukh-khan-and-his-son-aryan-khan-are-all-set-to-voice-for-the-lion-king-in-hindi/articleshow/69819993.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Satta Matka 2018": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/agra-court-rejects-satta-king-shyam-vohra-bail-plea/articleshow/65506776.cms", "time": "", "description": "AGRA: Shyam Vohra, known as 'satta king' of the Taj city, was denied bail by district court of Agra.

Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

The city has turned into a concrete jungle, rainwater has hardly found a place in the scheme of things,\u201d said Ilayas Shamshi, chairman, Team NGOs India which is organising the event.

The amalgam that apposed diametrically divergent and distinguishing styles was enthralling, to say the least.  the group started with Vande Mataram fused with Sare Jahan Se Achha, keeping in mind the Independene Day fervour.

The last such occurrence when the monsoon hit the region when it was part of the united Andhra Pradesh after June 27 was in the year 1972 \u2014 47 years ago. In 2018, monsoon hit Telangana on June 4 bringing an early cheer on the faces of farmers. According to weathermen, monsoon usually hits the state between June 7-10. But, this time round, the likelihood of monsoon rains delaying beyond June 27 is also not being ruled out. In 1972, Kerala experienced the first southwest monsoon rains on June 17, a delay of 17 days from its normal onset date of June 1. The unified Andhra Pradesh received monsoon rains 10 days later \u2014 June 27. This was 47 years ago. Going by the delay in the system moving north-north centralwards, it could derail the monsoon\u2019s ascent and its arrival could be delayed further beyond June 27, officials explained. Senior officials recall that monsoon was delayed five years ago in Telangana despite hitting Kerala on June 6. \u201cThere was a delay of 14 days in the monsoon reaching Telangana because of various factors and the trajectory of the monsoon that year. This year, monsoon struck Kerala on June 8. By the time it makes its way into Telangana, it could be beyond June 25-27,\u201d an official reasoned. \u201cThis year, it is going to be a slow and sluggish start due to various reasons. Two key factors are the speed of the westerlies and long-wave radiation,\u201d officials said.

However, once breaches have been created, these are used by people for illegal activity. Many locals skip paying entry fee this way and others dump their waste. At night some youngsters even enter through the breaches and use drugs.\u201d Aziz Mohammed, another resident says, \u201cThere is no police patrolling here at all. Guards must be placed at different spots so that the lake is saved from nuisance makers. If people are prevented from throwing their garbage here, those living nearby can at least have healthy lives without the stench and mosquitoes. Besides this, unruly elements will be kept at bay.\u201d When contacted, irrigation department officials said the matter has to be dealt with by the sanitation wing of the GHMC. However, repeated calls and messages sent to the sanitation in-charge went unanswered.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Heavy water logging": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/heavywaterlogging/articleshow/69821377.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Maoists wade into podu land controversy, \u2018instigate\u2019 villagers": {"description": "HYDERABAD: Taking advantage of the \u2018podu bhumulu\u2019 (podu land) controversy, Communist Party of India (Maoist) leaders are allegedly trying to instigate locals of the affected villages in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district. After learning about the movement of Telangana State Committee secretary Haribhushan and Khammam Karimnagar Warangal (KKW) secretary Damodar in several villages of the district, a 3,000-member strong contingent of Telangana police, including the anti-Maoist elite force Greyhounds, has started combing operations in the tribal hamlets. The Supreme Court had earlier directed the state to evict villagers in possession of podu land in Karakagudem, Yedula, Bayyaram, Gundala and Manugodu. The apex court, however, stayed its own order. The villagers have been on protest path since then. The forest land under podu, a form of shifting cultivation, has been a controversial issue for a long time and TRS government had earlier assured that it would resolve the issue, but it was still hanging fire.

Sunkara Chandrasekhar (44), his wife Lavanya (41) and their two sons aged 15 and 10, were shot and killed, a police statement said. The family was originally from Tsundur in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s Guntur district and were living in the US for at least the past two decades. On Saturday at around 10 am, a local resident contacted the emergency number 911 after being informed about gun shots being heard in Chandrasekhar\u2019s house. Police officials, who rushed to the spot, found the four lying dead with gunshot wounds. Sources close to the family said that they had moved into the house only in March. A family friend, who is also a member of Telugu Association of North America (TANA), told TOI on condition of anonymity that Chandrasekhar has been suffering from depression for a while and that there might have been a dispute in the family. In an Instagram post, local police explained that at the time of the shooting other family members, including two adults and two children, were living in the house as guests. After discovering the bodies, one of them rushed out looking for help. He found someone who then called up 911. The police have not revealed the identity of the guests. Although the police have not given any details about the motive behind the shooting, they have stated that there is no immediate threat to the community and that the deaths directly affect their family friends and co-workers. They have also said that investigations had revealed that at the time of the gun being fired, no outsider had entered the house. This is being interpreted by many that a family dispute may be behind the deaths. Chandrasekhar worked for the Iowa department of public safety\u2019s technology services bureau. Sources added that Lavanya too was a software developer. Friends and acquaintances cited his work excellence certificates claiming that he was a hardworking employee. TANA members got in touch with family members in Tsundur and were told that everyone was in a state of shock. They also rejected any help saying that they did not want any attention.

Recent satellite images seem to indicate so. Interestingly, forest officials have found that not only Adivasis, even non-tribals are encroaching upon the forest land. They squarely blamed the people of Gond and Kolam tribes for the indiscriminate cutting of trees. Kagaznagar forest divisional officer Raja Ramana Reddy told TOI that several areas (compartments) had been cleared of green cover in the Garlapet reserved forest in Kagaznagar section between 2010 and 2018. \u201cSatellite mapping has clearly revealed this. Apart from Adivasis, non-tribals are also resorting to large-scale encroachments. Gonds and Kolams are chopping trees,\u201d he said. Forest officials said 6.4 lakh acres of forest land is disputed and several court cases are pending. Senior officials said the forest area in united Khammam, Adilabad and Warangal districts is worst-affected where land in huge tracts is encroached upon. Ramana said Kolams belonging to Wankidi mandal in Kumaram Bheem-Asifabad district had encroached forest land in 70 acres after making incursions 30 km into the forest. \u201cWe had served notices to them in February. When we issued eviction notices, they approached the high court, which asked us to follow the due process of law,\u201d he explained. The tribals were given time till May 15. \u201cHowever, they moved the court again. We explained the ground situation to the court,\u201d Ramana said. The forest officials are also wary about rise in attacks on them. When some forest officials tried to stop encroachment in 460 compartments of Manchippa reserve forest in Gandhari range on May 29, villagers attacked them. Forest section officer Venkata Swamy was injured when the encroachers rammed a tractor into him. In fact, attempts by senior forest officials to stop fresh felling have led to friction between the department and Adivasis. Eviction of Kolam tribals on June 12 was taken kindly by tribals and non-tribals in Asifabad district. In September 2017, eviction of Gothikoyas from forest land by the officials in Jayashankar Bhupalpally district had led to an outrage all across the state.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

He said within six months of purchase, he noticed several problems in the car, including noise from the engine, broken lock level on the right-hand side rear door, faulty horn and a crack on the front side windshield. He submitted that he immediately rushed to the showroom and then to authorised service center to get these problems rectified, but instead of replacing the old horn with a new one, they tried to repair the defective piece. Reddy claimed that next day, while going to work, he could still hear the noise from the engine and the horn was not functioning. He further claimed that due to the faulty horn, he was forced to drive slow and it resulted in an accident. He said that because of slow driving the vehicle was consuming more petrol and also he had to leave early for work and was reaching home late. Claiming that Maruti Suzuki and Varun Motors failed to rectify the problems despite multiple complaints, he filed this complaint in the consumer forum seeking compensation. The representatives of Maruti, in their written version, submitted that Sudharshan Reddy did not lodge any complaint with regard to non-working of the horn, but only stated that the horn was defective. They said that they had adjusted the horn and delivered it on the same day as the horn was working after adjustment. They claimed that the complainant\u2019s allegation that an accident took place due to non-working of the horn is false. Varun Motors representatives, meanwhile, contended that they are only responsible for providing services during the warranty period and there is no deficiency on their part. During the trial, the bench said, \u201cThere is always the likelihood of occurrence of an accident in the absence of functional horn, especially in Hyderabad traffic. The horn in the context of heavy traffic in Hyderabad is essential for smooth running of vehicles and to prevent accidents. The contention of the opposite parties that there is no possibility of an accident if the horn is not functioning, is therefore without any basis and it\u2019s quite untenable.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/maruti-suzuki-car-showroom-told-to-pay-rs-1l-to-consumer-for-faulty-horn/articleshow/69817477.cms", "time": "2019-06-17 08:36:00"}, "3-year-old boy dies in road accident": {"description": "Hyderabad: A three-year-old boy died in a road accident in Alair on Sunday afternoon when his family was returning home on a bike after attending festivities at a temple.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader.

Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\".

Reason: No clarity yet whether he is an Indian or a Pakistan national. India\u2019s efforts to deport Keshwani came to a nought after Pakistan refused to accept him as its citizen. In January 2004, Keshwani alias Saleem Keshwani alias Akbar Ali was arrested by the Sadar police in Agra along with one Sameer under Section 3 of the Passport Act and Section 14 of the Foreigners Act. When Keshwani was in judicial remand in Agra prison, Task Force police of Hyderabad had arrested one Mallik Arshad Mahemood alias Arshad Mahemood alias Arshad Mallik, a Pakistani national, from an Internet cafe at Agarwal Chambers, Koti, on March 8, 2004. Subsequently, police raided Mallik\u2019s rented accommodation at Mutyal Bagh, Abids, and recovered evidence suggesting that he was carrying out espionage activities by gathering information about defence establishments in Secunderabad. On interrogation, Mallik allegedly confessed that he got Rs 30,000 from Mumbai-based hawala operator Keshwani in August 2003. Based on his confession, police named Keshwani as accused number 2 in the case and charged him under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act, Sections 3 and 9 of the Official Secrets Act and IPC Sections 120-B, 419, 420, 468, 471. When Keshwani\u2019s term at the Agra prison was nearing completion in 2013, SIT sleuths had brought him to Hyderabad on transit warrant and lodged him at the Cherlapally prison. Keshwani plealded not guilty to all the charges levelled against him and, after the trial, on March 9, 2015, a local court had acquitted him. While acquitting him, the court had observed that \u201cthe prosecution has not produced any evidence to show that Keshwani is a Pakistani national. At the same time, Keshwani has not produced any evidence to show that he is an Indian and not a foreign national\u201d. The court had observed that prosecution also failed to provide any evidence to show that Keshwani has provided money to convicted accused Mallik and his confession alone was not sufficient to prove Keshwani\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy. After the acquittal, Telangana prison authorities, through the state government, had made several attempts to initiate proceedings to deport Keshwani to Pakistan. \u201cBut, Pakistan authorities refused to accept Keshwani as their citizen. Keshwani claims to be from Mumbai, but he does not have any family member or any document to support his claims. As a result, he continues to remain in detention at Cherlapally prison through a state government order,\u201d a Cherlapally prison official said. The 70-year-old is lodged in a separate cell. Director-general, Prisons, V K Singh said cases like Keshwani\u2019s take some time to reach a logical conclusion. \u201cIt takes some time to deport foreign prisoners as the procedure involves communication between multiple agencies.

The groundwater department measures water levels according to mandals. Both Gachibowli and Financial District are categorised under the Serlingampally mandal. The department\u2019s report for the 2018-2019 up to May shows that the current average in Serlingampally is 13.79 metres below ground level (mbgl) from 10.85mbgl last year. While groundwater level reduced by 2.94mbgl on paper, what is more frightening is that the department does not have historical records of specific areas such as Gachibowli or Nalagandla. Chandra Reddy said, \u201cThe actual levels could be as poor as 25mbgl to 30mbgl. This is because the rocky landscape does not allow water to permeate. Also poor rains and mindless concretization are to blame.\u201d \u201cFor measuring the groundwater, one needs to have separate borewells dug. These areas have rocky terrain and do not easily allow for such deep borewells,\u201d said Chandra Reddy, adding that required infrastructure will be created under the Phase 2 of World Bank project. Rainfall is the principal source of input for groundwater recharge. In Ranga Reddy district, under which Serlingampally falls, 487.9mm rainfall was recorded against the normal rainfall of 692.8mm during 2018-2019 (up to May). This is 29.6 per cent less than the normal. Sources in the Hyderabad Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) said that the problem is due to lack of rains and consequent drying up of Manjeera and Singur water sources.

Trees with shallow roots can be moved, but those deep-rooted need adequate space and follow-up, which never happens.\u201d A campaign to \u2018Save the banyans of Chevella\u2019 has seen many resident groups oppose translocation. They say that translocating the stump of a tree destroys the entire ecosystem surrounding it. \u201cThese trees mitigate heat, cut down pollution and are home to varied species. What is the point of reducing them to a stump? One would have to wait two generations to see them grow back,\u201d says Kobita Dass Kolli, who is part of the campaign. She also says officials have not been able to provide data to show that translocation works. Speaking about what is at stake, she says, \u201cOne will not raze the Qutub Shahi Tombs. Similarly, how can we cut down or move trees that are our heritage?\u201d Members of Nature Lovers of Hyderabad that have been backing \u2018Save the banyans of Chevella\u2019 movement say that only one of over 10 trees translocated on Hyderabad-Chevella-Bijapur (NH164) highway has survived. Tejah Balantrapu, who is among the campaigners, says, \u201cOur approach to translocation is piece-meal and haphazard. We have no accepted standards for every stage of the process. We have no systematic recordkeeping. The translocators have good intentions, but it\u2019s almost impossible to evaluate the end result.\u201d Officials, too, are at their wits end. An official from National Highways Authority of India said there are no definite rules regarding the process. \u201cIn most past cases, trees have not survived translocation.\u201d Uday Krishna Peddireddi, who has stared the Vata Foundation, is a strong proponent of translocation. \u201cWhen the only option the government provides is the axing of a tree, I would rather give it a chance,\u201d says Peddireddi, adding, \u201cNaysayers must provide an alternate solution to the government when it says realignment is not an option.\u201d He vouches for the translocation process stating \u201cWith the banyans, I can guarantee 100% survival.\u201d He promised to translocate the trees at Hyderabad-Chevella-Bijapur road for free.
