Nadda's appointment as working president was on the cards after he was not inducted into the government. Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Congratulations to him on becoming the working president of the party,\" the Prime Minister added. Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president.

The drive has emerged as a platform for modern Indian women, who\u2019ve resolved to take up new challenges and voice their concern on issues affecting women. Times Women\u2019s Drive is supported by Women\u2019s Cancer Initiative Tata Memorial Hospital, conducted by IARC. Interestingly, the drive had set Guinness World Record on February 22, 2014 for most female participants in a motorsport event, with 934 contestants.  This year, the drive was made more challenging by increasing the distance and making it a two-day event. The new test drive did not deter the participants, but further strengthened their resolve. After concluding what\u2019s touted to be the longest two-day drive in the country, participants reached Goa to attend the glittering award ceremony, which set the momentum for International Women\u2019s Day. Chief Minister of Goa, Laxmikant Yashwant Parsekar, attended the award ceremony and welcomed all the women participants from Maharashtra and Karnataka to the sunny state of Goa. He spoke about diverse schemes implemented by the state of Goa for women\u2019s welfare and made an appeal to all participants to enjoy the natural beauty and cultural diversity of the state by extending their stay.

To many, it may seem that the 19-year-old is exploring his culinary skills, but Ritesh (full name withheld) is trying to give the term higher education a new meaning. With his parents out and nearly a dozen friends in his house, the teenager is mixing bricks of hashish with brownies to bake hash-brownies or pot-brownies. From villages to urban areas, from corridors of schools to hostels of professional colleges, drugs are available easily in Goa and it is these schoolchildren and students who have become prey to substance abuse. Under pressure to look \u2018kewl\u2019, more and more Goan students, especially in hostels, are consuming drugs in their food. While there is no statistical evidence to this, anecdotal experience suggests that hash-laced brownies are being innocuously passed around in school corridors and outside the campus. With fewer glaze-eyed youths having needle marks, parents are none the wiser about the intoxicating substance lurking inside what looks like a harmless piece of cake. \u201cSmoking a joint relaxes me, I began to take it due to exam stress,\u201d said Ryan D (full name withheld). Ryan has since dropped out of medical school and is seeking assistance to kick the habit. If one knows the right people, hash, cocaine, heroin, LSD, ecstasy and meth is easily available for the right price. \u201cCannabis (smoking up) is the most common method, the gateway drug. It leads to consumption of other substances, as users pursue greater highs,\u201d said Ravindra Agrawal, a psychiatrist who runs counselling clinics in Panaji, Vasco and Margao. Most drugs make its way to Goa by train and through the state\u2019s porous borders and is sourced from Mumbai, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Gokarna in Karnataka, and the Andhra Pradesh-Odhisa border districts. The \u2018stuff\u2019 is then sold at internet cafes, money exchange shops, shacks or by friends. Marijuana comes a lot cheap as compared to other intoxicating substances and youth embrace it owing to its association with \u2018creativity\u2019 and \u2018off-beat\u2019 mood, said a law student from Goa. \u201cUnless there is complete breakdown of parental supervision, this usually happens from 9th class onwards, as the child starts becoming increasingly independent,\u201d said Agrawal. \u201cThe risk is highest in hostels of professional colleges, where parental supervision is the least. The most important risk factors irrespective of what the situation of the child is peer pressure. The need to \u2018fit-in\u2019 is a great motivator,\u201d he said. Hashish, also known as hash or charas, is sourced from the female cannabis plant, from where marijuana (ganja) also comes from. However, while dry flowering buds and even leaves of the cannabis plant are ground and used to \u201csmoke-up\u201d a joint of weed, to produce hashish one has to separate the resin from the flower and then crush the resin to release the oils. A recent global mental health study conducted by one of the experts in the field, Vikram Patel, found that schoolgoing children used drugs and other substances including tobacco, cannabis and alcohol to cope with stress. Agarwal said besides cannabis, he has come across cocaine and heroin addicts, too. Ecstasy, meth and LSD, while popular in the party going circuit, are not common among students and adolescents. A psychiatrist from North Goa, who specialises in addiction research, said students often tell him during awareness sessions in colleges and higher secondary schools that cannabis is easily available even in Goan villages. \u201cThis puts paid to the commonly held belief that access to drugs is restricted to the beach belt and only to western tourists,\u201d the psychiatrist said. ANC will take care of it: CMChief minister Pramod Sawant, who also holds the home portfolio, said the anti-narcotic cell (ANC) of Goa police was tackling the drug menace very effectively. \u201cAt present, ANC is doing very good work. I have taken a review and will be meeting them regularly to tighten it further. They will take care of the whole state\u2026 schools, educational institutions and others,\u201d Sawant told TOI.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress.

We took the ODP as a base map. But the government has asked us to make a fresh land use map and register to identify all structures, including small structures and also government structures and pumping stations,\u201d Lobo said. Every structure, whether residential, commercial, government and even utilities will be mapped this time to ensure that land utilization is clearly depicted in the ODP. The planning body will also identify encroachments on government and private land. Lobo, however, did not specify what action will be taken against such encroachments. \u201cThere is a lot of land touching the river where there are encroachments. There is land which has been used for various government projects which otherwise on the plan is shown as orchard or vacant land. We need to specify what it has been used for,\u201d Lobo said. NGPDA will begin the process by issuing a public notice inviting objections and suggestions from the public. The entire process to map the structures in Mapusa and Panaji will be contracted to a private agency which will then prepare the land use map. This time around, Lobo said, NGPDA has also decided to get on board councillors from the local municipal bodies.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs.

It is just a (small) set of people who are complaining.\u201d The swimming pool at the Peddem sports complex was constructed in the early nineties, while the complex was renovated in 2013 ahead of the Lusofonia Games. \u201cThere is a need for a new swimming pool here.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath. The Pro tem speaker ruled that the members stick to the format provided. After this, the members of BJP started adding 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' after end of every oath. Some of the prominent names who took oath from Madhya Pradesh included K P Yadav who defeated Jyotiraditya Scindia, Rakesh Singh, Ramakant Bhargava and Nakul Nath.

All outpatient departments (OPDs) and routine operations were held as per schedule,\u201d said dean of Goa Medical College, Dr S M Bandekar. \u201cI was informed on Sunday late night by the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD) that they will not participate in the strike,\u201d he said. The vice-president of GARD, Dr Nathan Pinto told TOI that they decided to cancel the protest following positive developments in West Bengal. \u201cThe talks between the government and doctors turned fruitful. The resident doctors in Maharashtra too withdrew their strike,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying our level best to make the legislation happen in Goa. Other parts of India can take cue from us and enact the law protecting doctors,\u201d said former IMA Goa state president, Prasad Netravalkar. The morcha was led by Dr Anil Mehndiratta, president, IMA, Goa branch. Members of Nursing Association, Goa Association of Medical Representatives led by Nilesh Bagkar, Chemists and Drugs Association and Physiotherapist Association also took part.

With Campal swimming pool shut for refurbishment for the Games, almost 50 swimmers from the state are left in the lurch as they don\u2019t have the required infrastructure to train.  Though they moved to the Peddem sports complex at Mapusa to train, a national-level swimmer said they dread at the thought of entering the murky waters of the pool.  \u201cThe quality of the water has deteriorated. When objections were made public, authorities attempted to clean, but unfortunately the pool has gone back to its old ways. There is hardly any visibility while swimming and I honestly fear that I may hurt myself,\u201d said a top swimmer.  Having spent crores of rupees in developing infrastructure, the state government has been unable to provide swimmers with basic training facility.  \u201cI will not want myself or any other of the young swimmers to get hurt (by training at Peddem).

How will we perform at the Nationals if we don\u2019t know our timings? My parents told me I was going wayward.\u201d  But Arolkar also agreed that there was an issue with visibility.  \u201cIt is because of backwash. Due to heavy usage, a lot of dirt and waste gets collected. The plant treats it and 90% is filtered out. What remains, takes eight days to clean up. This issue is prevalent during the summer,\u201d he said.  On swimmers getting rashes and infection, Arolkar said, \u201cNot a single swimmer has come to me and shown the medical report. I have 450 swimmers including Navy personnel who train here. It is just a (small) set of people who are complaining.\u201d  The swimming pool at the Peddem sports complex was constructed in the early nineties, while the complex was renovated in 2013 ahead of the Lusofonia Games.  \u201cThere is a need for a new swimming pool here. The diving structure is dangerous and we have put up a board not to use it. With latest digital filtration technology available, we must upgrade,\u201d said an official, who asked not to be named.

The 1,000mW power that the state buys is adequate for domestic and commercial consumption, but chinks in the distribution network were responsible for the frequent power supply breakdown, Cabral told reporters. \u201cWe have a permanent solution for the people of South Goa by taking the entire load of Goa from the western power grid,\u201d said the minister, who has been taking a lot of flak over the last week for the frequent power outages in South Goa. Presently, North Goa is powered by electricity drawn from the western grid which is brought into the state through two 400kVA high tension lines are Colvale and two 220 kVA lines at Mahalakshmi and Tillari.

Taleigao comunidade had also demanded that the authorities clear the mud in the creek before the monsoon, as the heavily silted water way is prone to flooding during extreme weather events. The construction of a concrete wall on the edge of the reclamation, to fortify the embankment, was also in progress when the notice was issued.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Two members of the family\u2014father and son\u2014were killed and four seriously injured. Outraged by the incident, a 250-strong mob set the outstation vehicle on fire, demanding justice for the victims and blocked the bridge for four hours. Police said the incident occurred at 6.45am when the family was travelling in a car driven by Judas Fernandes, 25, with his father Joao Fernandes, 62, mother Milagrin Fernandes, 53, sister Cynthia Fernandes, 29, and friends Sonia Lobo, 22, and Alton Simoes, 24, from Morjim to attend Mass at St Anthony Church in Siolim. The accident took place in the middle of the Siolim-Chopdem bridge, about a kilometre from the celebrations at the Siolim church. The Maharashtra registered sports utility vehicle (SUV) with five occupants travelling from Calangute to Ashwem collided head-on with the car. The impact was such that the son was killed on the spot while the father died on the way to the North Goa district hospital where he was declared brough dead by doctors. Locals alleged the group from Maharashtra was under the influence of alcohol and driving in the wrong lane when they hit the Fernandes family. Milagrin and Alton were shifted to the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC). Police said their condition was serious till Sunday evening. Cynthia and Sonia are being treated at the North Goa district hospital at Peddem, Mapusa. The incident outraged locals who rushed to the site and blocked the road demanding action against the SUV occupants who fled the scene after the accident. The bridge which connects Siolim to Pernem taluka remained closed for four hours, paralysing traffic. Judas\u2019 body was lying alongside the bridge for four hours as locals refused to allow authorities to move it. They demanded that the culprits be given stringent punishment for their rash driving. The ill-fated vehicle was towed away at 11.15am. An hour after the accident, the situation escalated as 250-300 locals gathered at the site. The mob set the SUV on fire, demanding the culprits be arrested and brought to the site. A fire brigade was pressed into service to douse the car in flames.

Preliminary investigations suggest the occupants of the SUV are staff of a hospital in Mumbai,\u201d Dessai told TOI. All the occupants statements were recorded.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process.

A Goa-based company which collaborated with Percept Live Ltd, to organise a festival in February this year, has submitted a proposal to the tourism department seeking permission to organise Sunburn Klassique from December 27 to December 29 at Vagator in North Goa. Harindra Singh, managing partner at Percept Live Ltd, confirmed to TOI about the proposal but said goverment approval is awaited. Klassique\u2019s local partner, Shailesh Shetty, said they will proceed further after in-principle nod is received from the tourism department. Percept Live Ltd, which had EDM festivals in Goa for a decade, shifted to Pune in December 2016 after a standoff with the government over pending dues. The new players who jumped into the fray and organised festivals for two years pulled out. The December of 2018 saw no festival in the state. Some attributed the drop in footfalls that December to Goa having no big music event. Tourism stakeholders are of the opinion that the government\u2019s flip-flop stand on festivals was responsible for investors staying away. Trade body Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), requested the government several times not to keep event organisers hanging. Tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar has pledged support to music events or programmes that will increase the value of destination Goa, but there are yet to be any policy changes regarding this.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister said an active and effective opposition is a necessity in a democracy and pointed out that a well- argued and factual criticism of the government strengthens democracy. \"Sometimes such positive contributions are not noticed as they do not get high TRPs,\" he said. Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said. Referring to his recent speeches, the Prime Minister said that \"we started with ' sab ka saath, sab ka vikas', but the people have added an unprecedented 'vishwas' (trust) to the matter\". He said Monday marks the the start of the first session after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. \"I welcome all new MPs. With them comes new hope, new aspirations and new determination to serve,\" he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The revised norms, which are effective immediately, are designed to reduce the interaction between the TCP department and applicants, while also helping the state to increase its ease of doing business rankings, said officials. \u201cWe have brought in an enabling provision for online approvals using Auto-DCR. The software itself is being prepared, and will be rolled out soon,\u201d said chief town planner James Mathew. Auto-DCR is a software that automatically studies building plans by reading CAD drawings and checks if they meet TCP\u2019s development rules. TCP minister Vijai Sardesai had announced that the state had floated the tender for the Auto-DCR in September 2017. These draft norms were published in December 2018 for objections and suggestions, which were looked into by a steering committee. After the scrutiny and incorporation of valid suggestions, the government has now moved to notify the regulations. However, what is expected to bring relief to applicants and reduce TCP\u2019s workload is the move to permit registered architects or engineers to issue third party certifications for low-risk buildings for facilitating issuance of technical clearance, development permission, and completion order. \u201cThird party certification by professionals for low-risk buildings such as residential homes with one story in up to 500 sq m area is being permitted for promoting ease of doing business,\u201d Mathew said. He said that the government also wanted to simplify the process to start solar farms in the state by waiving the need for permissions for setting them up. Along with the construction of solar farms, an individual or company will also be allowed to set up up office space of a maximum of 200 sq m, the notification says. TCP has also taken into consideration the impact that malls or commercial complexes have on traffic movement and parking. The new regulations stipulate that a traffic impact study and a traffic management plan have to be in place before clearance is given for malls. Malls or entertainment complexes will be permitted in commercial zones and only next to 15m-wide roads. The norms also state that adequate parking should be available in such malls.

Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

This increase will be to accomodate the 10% quota for economically backward sections (EWS), recently approved by the state cabinet, based on a decision by the central government. The new seats are supernumerary, which means they are being added to accomodate the quota without touching the existing seats. As there are around 1,300 engineering seats on offer in Goa at present, the state will see 130 new seats added to various programmes in the five institutes in the state as part of the EWS quota. \u201cRIEIT in Shiroda has recieved the approval to introduce two new engineering programmes from the All India Council of Technical Education with a combined intake of 120,\u201d said a state official. \u201cThis will add another 12 seats to the EWS quota, once RIEIT gets affiliation for the new programmes from Goa University. Goa has two pharmacy colleges with 120 seats on offer and EWS quota seats of 12 will be added to them.\u201d The first round of admissions to professional degree programmes in Goa begins on June 17, with the engineering and pharmacy seats. \u201cThe 10% quota will be provided this year itself,\u201d said a state official from the directorate of technical education (DTE), which carries out admissions to the programmes. \u201cWe are awaiting a notification from the government to tell us who is the competant authority to issue the certificates certifying the students as EWS and what is the format of the certificate. Once the notification comes, we will begin admissions to the quota. It is good that the quota is supernumerary and does not disturb existing seats and other reservation quota distributions.\u201d Officials said that all admission rounds to professional degree courses in Goa, including to EWS, are expected to be completed by August 15. Goa Medical College has applied to the Medical Council of India to increase its seats from the current 150 to 200. The quota is expected to be accomodated within these 50 new seats for the medicine programme. Similarly, Goa Dental College, which has an intake of 40 at present, has asked the Dental Council of India for the addition of ten more seats to make place for the EWS quota seat students. \u201cAccordingly, the intake for the ayurveda, homeopathy, nursing programmes will see increase to make place for the 10% EWS quota seats. Altogether, 200 additional seats will be released for all professional courses in Goa,\u201d said the official. Supreme Court norms require that general category quota should at least account for 51% of the seats. In 2013, reservation quota for other backward classes (OBC) was increased from the earlier 19.5% to 27%.
