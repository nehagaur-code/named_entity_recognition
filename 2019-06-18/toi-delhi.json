The alleged attack on the AIIMS doctor comes against the backdrop of the medical fraternity holding protests all over the country in solidarity with the junior doctors in West Bengal, who were on a strike since last Tuesday after two of their colleagues were attacked allegedly by relatives of a patient who died at NRS Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. The incident took place around 11.30pm on Sunday, when a patient with a foot injury came for treatment, president of AIIMS Resident Doctor\u2019s Association (RDA) Dr Amarinder Singh Malhi said. \u201cThe patient was accompanied by his attendants. The doctor on duty was attending to a high-risk patient at that time, when the attendants asked him to attend to their patient on a priority basis. The doctor told them to wait for some time as the one he was attending to required immediate attention.

The resident doctors of AIIMS, at the forefront of the protests in Delhi, have decided not to take part in the protest call by the IMA.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Rajasthan Royals 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rajasthan-royals-team-2019-players-list-rr-team-2019/articleshow/67151472.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "\nSara Ali Khan promotes Kedarnath in Noida\n": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sara-ali-khan-promotes-kedarnath-in-noida/articleshow/66988989.cms", "time": "", "description": "A day before the release of Kedarnath - her debut film - actor Sara Ali Khan visited DLF Mall of India to promote the film.

The government informed Justice Najmi Waziri that till date only 3,500 saplings have been planted and another 2,500 would be planted by the end of the week. The court, thereafter, observed, \u201cI see a lot of recalcitrance at your (forest department) end.\u201d The move would bring the total to 6,000 as against the 30,000 saplings, which were to be planted in the first phase by June 15 according to the high court\u2019s May 30 order. The court further noted that the forest authority was \u201csitting pretty\u201d on it as if the lives of Delhiites did not matter. \u201cLook how hot it is in the city. Quit stalling and do it,\u201d the court said. The forest department had said that after the May 30 order, it had surveyed the Central Ridge for additional sites to plant the saplings and could identify only 2,500 more pockets. It added that watering of saplings in these pockets could only be done manually. Therefore, it sought permission to plant the remaining saplings in the Southern Ridge. The court, however, said that saplings could also be planted near existing trees where the top soil would be thicker or deeper. It directed the forest department to plant 5,000 more saplings in the Central Ridge and around 50,000 in the Southern Ridge. The state government has assured HC that its directions to plant 1.4 lakh saplings in the Central Ridge will be implemented. The government\u2019s stand came after the court warned of contempt action against forest department officials for non-compliance of its order.

After chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the scheme a fortnight ago, the AAP government has held a series of meetings with officials of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and the transport department. A final proposal may be submitted before the Delhi cabinet soon. Implementing the scheme in DTC and cluster buses is likely to be a straightforward proposition, but doing so in metro involves quite a few complications. \u201cThe cabinet\u2019s nod is sufficient for enforcing the plan in buses,\u201d a government source confirmed. According to DMRC, the free travel for women in metro will entail an annual expenditure of Rs 1,566.6 crore. It has submitted two proposals to the government in this regard: while one involves incorporating the changes in the DMRC software as well as smart cards, the other requires women to purchase special tokens at ticket windows or via vending machines. Both proposals may take eight to 12 months to be implemented, DMRC officials believe, meaning which a lot of ground has to be covered before the proposal even comes before the cabinet for clearance. Metro will need to set up a fare-fixation committee to consider the proposals, which will then be forwarded to the DMRC board. With assembly elections due early next year, the government is keen on pushing the scheme. Sources said government surveys to know people\u2019s views on the issue had thrown up encouraging results. Some AAP MLAs claimed that over 99% of the women they had interacted with in their respective assembly constituencies had given positive feedback on the proposal. According to the plan under consideration, women who wish to avail of free rides will need to buy tickets on the bus, but these will come for free. \u201cThe tickets will mention that the cost has been waived off by the Delhi government,\u201d a source said.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath. The Pro tem speaker ruled that the members stick to the format provided. After this, the members of BJP started adding 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' after end of every oath. Some of the prominent names who took oath from Madhya Pradesh included K P Yadav who defeated Jyotiraditya Scindia, Rakesh Singh, Ramakant Bhargava and Nakul Nath.

Verhaen Khanna, founder of New Delhi Nature Society, in an email to forest department officials and environment minister Imran Hussain, alleged, \u201cFertile soil is being cemented to make an outdoor gym. Please note that all other outdoor gyms in Delhi do not have a cemented ground.\u201d Sanjay Van is a city forest near Vasant Kunj and Mehrauli in south Delhi spread over 783 acres. \u201cToday I found new cementing work around the trees, which used to have soil and grassy area, inside Sanjay Van near Qutub Institutional Area gate. You are requested to urgently stop the illegal work, give directions for corrective measures to ensure only soil remains within one metre of the affected trees. Kindly follow the procedure under Section 8 of Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994,\u201d Khanna stated in the email. National Green Tribunal in its order dated April 23, 2013, said: \u201cThey (authorities) shall ensure that the concrete surrounding the trees within one metre is removed forthwith\u2026 due precaution is taken in future so that no concrete or construction or repairing work is done at least within one metre radius of the trunk of trees.\u201d Poonam Dewan, DDA additional commissioner (landscape), told TOI: \u201cNormally, directions are given that no concretisation will be done around trees.

The roots of trees are destroyed because they get little space to grow and anchor the tree. Interestingly, Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, also had provisions for penal action against those who trap trees in concrete. In 2000, the central government issued rules for de-choking of trees, which states that an area of 6x6 feet around each tree should be left vacant while concretising pavements. In 2007, Delhi high court, while hearing a petition filed by NGO Kalpvriksha, directed the authorities to free the trees in the city of concrete. Two years later, the court, while hearing a petition filed by SC Jain, ordered a survey in Delhi on the status and plans for de-concretisation.

Defined as a plan for a ward or a sub-zone of the city, it was meant to be an enabler for a fourth level of planning \u2014 after the master, zonal and layout plans \u2014 which empowered the local bodies to make and implement improvements in the local area, particularly in each ward and sub-zone or colony with participation of residents and their RWAs. But during the past 12 years, very little has been done either RWAs or the three corporations for implementing improvements using the LAP planning tool. Creating proper pedestrian pathways connecting local shopping centres within colonies is one such need. As old, single-family homes are rapidly giving way to stilt-plusfour floors \u2014 a practice which became popular after the stilt parking concept was allowed in this master plan \u2014 traffic and on-street parking issues have begun to plague most Delhi colonies. There is now a need to rework the pedestrian walkways within the colony, recreate cycle tracks and find ways to eliminate the conflict between people and vehicles. Even within the local shopping centres and colony markets, increasing pedestrian space is now more important than ever before. Attempts made by the municipal bodies and councillors to improve the pedestrian\u2019s experience have been limited to using concrete pavers and planters. Very little work has been done on the drawing board to achieve proper pedestrianisation. Lessons can be drawn from the Connaught Place experiment (post construction of the Delhi Metro station at Rajiv Chowk that replaced the old central lawn of CP). The municipal body increased the area meant for pedestrian traffic in the inner ring around the CP shopping area, introduced better planned parking spaces, increased the green cover with hardy trees and bushes and segregated the walking areas from vehicular traffic spaces with green cover and bollards. Elsewhere \u2013 particularly on the roads leading to the shopping areas \u2014 the pedestrian pathways were segregated from the road tops with hardy hedges fed with drip irrigation and table-top speed breakers to slow down the vehicular traffic. Learnings from the CP experience were then used in other markets like Khan Market, Bengali Market and Malcha Market. In some shopping districts, the open pathways in front of the shops were widened to give way to more pedestrian walkways and seating in stone and steel were added. But somehow the CP experience was not replicated by the three municipal corporations which administer a large area of Delhi \u2014 not many MCD markets have looked at pedestrianisation the way NDMC did \u2014 both within the market areas and on the roads leading to them. While this is indeed a pity \u2014 especially in a city which has a pleasant weather for seven months \u2014 there is still time to implement the LAP system. Action must start now before our colonies end up like Karol Bagh. It is time we looked at pedestrianisation and connectivity in the wards and colonies seriously. The last-mile connectivity provided by the now popular e-rickshaws also needs to be incorporated in LAP. The LAP process has, perhaps, been ignored because the three municipal bodies lack professional in-house capacity to engage with the stakeholder residents, draw up plans, discuss them with RWAs, seek and get consensus and take the all other steps which LAP mandated in MPD 2021 . LAP is a participatory process and cannot succeed without the involvement of residents. It needs ideas, discussing them in depth in stakeholder consultations, making detailed drawings and illustrating them with examples on the ground. This is not a new planning tool. It existed in Europe and UK around a century ago when it was realised that a democratic and participatory approach to the local area\u2019s planning needs are the only way forward to satisfying the needs and aspirations of the community.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

DCP (Rohini) SD Mishra said that a case under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) has been registered. A preliminary investigation has revealed that the unidentified victim, who was in his early 20s, was caught by a shop owner, Amit, on Saturday evening. Amit told police that he runs a mobile phone shop on the main Mubarakpur Road in Prem Nagar. Last month, the victim had stolen a phone and the DVR of a CCTV camera from his shop. Amit later managed to get the footage showing the man stealing the items. Around 7pm on Saturday, when the victim was allegedly peeping into the shop with another associate, Amit chased them. He caught the men with the help of his neighbours and brought them to his shop where they were thrashed by the shopkeepers and the public. Later, the shopkeepers decided to let one of them leave. They detained the victim hoping that his family would come and pay for the stolen mobile phone. However, the victim fell unconscious and was rushed to a hospital where he was declared brought dead. The PCR was subsequently informed about the incident. A team inspected the scene of crime and recorded the statements of eyewitnesses. The CCTV footage of the area is being scanned. Efforts are being made to identify the victim. His body has been preserved in the mortuary and an autopsy will be conducted to determine the exact cause of death.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

A majority of these are CGHS societies in Dwarka that were provided solar panels last year under the \u2018Solar City Initiative - Solarise Dwarka\u2019 scheme by BSES in collaboration with TERI and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ India) under the Indo-German solar partnership project. Initially, seven societies were chosen for the project and they reported cumulative savings of 6.5 lakh electricity units and Rs 32 lakh annually. This model has proved attractive for others and more societies are joining in to avail long-term benefits. \u201cSolar panels with a capacity of 100kW were installed in our society last April. There are about 60 dwelling units here. The surplus power generated is sent back to the grid. Annually, over 1 lakh units are being saved and they are adjusted against our bills. After seeing the reduction in bills, other societies have also installed solar panels,\u201d said KR Anand from Shiv Bhole CGHS society in Sector 7, Dwarka. Kalka CGHS in Sector 6, Dwarka has a similar tale to tell with Rs 2 per unit being saved by each household. \u201cAt present, the solar capacity is 50kW. If the requirement is of 200 units and we produce 220 units, we receive surplus benefits of Rs 5 per unit,\u201d said SS Rawat, president of the housing society. Rawat said a feasibility test was carried out by the discom last year to ascertain the rooftop potential. \u201cAfter calculating the average of the bills in the society, they informed us that 50kW would be sufficient and we installed that capacity,\u201d he added. Kamal Vihar CGHS in Sector 7, where the installed solar capacity is 200kW, has been reaping the most benefits. BSES said the annual savings there are Rs 18.52 lakh in cash and over 2.5 lakh electricity units. Joy Apartments in Sector 2, meanwhile, has a capacity of 120kW and annual savings of Rs 11.11 lakh. \u201cThe network has slowly been expanding and now more societies want to install the solar panels.

A decade later, however, the facility, modelled on similar facilities in the West, has not lived up to its expectations. An official from the tourism department said that since the number of riders has reduced, the number of buses have also come down. According to them, around 30 buses will be introduced initially for the new service and more will be launched later depending on the response.

Users will be able to benefit from a single solar plant at one location with the surplus energy being sent back to the grid and adjusted with the bill of each meter connected to it. This will, in theory, allow members of a society and consumers to reduce their monthly bills. After the Delhi solar policy was issued in 2016, the power watchdog had constituted a committee for developing this framework and issued draft guidelines under DERC (Net Metering for Renewable Energy) Regulations, 2014 last year. The framework has finally been notified after objections and comments were collected from the general public by January 2019. \u201cThe move will help in the promotion and deployment of renewable energy projects in residential and agricultural sectors benefitting lakhs of citizens and farmers. At present, we have about 630 net metering connections and this number will shoot up once we implement the order. We are in the process of making changes in the billing mechanism to implement it,\u201d said a Tata Power-DDL spokesperson. BSES said consumers can apply for net metering on their website. \u201cWe had earlier launched a Solar City Initiative to bridge the gap between the consumer and the vendor. Post-installation, BSES will carry out an inspection to assess the quality and check whether it has been done according to the minimum technical requirements,\u201d said a BSES official. At present, Tata Power has around 630 net-metered connections with a capacity of 25 MW, while BSES has 1,600 with a capacity of 60 MW. According to BSES, a 100kW plant can save up to 1,27,750 units annually equalling annual savings of Rs 9.26 lakh. A 5KW plant can bring annual savings of Rs 46,300. The discoms said that to apply for the project, people can simply contact them after which a feasibility test would be carried out and bills assessed to find out the requirement for a household or colony. \u201cDepending on the consumption and the bill amount, we will be able to decide on the solar panel capacity. Different CGHS societies are thriving with solar panels capacities ranging from 50kW to 200kW,\u201d said a BSES official. Vendors said the amount invested in a solar panel can be recovered in the form of savings in just 5-6 years. \u201cThis is a safe estimate and the actual invested amount is recovered in close to four years. There are immense benefits to go solar as the product is a long-term investment,\u201d said Abhishek Dabas, co-founder at Zolt Energy, a private solar-panel supplying company. Sanjeev Aggarwal, MD and CEO of Amplus Solar, said the risk in investment is generally low and savings can be as high as 90% of the total bill, depending on the plant size and consumption pattern. \u201cOn average, a 5kWp standard rooftop installation will cost Rs 3-4 lakh. If one opts for subsidy, they can avail 30% of the plant cost from MNRE through the state nodal agency,\u201d he added. However, Pujarini Sen, a campaigner at Greenpeace India, said the notification process has taken far too long to allow people to avail subsidies for solar plants. \u201cThe important thing now is to make the consumers aware about it and facilitate it, especially at the residential level. Once popular, the load on the grid and electricity bills will reduce, benefitting both the consumer and the discoms,\u201d she added.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

One of the gang members, identified as Ravi Kumar, a resident of Budh Vihar, was arrested last week. Two other gang members are absconding, he said. The gang was trying to extort Rs 30,000 from a resident of affluent Greater Kailash area and almost succeed in doing so by posing as BSES enforcement officials, he added. The gang members had approached a Greater Kailash II resident and owner of an under construction house in the area's S Block, the spokesperson said. \"They almost managed to convince the resident that he was misusing the electricity connection and would have to pay a penalty of Rs 1,25,000. When the consumer was seemingly convinced, the gang offered to settle the matter for an amount for Rs 30,000,\" he said. The man was called to the Andrews Ganj bus stop, which is close to the BSES' enforcement office. Suspecting fraud, he contacted his business partner and subsequently informed the discom, which clarified that these people were \"imposters\". A team of senior BSES officials, with the help of the consumer, set up a trap. As had been decided earlier, the consumer met the gang members and paid Rs 30,000. Kumar was nabbed by the BSES officials and the police personnel, he said, adding that his two accomplices, who were on a motorcycle, managed to flee. An FIR has been registered at the Defence Colony police station in this connection, the spokesperson said.

Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The company alleged that the gang behind the con job has duped several people by posing as their representatives. The fraudsters are not only running portals with a similar domain name as that of the company, but have also opened bank accounts to cheat people. The gang has been taking money from people by promising to install telecom towers on their property for a good rental income. After trapping their victims, the gang demands money for processing fee, registration charges and security deposits. According to police souces, the company, ATC India, got an FIR registered after discovering the large-scale fraud happening in their name. ATC India provides infrastructure to all major telecom firms in the country by providing, renting and installing mobile towers, antenna systems and other backup services. \u201cThese people have forged the company\u2019s letterheads, stationary and have registered domain names that are deceptively similar to ours. They have also opened bank accounts, which are being used to solicit money from people,\u201d the company said in its complaint to the police. A preliminary investigation revealed that two websites \u2014 www.atcindiatower.in and www.atcindiatower.in.net \u2014 are in operation and have no relation with the actual company. While one of them is registered to an office at Barakhamba Road, the other has its registration in United Arab Emirates. When accessed, the fake websites even displayed toll free numbers along with a series of mobile phone numbers to take inquiries. Delhi Police have registered an FIR under IPC sections of fraud and impersonation. Apart from these, sections of the Copyright Act and Information Technology Act have also been applied. Cops are tracking the cellphone numbers that have been advertised by the gang and have sought the IP addresses of the fake websites.

Hundreds of patients were affected by it. Safdarjung, Lok Nayak and Guru Tegh Bahadur hospitals were among the worst affected. At RML and AIIMS, senior faculty members could be seen manning the OPDs and also making an extra effort to run the in-patient wards smoothly. \u201cThe doctor is only seeing those women who are nine months\u2019 pregnant or have an emergency,\u201d said Rashida who came from Faridabad for an appointment with a gynaecologist at Safdarjung Hospita. There are was a long queue of patients outside the few functioning OPDs at the hospital, which gets about 8,000 patients daily. \u201cWe have been waiting here for the past three hours,\u201d said Mukesh Singh, who had come with his wife for a check-up. At AIIMS also, the OPDs were functioning only partially. Rohil came with his mother from Meerut. She suffered a leg fracture. \u201cThe OPD started at 10.30am instead of 9am due to the strike. They are not issuing new OPD receipts, just issuing follow-up receipts,\u201d he said. Rai Prakash said he will have to come to Delhi again on June 26 as he couldn\u2019t get an MRI done on Monday. The story was similar at Kalawati Saran Children\u2019s Hospital and RML hospital. At RML, the OPD area was crowded and partly operational. Nishit came from Chhattisgarh with a hairline fracture. \u201cI don\u2019t see much difference. The patients are still being treated even though the queues are long,\u201d he said. A senior doctor at Lok Nayak hospital said nearly 80 non-emergency surgeries had to be cancelled due to the strike. Even some private hospitals and nursing homes suffered. Later in the day, Dr Girish Tyagi, president of Delhi Medical Association, announced the end of the strike due to the West Bengal CM agreeing to the demands of junior doctors. \u201cHealth services will work normally from Tuesday,\u201d he said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Overflowing trash": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/overflowingtrash/articleshow/69821444.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Encroachment in public park": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/encroachmentinpublicpark/articleshow/69821395.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Watch: SAD MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa manhandled by protestors in auto driver assault case": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//videos/city/delhi/watch-sad-mla-manjinder-singh-sirsa-manhandled-by-protestors-in-auto-driver-assault-case/videoshow/69836015.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Six years after NGT order, PWD drive to free trees of concrete bases": {"description": "NEW DELHI: The public works department (PWD) has finally initiated a drive to break concrete bases around the trees along its footpaths so that roots can access water, soil and air. The drive follows a 2013 order by National Green Tribunal (NGT) asking Delhi\u2019s civic agencies to leave a one-metre radius around trees. Any agency failing to comply with it will be fined Rs 10,000 per tree. The work has already started at New Friends Colony and a senior official said PWD would undertake the drive in its areas across the capital. The agency will try to finish it at the earliest, if possible before the monsoon, the official added. The land-owning agency has also came on board and said it would remove the concrete in its areas in a few days. The concretisation up to the trunk of a tree makes its foundation weak as there is no space for them to absorb air and water. Its roots get destroyed as they get little space to grow and anchor the tree. Verhaen Khanna, founder of New Delhi Nature Society, said the agencies had been working as per the order and people should allow them to function freely. \u201cWe should realise that it\u2019s for the betterment of the environment and to prevent more trees from falling in adverse situations,\u201d he added. In 2007, while hearing a petition by NGO Kalpvriksha, Delhi high court had directed the authorities to free the trees of concrete. Two years later, the court, while hearing another petition by activist S C Jain, had ordered a survey on the status and plans for deconcretisation. The green tribunal had said on April 23, 2013, \u201cDue precaution (should be) taken in future so that no concrete or construction or repair work is done at least within one metre radius of the trunk of trees.\u201d Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, has penal provisions for any such concretisation.

A senior north corporation official said a sensitisation meeting with local traders was held on Friday with the focus on identifying locations where the additional vehicle parking load could be shifted. The corporation plans to conduct a detailed survey of the area before implementing the project. The survey is aimed at understanding the ground situation, such as the available parking space, tentative number of vehicles parked on the roads, street parking available, the kind and amount of encroachments, the number of roads to be pedestrianised and arrangements that could be made for animal-powered vehicles, the official said. The move comes after the corporation successfully pedestrianised Ajmal Khan Road in Karol Bagh and regularised parking and traffic movement there. It also hiked on-street parking rates to discourage private cars and is currently carrying out work for improving the parking condition on connecting roads. \u201cSince the nature of Sadar Bazar market is different from Karol Bagh, we need to understand the ground situation before preparing any plan. We may need to shift unauthorised vending from the area, but everything will be done after a consensus with the market associations and shopkeepers,\u201d the official said. But the marking and lane division on the 600m stretch \u2014 from Sadar Thana to Bara Tooti Chowk \u2014 will be carried out on similar lines and traffic restrictions are expected to be in place for a month and a half. So far, the civic body has identified two locations as alternative parking space. \u201cWe can use the nearby Idgah area that used to house the slaughterhouse earlier. It can cater to around 700 vehicles. We also have the option of using a plot of the old zonal municipal corporation office, which can accommodate another 80 vehicles,\u201d he said. At its house meeting last month, the civic agency had approved a \u201cmanagement plan\u201d for busy markets, such as Sadar Bazar and Kamla Nagar, which entailed decongesting these shopping hubs and increasing on-street parking charges. The project for decongestion and pedestrainising Sadar Bazar was taken up on the request of the market association there. Devraj Baweja, general secretary of Confederation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association, said haphazard parking and traffic jams were major problems. \u201cA decongestion plan on the lines of Karol Bagh is required in the area.

We have got positive response from the market association here.\u201d As a part of the project, the street will be marked with yellow and white stripes, demarcating space for hawkers and non-mortised vehicles.

The university is amending the criteria following orders from Delhi high court. A student had moved court over the additional eligibility criteria introduced for BA (Hons) Economics and BCom (Hons). On Friday, HC asked the university to return to the old eligibility criteria in these two courses and extend the registration process till June 22. Earlier, the last day for registration was June 14. Under the new criteria, the university had made inclusion of mathematics compulsory in the calculation of the best-of-four for BCom (Hons). Also, an applicant was required to have scored 50% or more in mathematics to be eligible. Till last year, even pass marks in the subject would have sufficed. The additional eligibility criteria was introduced for a host of other subjects. The new requirements included a minimum of 55% in English and Hindi for English (Hons) and Hindi (Hons), respectively. Till last year, there was no such requirement. Even for language courses, such as Persian, Urdu, Arabic (Hons) and BA programme, DU had introduced a rider of 40% in either Class X or XII in these subjects. \u201cThe admission committee has been told to look into all criteria that are going to disadvantage students. It\u2019s likely that the additional eligibility requirements may be done away in all cases,\u201d a senior university official, on condition of anonymity, said. Quashing the amendment, a bench of Justices Anu Malhotra and Talwant Singh had said, \u201cThere is no dispute that you (DU) have to be in tune with the times. Nothing prevents you from improving the education standards. No one is saying that your decision is not right, but your timing may not be right.\u201d DU can carry out any amendment in the eligibility criteria by giving a six-month notice before the admissions, it added. However, the changes relating to lowering of percentage deduction for change in streams from 2.5% to 1% will stay. The HC ruling has come as a shot in the arm for several students. Varun Jatav, who wanted to pursue Hindi (Hons), said: \u201cI had 54% marks in Hindi in my Class XII boards. Due to the new rules that were introduced, I was not able to fill up the form.\u201d Jatav, who hails from Haryana, said his best-of-four came to 85%. The changes effected by DU had come on the recommendation of committees in the respective departments. According to the rules, these suggestions have to be ratified by the standing committee and the academic as well as executive councils after which they are notified. But, generally, once the standing committee approves the changes, these are approved by the vice-chancellor. At the statutory body meetings, these changes are listed as reporting items. Hence, this year, even before the matter reached the court, the EC members had written to VC, asking him to withdraw these criteria, as they did not have appropriate approvals. Now, as the university is taking a relook at these changes, the admission schedule has gone haywire \u2014 right from releasing cutoffs to the trial schedule for sports and extra-curricular activities.

Many of these names are suspected to be behind numerous recent cases of gang war, carjacking and extortion. Murder, attempt to murder and extortion are among the 16 cases that Lagarpuria has against his name. He was arrested in 2015 and was in Bhondsi jail till December last year. Police officers said he applied for parole, citing the ill-health of a family member but, once out, he never went back. His close aide, Anil Ganja, also gave cops the slip after coming out on parole. It is suspected that the two are recruiting new members to their gang. Ganja, too, has six cases registered against him. After Lagarpuria was arrested, Ganja started his own gang, but is learnt to have joined hands with him again. Police sources said there had been a spike in carjacking incidents in and around Dwarka and Najafgarh ever since the two men came out of jail. Cops are also on the lookout for Amit Guliya, a close aide of gangster Kapil Sangwan, alias Nandu.

Resident Doctors&apos Association, AIIMS take out a protest march against assault on medicos. #DoctorsStrike #AIIMS\u2026 https://t.co/B7IKivZms4&mdash; TOI Delhi (@TOIDelhi) 1560746251000Emergency services including Casualty, ICU and Labour room services will however not be affected. The decision by AIIMS doctors was taken in an emergency meeting early today and comes amid allegations that a junior resident doctor at the Emergency Department of Jai Prakash Narain Apex Trauma Centre (JPNATC) at AIIMS, Delhi was abused by the relatives of a patient at around 1:30 am on Sunday for \"performing his rightful duty of giving preferential care to a critical patient.\" \"We remain dedicated to the primary reason of serving humanity to our fullest potential. The incident at Emergency Department, Trauma Centre, AIIMS where a junior resident was assaulted for performing his rightful duty of giving preferential care to a critical patient, was efficiently managed with the support of AIIMS administration in letter and spirit,\" the RDA said. \"But this event made us rethink about the warfront like conditions faced by our fellow medicos elsewhere, where they are usually left alone to fight for their lives while saving those of the sick and even where the basic security measures like CCTV surveillance and special security deployment at Emergency and ICU's are nonexistent,\" the RDA statement added. Th association said it has decided to continue active association with the \"movement to ensure safety and security of doctors is essential for it to materialize into legal concrete results of bringing a 'Central Act for Violence against Doctors' by the Government of India, which includes invoking stringent penal actions against the culprits.\" The association has further urged the West Bengal administration to fulfill the demands of striking doctors and resolve the matter amicably at the earliest. Protesting junior doctors in West Bengal sought an \"immediate end to this impasse\" and agreed for talks with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. On Saturday, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had accepted the protesting doctors' demands and promised to not invoke the stringent Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) against them for not performing their duties and urged them to resume work immediately. Indian Medical Association (IMA), country's largest medical body is holding a nationwide strike today against the alleged attacks on doctors in West Bengal. It has urged for the formulation of a comprehensive law for the enactment of protection law for the doctors and amendment in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). It also wants security measures to be specified. The doctors' strike in West Bengal has entered its seventh day today and has spread to other parts of the country too. The doctors at AIIMS also took out a protest on the campus this morning. Meanwhile, doctors at Jaipuria Hospital in Jaipur are also on strike today. Doctors at Sir Sayajirao General Hospital in Vadodara hold protest outside Out Patient Department today.

But of course, the latter is the privilege of only a few. In Delhi University alone, of the 65,000 that it will admit this year for undergraduate studies, over half of them outstation aspirants, only 4,331 will get hostel seats. This is true also of the other universities and institutions in the city. Traditionally, paying guest hubs have met the accommodation needs of so many students. These days, however, it is not just a roof over the head that students demand. PGs are a necessity, of course, but potential dwellers also consider factors like safety in the locality, CCTVs, fire safety of the building and distance from their institutions in addition to rent, food and cleanliness. Secondary facilities sought include laundry, housekeeping services and WiFi connectivity. That is why many companies have corporatised student accommodation \u2014 and they are doing well too. In the south, the major PG areas are in Lajpat Nagar, Greater Kailash and Anand, while Vijay Nagar, Mukherjee Nagar and Guru Teg Bahadur Nagar in north Delhi have been the traditional posts for outstation students. The PG business has grown substantially in the past five years. Local property owners and dealers have taken full advantage of the shortage of accommodation in college campuses, and the outstation students find it comforting to find so many options available. Start-ups in the business prove how lucrative putting a roof over students\u2019 heads can be. Companies like CoHo, Stanza Living and Students Inn, among others, are drawing students with their \u201cconsumer-centric\u201d approach. Backed by sponsors such as the Matrix Partners, Accel Partners, Alteria Capital, they provide more than just a room-and-three-meals package. Gaming rooms with pool tables and gyms are among the additional facilities they offer. \u201cI enjoy my stay here,\u201d testified Anish Goyal, 23, who has opted for Stanza Living in Shakti Nagar in north Delhi while preparing for the judicial services exam. \u201cI have access to a gym, TV and a fusball table, among other things. I don\u2019t study all day long and these things help me relax.\u201d Even those in the older mould offer more than just the regular room and board. Sushila Rani has thrown in free WiFi for girls at her facility in Lajpat Nagar, charging them Rs 15,000-17,000 overall per month. \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to take good care of the girls living with us and we ensure facilities that satisfy them,\u201d said Rani. Priya Yadav, who lodges in the South Delhi Polytechnic for Women in the same locality, conceded, \u201cThe PG experience has been good. Our landlords have even provided us with coolers for the summer months.\u201d Madhu Sanhotra, warden of Divine Shelter in Vijay Nagar, claimed, \u201cThe girls have always felt safe and secure like they would at home. We have a security guard present at all times.\u201d Another facility there, North Campus Girls PG, not only has WiFi but also a doctor on call at reasonable rents ranging from Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000. The sealing drive has caused a small dent in the business, mainly because coaching institutions operating out of unauthorised buildings have closed shop. \u201cFewer students have turned up seeking accommodation this year. We have definitely faced losses in the past year,\u201d claimed a cafe owner in GTB Nagar, who offers rooms to students. Places like GTB Nagar and Kamla Nagar have been hit. In south Delhi, the regular PGs have also suffered, but for another reason. \u201cNew PGs have come up in Zamrudpur and Greater Kailash, closer to the institutions or to Delhi Metro stations. They are preferred by students,\u201d explained Nitin Sikka of Chowdhary Properties.

Analysis of the video footage of the incident by senior officers has revealed that the basic protocols of policing were violated. Most of it is due to poor training. Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar clash: What followed after video went viralSome officers said the moment a plainclothesman had overpowered Sarabjeet Singh, others should have helped to handcuff him. That didn\u2019t happen and Singh was not disarmed. 3 cops suspended after clash with tempo driver in Delhi's Mukherjee NagarAnyone familiar with American TV shows or Hollywood movies will know how police forces in the US tackle suspects: they are asked to put their hands behind their backs so that they can handcuffed, and the Miranda Rights are read out to them (where a policeman says, \u201cYou have the right to remain silent.\u201d). If the suspect is violent, Tasers or stun guns are used to shock him into submission. Cops clash with mini-bus driver in north Delhi's Mukherjee NagarContrast this with the approach of Delhi Police and one realises that the learning curve is quite steep for the police force. The right kind of equipment is also not there with the police. Situations such as this require non-lethal riot gear. In 2015, Delhi Police had planned to procure Tasers. These are weapons that deliver electric shocks to disrupt the voluntary control of muscles. A few demonstrators had been procured as well, but nothing moved beyond that. A senior officer opined that Singh shouldn\u2019t have been attacked with a pistol butt or sticks after he was pinned down. \u201cThe policemen should have used a vehicle to contain him and his son instead of carrying them by their limbs,\u201d he added. Hitting someone with a pistol butt is also very risky as the gun could go off accidentally if it\u2019s cocked. \u201cForce is used to take a suspect into custody. Excessive use of force after capture is unprofessional. The way the policemen were trying to catch the suspect and beating him without disarming him shows that they are unequipped for close combat,\u201d the officer said. Another retired officer said policemen these days often get carried away while countering attacks and involve themselves in fights instead of trying to control or subdue the subjects. On Sunday as well, the constables who had tried to restrain Singh and his son had started attacking them with a vengeance after they saw him hit a senior officer with a sword. \u201cThe objective was to pin him down and take him to the police station. Instead, they got busy hitting him which was unprofessional,\u201d said another officer. The police were also slammed for carrying Singh away by his limbs. As per protocol, even if a suspect is restrained right outside the police station, it is imperative for the police to use a vehicle to contain him and drive him in.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

As his popularity grew, so did the demand to upload more content. Nagar, who works in the call centre of a popular restaurant, needed a new phone for this, but didn\u2019t have the required funds. Instead of saving money, the youth came up with a trick. He searched for the phone he wanted on websites selling second-hand goods. He created a profile, chose a phone and contacted the seller. On June 12, the seller, Jatin Chhabra, came with his iPhone to meet Nagar at the mutually decided meeting point near Preet Vihar. However, instead of making the payment, Nagar snatched the phone from Chhabra and sped away on his motorcycle. A case was subsequently registered at Preet Vihar police station. DCP (east) Jasmeet Singh said that information about the snatching was relayed to all units. On Saturday, Nagar was spotted on Vikas Marg on his KTM bike, chased and nabbed by the cops. The snatched mobile phone was recovered from him. During interrogation, he told police that he was in need of an iPhone to make better videos, so he decided to snatch one.

When the ERV incharge, ASI Devender, confronted the man, he stepped out brandishing a sword. Singh said he was abused by the cops. Things turned ugly when the cops tried to disarm him. Singh said the cops had allegedly threatened him with a pistol, due to which he became agitated. \u201cMy son was in our vehicle and he too was threatened. I had reacted to this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were intimidating me with the pistol and sticks due to which I had pulled out the sword to defend myself and my son. I have identified and named a few policemen in my complaint,\u201d Singh said. A video shows at least a dozen cops trying to pin the man down, while he tries to attack them with the sword. During this, ASI Yograj, who was in civil clothes, grabbed Singh from behind but he managed to free himself and attacked him with the weapon. Despite being injured, Yograj held on to the man. The other cops, meanwhile, kept hitting Singh with sticks while his 16-year-old son tried to free him from them. In the scuffle, Singh and his son were hit son several times with sticks and pistol butts. The cops also landed a few kicks on Singh\u2019s head. Suddenly, his son is seen in the video driving the Gramin Sewa vehicle into the group of cops due to which two policemen got injured. ASI Yograj, whom Singh hit with a sword, claimed that the man instigated his son to attack the cops when they pinned him down. \u201cI tried to grab him from behind as he started charging at other policemen. I managed to control his arms but his son came and started slapping me. Later, he tried to ram us with his vehicle. As my grip loosened, the man swung the sword at me. It hit my legs and then struck my head,\u201d Yograj said. Some of the cops then got hold of the teenager and thrashed him, after which both Singh and his son were held by their hands and legs and carried to the police station, where they were detained.

The protests turned violent around 10pm as the mob started smashing the glass panes of police and private vehicles parked outside the police station. When teams led by ACP Shalimar Bagh, K G Tyagi, and other senior officers tried to contain them, the mob turned its fury on the cops. At least a dozen vehicles were damaged.

AAP could not win any of the seven parliamentary constituencies. It remained far behind Congress, while BJP won all seven seats by amassing a massive 56.5% vote share. Congress got 22.5% votes, while AAP managed to get only 18.1%. So far, 50 such meetings have taken place. A few of them have been chaired by Delhi convener Gopal Rai, MP Sanjay Singh, senior leaders Atishi Marlena, Raghav Chadha and Dilip Pandey. The focus is on figuring out the critical areas where the party needs to focus on to turn around the situation. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has asked party functionaries to work hard for the upcoming polls. A party functionary said senior leaders have been asked to address volunteer meetings in all assembly constituencies to strengthen the party\u2019s position. Atishi, who has addressed meetings in Kondli, Vishwas Nagar and other assembly segments in east Delhi, said: \u201cWe are a volunteer-driven party and after every election we sit with our volunteers to understand the results. We have tried to identify our weaknesses and discussed how our performance can be improved in the assembly polls.\u201d The party\u2019s performance in the Lok Sabha polls was far below expectations. AAP was at third position in 48 of the 70 assembly constituencies. In a bid to assuage the concerns of party workers, AAP leaders emphasised that the party didn\u2019t get much votes because it was a \u201cbig election\u201d between Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi prompting people to vote accordingly. People will vote for AAP in the \u201csmall election\u201d (assembly polls), they claimed. An AAP leader privy to the findings of the meetings claimed that the bad results in the parliamentary election have not taken a heavy toll on the enthusiasm of party workers. \u201cThe workers are not surprised by the outcome of Lok Sabha election. Functionaries at the assembly level shared that voters confided in them that they didn\u2019t vote for AAP in LS polls because it was a different election,\u201d the party leader added. He further claimed, quoting party functionaries, that during campaigning on the ground people told them, \u201cIss election mein maaf kar do, Dilli mein Kejriwal ko hi denge (Leave us during this election. For Delhi, we will vote for Kejriwal).\u201d The meetings are also being used as platforms to know public grievances so that the party can focus on critical issues.

The incident resulted into an uproar after the video clippings of the incident went viral on social media drawing reactions from Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari and several other politicians. Describing it as a shameful incident, the Punjab CM tweeted, \"Shameful incident of Delhi Police ruthlessly beating up Sarabjeet Singh and Balwant Singh over a petty issue.

Kejriwal visited the residence of Sarabjeet Singh and heard about the ordeal of the driver. \"The manner in which the driver was beaten was most brutal and barbaric. I condemn this assault by Delhi Police personnel in the strongest possible words. I appeal to LG, DCP and the police commissioner that the policemen responsible for the attack be punished severely. No citizen should have to go through this at the hands of the police,\" Kejriwal stated. A delegation of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee led by its president and BJP MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa called upon police commissioner Amulya Patnaik to seek action against the cops. Sarbjeet Singh was also part of the delegation. \"CP has assured that no guilty will be spared. An inquiry into the incident will be conducted by joint commissioner of police and the act of everyone involved in the incident will be identified,\" Sirsa stated. As the incident sparked protests on Sunday night, a group of AAP MLAs led by AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh also joined the protest outside the police station and termed the suspension of the three police personnel insufficient. Sirsa and officials of DSGMC were also among a large number of Sikhs who protested against the incident on Sunday night. Meanwhile, Kejriwal also tried to draw the attention of the LG and Union home minister towards the rising rate of crime in the city. \u201cThe LG and the home minister will have to be very strict about the rising rate of crime in Delhi.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

The submission was made before Justice Najmi Waziri, who, thereafter, disposed of the plea moved on behalf of the rape victim seeking permission to medically terminate her pregnancy. The high court had, on June 14, asked the AIIMS to set up a medical board to examine whether it was necessary to end the pregnancy of the 14-year-old rape victim and to carry out the procedure expeditiously, if required.
