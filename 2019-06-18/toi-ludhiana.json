He explains the shift in voting patterns in the recently concluded Lok Sabha polls. Your margin came down very drastically this time even as Jalandhar has traditionally been a safe seat for the Congress. What happened?It happened due to religious polarization this time. It never happened earlier in Punjab, especially in Doaba region. BJP this time succeeded in polarizing the voters this time and it is not a good sign for the state or the country. Then PDA aligning with left parties and BSP also caused some damage to us but we shall overcome this loss in assembly polls. There were certain local issues too. Did you lose your traditional core vote base in urban areas this time ?We suffered loss of our core vote base in urban areas due to polarization. Earlier, we used to do better in urban areas as compared to rural areas but for the first time the trend was reversed. Luckily, a significant chunk of Sikh voters turned to us this time with issue of sacrilege and police firing at Nakodar in 1986 weighing heavily on their minds. I raised issue of Nakodar firing in most of my election speeches and now after winning I shall pursue this issue for justice. Panthic constituency Shahkot gave us the biggest lead and played crucial role in victory. Dalits turned towards BSP in Doaba region in a major way. How do you explain this phenomena? Even as the Congress managed to retain its base among Dalit voters, a chunk of them went to BSP as issue of postmatric scholarship was working on their minds. In fact, BSP caused more damage to SAD-BJP, but some damage was caused to us too. Pending promotions of scheduled caste employees in government jobs was also a factor. Dalit sentiment was strong this time and BSP managed to exploit it and targeted the Congress through false propaganda even as we fought for the SCs. BSP created a false impression that it fought for rights of SCs even as theirs was more rhetoric than fighting it at institutional level. What will be your agenda for Jalandhar constituency?I shall pursue the projects already in pipeline. I shall try for upgradation of Adampur domestic airport to international airport and beginning of cargo flights so that farmers here can opt for diversification and their produces can be sent abroad. I will also try to bring industrial cluster here especially the heavy industry. We also need an AIIMS-like medical centre here to cater to entire Doaba. I will urge the state government to increase spending on education and fill up the vacant posts. I shall be trying to get a centre of higher education in Jalandhar.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

The court of Sessions Judge Gurbir Singh also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on the convict and in default of payment of fine he will have to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months. On September 5, 2015, Meherban police had booked Harnek Singh of Chuharwal village for attempting to murder Roshan Singh of the same village. As per the prosecution, Roshan Singh told police that on September 2, 2015, he was coming from Ludhiana to his village in Chuharwal. At about 9.30 pm, Harnek Singh, along with two unknown persons, was standing in the main chowk of the village. Harnek Singh, drunk at that time, was carrying iron rod and other two persons were empty handed. He struck Roshan Singh with the iron rod on his head and then struck him again. The other accomplices fled the spot. After being beaten up, Roshan Singh raised an alarm upon which his brother Jasvir Singh and uncle Satnam Singh came at the spot and rescued him. Harnek Singh ran away from the spot after leaving the iron rod there. His brother rushed him to the civil hospital from where he was discharged later. He added that Harnek Singh generally picks up fight with people without any reason. After registering a case against the accused, police arrested him on September 7, 2015. Later, police produced a chargesheet against the accused in the court. The additional public prosecutor for the state pleaded for punishment to the accused on the basis of prosecution evidence, including statement of the complainants\u2014 former Sarpanch Joginder Singh among other prosecution witnesses. Defence counsel argued that prosecution has miserably failed to prove the charges against the accused and the accused has been falsely implicated in the case. Defence witness Jasbir Singh, who is the real brother of complainant Roshan Singh, stepped into the witness box and deposed that accused Harnek Singh never caused any injury to Roshan Singh on September 2, 2015, he suffered injuries due to a roadside accident. He added that due to the political rivalry in the village, Harnek Singh was falsely implicated in the case. Another defence witness Satnam Singh, another relative of Roshan Singh, deposed on similar lines. The court turned down the plea of the defence about the false implication and injuries suffered by the complainant in road accident. \u201cSince the accused did not produce any evidence that Roshan Singh met with an accident on the said date and there is nothing on the file proving that Roshan Singh suffered injuries in the accident,\u201d the court held.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The FIR has been lodged following an inquiry by the SIT, formed by Punjab and Haryana high court after hearing a petition by Mukul Garg. On August 4, 2017, the Dugri police had arrested Mukul and Ramandeep in ATM fraud cases. In the early hours of August 5, Ramandeep was found hanging from the door of the washroom in police station with her dupatta.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar.

The forum discussed in detail the proposed draft to analyse its merits and demerits. It hailed the merits of the new education policy like enhancement of the right to education from the age of 3 to 18 years, and the provision of early childhood care from ages 3 to 6 by the institution where the child is admitted. The forum said the positive aspects of the policy were enhancing public funding to education, enhancement of funding to research to the tune of Rs20,000 crore, its policy of inclusiveness, categorisation of educational institutions, end of ad hocism by not allowing any temporary teachers, a stress-free examination system, multiple exit and entry points offered in higher education, and raising of general enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education by 50% up to 2030.

The participants in the discussion were college/school principals/teachers, academicians, philanthropists, and members of university senates and syndicates. The forum strongly wished the NDA to fulfil its commitment of spending 6% of the GDP on education, which at present is less than 4%. The forum had apprehensions about the funding of education in a federal country where states have little resources. One of the participants said: \u201cThe success of such policies depends on the funding of the union government. Past practices show that the union government\u2019s share in education is decreasing, and the state\u2019s share in the sector is increasing day by day.\u201d The forum also had concerns about the gap between declarations of the NDA government and the reality on the ground.

Out of this 50,000 MT has been completed by the FCI in PPP mode, through a local firm MRB Patiala Storage Private Limited. Now 50, 0000 MT of wheat will be moved from vulnerable to safe storage. One of the project developers Pawan Bansal said they started working on silos about 1.5 years ago and were now ready to provide additional storage from the current season. It was the first scientific storage facility in the district, he said. The project has come up in Chintanwali village with an investment of over Rs 55 crore. It was a widely-accepted global concept that was introduced in India a decade ago, but it had just started catching the fancy of government even as the country had been losing grains worth $14 billion annually, Bansal claimed. The private developers will run the facility in contract with FCI and would be paid a monthly rent of Rs 1,319 per MT. The state government had recently written to FCI authorities to send stored rice to other states in special trains to make room for wheat produce as the existing storage facilities in the state were full to the brim.

However, MC officials claimed they were issuing challan to offenders and several times, checking drives were also conducted, but most of the staff remained on duty during elections, so checking drives could not be conducted properly. In May, officials could issue only 45 challans for using plastic carrybags. Medical officer (Health) Dr Jasbir Kaur said teams were already formed for issuing challans to distributors supplying plastic carrybags to the public. She said now they would start special drives to crack the whip on offenders using carrybags with thickness less than 100 microns, which are banned. Plastic carrybags are being used in large quantities in the city with a population of nearly 16 lakh. These carrybags have increased the volume of garbage being collected from city roads. Also, they are among the major causes behind the blockage in Buddha Nullah. The carrybags accumulate in the drain, and then reach Satluj river as well. However, traders who make plastic carrybags argued that now there are no low-fat, recyclable poly carrybags manufactured in Punjab. Meanwhile, civic authorities have also been told to cut down their expenses, especially power expenses by 25%.

The court of judicial magistrate first class, Sangrur, Ajay Mittal, ordered that charges be framed under against Yadav under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. The other three accused, Vijay Kumar from Jind (Haryana), Nand Kishore and Gaurav Kumar from Tarn Taran (Punjab), are also facing charges under Section 124A (sedition) along with those faced by Yadav in the case. The Punjab government had granted sanction for their prosecution in sedition case in August last year.

Yadav has been out on the bail after he was remanded in police custody on July 24, 2016 for two days and had later remained in the judicial custody till August 1. On June 24, 2016, torn pages of the Quran were found scattered on a road in Muslim-dominated Malerkotla town of Sangrur. This had led to violence and burning of vehicles by an angry mob. Yadav was one of four people to be arrested in the case. The police had claimed that three others had confessed to their crime and Vijay had revealed that he wanted to \u201ctake revenge for Dinanagar and Pathankot terrorist attacks.\u201d The court of judicial magistrate first class, Ajay Mittal has now fixed July 3 as the next date of hearing when the case will be taken up for evidence.

A call has thus been issued by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Indian Dental Association (IDA) to observe \u2018complete bandh\u2019 for 24 hours in the city. The OPDs of all hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics will remain closed for 24 hours from 6am on Monday to 6am on Tuesday.

However, only emergency services and casualties will be attended. IMA president Dr PS Jassal said: \u201cThe attack by attendants of the patients is increasing every day. The unfortunate events in West Bengal and the repeated attacks on medical professionals is a big cause of worry. Time and time again, such acts have created a scare among medical professionals about practising in a fearless manner. Also, I have appealed to all members to gather at IMA Hall near Orient Cinema BRS Nagar on Monday at 10am. Considering the seriousness of the issue, if any doctor is found missing, the association would presume them to be busy with the OPD running,\u201d he added. Demanding a central act on violence against doctors and hospitals, IMA secretary Dr Bhim Kanish said: \u201cThe law should provide a minimum of seven years imprisonment for hospital violence, and ensure that cases are registered, and culprits arrested. Hospitals should be declared as special zones and provision of appropriate security should be the responsibility of the state.\u201d IDA president Aman Goyal said: \u201cI have appealed to all dental surgeons to abstain from clinical practice on Monday morning in OPDs across all dental clinics as a sign of protest.

Dr Arun Mitra, core committee member of ADEH, said: \u201cIn wake of the increasing violence against doctors across the country, we also urge the government to acknowledge the gravity of this crisis and take proactive and comprehensive steps to ensure the safety of the medical community. Along with enacting legislation for prevention of violence to healthcare professionals and institutions, the government should also focus on long-term investment in medical infrastructure, human resources and system reforms that ensure transparency in treatment, billing, and effective grievance redressal mechanisms.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Responding to a complaint, NHAI has also claimed that traffic congestion problem at Jalandhar has been sorted out as the traffic from Ludhiana to Jalandhar and to other destination faced no problem while passing through from the said flyover despite it being partially closed since March 29. Notably, flaw in the design was first pointed out by Jalandhar deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma and commissioner of police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar, who during their visit a few hours after its opening on March 29, found that a bottle neck had been created at the landing of the flyover. The problem arises as width of the flyover is six-lane and just where its landing the road ahead is four-lane wide.

The two officials held that the bottleneck \u2013 junction point of fast traffic on flyover and the vehicles going out from the city \u2013 was too risky and could lead to fatal accidents.

It has roped in a private company \u2014 ALPHAGEO (India) Limited \u2014 that is undertaking a two-dimensional seismic survey as part of the Government of India\u2019s project in many villages to ascertain whether the unexplored Ganga-Punjab basin, of which these areas are part of, has potential for oil exploration. If the potential is established, Ludhiana district will be able to generate crude oil. A scientist of the company, under whose leadership the survey is being conducted, said in India crude oil has been found at around five to six basins, including Bombay High, Baroda in Gujarat, Barmer in Rajasthan and in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, whereas in many basins in Madhya Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, there is not much scope. He added that Ganga-Punjab Basin, comprising Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab, has never been explored for oil potential and this was the first time a seismic study was being conducted. \u201cAs part of the study, we dug 20m-deep bores at multiple places along the six-km length in the villages and then connected them with geo phones. We then placed explosive material inside the bores and blast it with radio signals from a specialized vehicle. The current because of the vibration under the soil is measured to ascertain the possibility of oil reserves. The data generated with the help of this two-dimensional study will then be sent to ONGC, which will either analyze it on its own or send it to a laboratory for analysis,\u201d said the scientist. \u201cIf oil reserve is found, then they will get a three-dimensional study done and later a well will be dug to ascertain whether it is profitable or not. If found profitable, the ONGC will get the oil recovered from the reserve. In Ludhiana district till now we have carried out exercises in Ratipur, Panjgraiyan, Udhowal Khurd, Jharaudi villages of Machhiwara and many villages in Samrala.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Sewerage lines choked with garbage, filthy water flows on to streets": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/sewerage-lines-choked-with-garbage-filthy-water-flows-on-to-streets/articleshow/69806203.cms", "time": "2019-06-16 07:40:00", "description": "Ludhiana: With employees of the waste management firm allegedly not paying attention to garbage collection in Wards 12, 13, 15 and 16, waste matter from Tajpur Road is entering sewerage lines through open manholes, leading to sewage overflow.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda.

Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party.

BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far.

Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

They added that while checking suspicious persons and vehicles, the police party stopped a motorcycle bearing registration number PB08CV-1094. Cops said during a search of the accused, police recovered 82g of heroin from the possession of the accused. They added that the accused were then booked under sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and were arrested. The anti-narcotics wing officials said preliminary investigation suggested that the accused may have brought the consignment from Moga and were to supply it in Sidhwan Bet. They added that the estimated cost of the recovered consignment in the international market was around Rs45 lakh. The anti-narcotics wing in-charge inspector Navdeep Singh said the family had more than a dozen cases of drug peddling against them. He added that whereas the arrested accused had four such cases against him, his sister-in-law had been booked in a drug peddling case for the first time. The officials said the parents of Ramesh would peddle poppy husk, but their sons shifted to heroin smuggling some years ago because of the small size of consignments and more profit. They added that even the two sons-in-law of the family, who lived with them, had around 3-4 cases of drug peddling against them.

To avoid such incidents, research scholars at IIT Ropar have developed a low-cost smart earphones that would not only amplify the surrounding sounds, but will also merge it with the music audio signal. This would make the user aware of the surroundings even while listening to music, they say. The research was conducted by Mitali Rathod, Ishika Soni and Lakshya under the guidance of professor Mahendra Sakare. The researchers named their project \u2018Super Ears\u2019. Professor Sakare said that with further research it would be possible to use the earphones for spying, too. \u201cThe earphones have a microphone. With the help of different frequencies and tuning, they can be used to spy a particular person standing in a group of people making noises.

The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said.

Munish added that days later, the accused woman called her to her house in Dholewal, where she introduced the second accused Bunti as her brother. Further, he said the accused took Rs15 lakh from him in 2017 and 2018. The accused also took him to different hospitals of Jalandhar and Chandigarh., but every time they would return after some medical tests. When Munish pressurized him for a transplant, the accused started making excuses. When he asked a return of his money, the accused started ignoring him. Thereafter, on May 30, Munish Kumar lodged a police complaint, following which Division 8 police registered a case under Section 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC against the accused.

From Monday, it will kick off the exercise from ward 81. MC commissioner KP Brar will lead an awareness drive in the ward to ensure 100% segregation of dry and wet waste. For a week, residents will be taught about handing over waste separately to garbage collectors. \u201cWith the officials failing to implement waste segregation at source even in one ward, the commissioner has decided to take up the reins of the drive,\u201d said sources in MC. On June 14 and 15, Brar, engineer HS Aujla and councillors Mamta Ashu and Parvinder Lapran had visited Vellore to study its solid waste management. With the Tamil Nadu city ensuring cent per cent waste segregation, there are no secondary garbage collection points there. After studying its model, Ludhiana MC decided to start the segregation drive from one ward. Brar said, \u201cIn Vellore, every ward has a garbage compositing centre. The dry waste is either sold or treated. The wet waste is further segregated and either fed to chickens, turkeys and cows or turned into manure. Vellore has been working on it since 2015 and gained success after four years. Besides, the city is small and has a dedicated staff. In Ludhiana, we will first make ward 81 a model one and then take the drive to the rest of the city.\u201d The MC had held awareness drives in a few wards early this year, but those were interrupted by general elections.

In the third attack in 24 hours, terrorists lobbed a grenade at the headquarters of the 180 CRPF battalion camp in Tral sub-district of Pulwama late on Monday evening. The grenade exploded outside the headquarters. No casualties have been reported. The first attack happened on Monday morning when a team of security men was on a cordon-and-search operation in Achabal. Terrorists fired at the team, who then retaliated. In the Pulwama attack, the terrorists after setting off the IED, opened fire at the Army vehicle. \"Initial reports reveal the vehicle suffered extensive damage,\" the official said.

It gets very difficult for them during the summer months. They need special care. They are an important part of our ecosystem and the nature. To help them beat the heat, we should do every bit possible. We must provide shelters to dogs. Unlike humans, dogs can sweat only through their footpads and they cool themselves by panting.

If you are out in the sun, try to keep your pet off hot surfaces like cement and asphalt. Not only can it burn their paws, but increase their body temperature too and lead to overheating.\u201d He said spray water on the paws and stomach of your dog to help them cool down. \u201cOne can also rub their paws and stomach with wet a towel,\u201d he added. If you can\u2019t walk your dog during the early morning hours or late evening, doggy boots is a good option to protect their paws. Build bird houses and place it nearby parks. Involve children with DIY (do it on your own) activities of making bird houses. Dr Pawan Tiwari, bachelor of veterinary science, New Tagore Nagar, said: \u201cIt is time to save pets and stray animals from the scorching heat. Make shelters in parks or outside your homes to provide them protection from the sun\u2019s heat. Provide food to stray dogs as it is a weapon to make them feel good.
