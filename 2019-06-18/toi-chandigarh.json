The IMA said the 24-hour shutdown was just a glimpse of what could follow if the issues were not addressed. Dr Sushil Gupta, former president, IMA, Chandigarh, said more than 1,000 senior doctors had resigned from government hospitals owing to the \u201cinhumane treatment\u201d meted out to their junior colleagues.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "City doctors send OPDs in ICU": {"description": "CHANDIGARH: Outdoor patient department (OPD) services were on Monday affected in all three major hospitals \u2014 PGIMER, Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16, and Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32 \u2014 as doctors called off work to express solidarity with their colleagues in Kolkata. Thousands of patients who reached these hospitals had to return home without check-up. The most-affected were those who had come from far-off places, especially to PGI OPDs. Hori Lal, a resident of Mandi Gobindgarh, Punjab, had come to PGI in the morning after taking a leave without pay from the mill where he works to show his wife who has been experiencing pain in her right hand. He reached at 10am and waited till 1pm before returning disappointed. \u201cI had to spend Rs 700 to come here with my wife and daughter. But this time it was all for a waste. We will have to return next Monday now as the doctor only sits on that day. She has extreme pain in her hand and was hopeful of getting some relief today. We had thought the cause of pain would be known and medicine would be given for relief as we got the CT scan report along, but no one saw it,\u201d he said. In the sectors 16 and 32 hospitals, OPDS were shut down at 8.30am, while PGI doctors had announced on Sunday that they would suspend work in OPDs. In all three hospitals, especially in PGI, the faculty attended to patients in OPDs. In PGI, a contingency plan was devised to ensure functioning of the institute to the maximum extent possible. The OPD services were curtailed by reducing the registration timings by two hours. The OPD and diagnostic services were run by faculty, sponsored residents, foreign national residents and technical staff. As many as 3,596 patients were registered in the OPD on Monday, while 23 surgeries were performed till 5pm. All the emergency services, including labour room services, and intensive care units, functioned in a routine manner as these services were exempted from strike. Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGI, called a meeting of heads of departments on Sunday at 8 am to discuss the issue and prepare a contingency plan. Accordingly, a contingency plan was drafted and distributed to all heads of departments on Sunday itself. Dr BS Chavan, director, GMCH, said, \u201cThough doctors called a shutdown, our faculty worked hard and covered 1,500 patients in the OPDs on Monday. They were on night duty as well. If the strike continues, our faculty will be at work.\u201d In the protest on Monday, the doctors of three hospitals were joined in by members of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula units, which too had called for a strike for 24 hours till Tuesday. Doctors from different institutes joined the protest march in the evening. Dr Uttam Thakur, president, Association of Resident Doctors, PGI, said, \u201cThere is a need to enact laws in the entire country for safety of the doctors. Central security Act needs to be implemented in the whole of the country.\u201d He said that if the demands were not, then they might even suspend emergency services, but added it would be the last resort. Spend more on health: PGI doctorDr Siddharth Jain, senior resident, rheumatology, PGI, said, \u201cThere is lack of understanding between patients and doctors and this is because of the lack of facilities. Public sentiments increase because of the delay in getting services as either there is shortage of doctors or that of hospitals.\u201d \u201cThere is a need to increase the money being spent on health in the country, which at present does not match with the standards of WHO. We need to strengthen the infrastructure. All the doctors joining in for the cause shows the severity of the situation and need for the government to act fast,\u201d he said.

A senior UT official said they want to accommodate vendors in different vending zones in the city, but with the consent of traders as well. They have now planned to involve traders, while creating vending zones in the city. The final decision in this regard will be taken next week, he added. There were protests from traders of sectors 17, 15 and 22, in recent past against the UT and MC\u2019s move to rehabilitate vendors in these markets.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

They were also directed to refund the entire booking amount of Rs 8,702 to the complainant. Veer Singh, the complainant, who is a practicing advocate, booked hotel accommodation on June 13, 2016 for three days and two nights in two rooms, one a double occupancy which the complainant had booked for his friend, and the other a triple occupancy, which the complainant had booked for himself and his family in Hotel Nandini Homestay, situated in Dharamshala, through Oravel\u2019s website, oyorooms-.com. The complainant checked into the hotel according to the schedule on June 24, 2016. After check-in, the proprietor of the hotel approached the complaint and claimed that the two rooms into which the complainant and his friend checked-in had already been booked prior to the complainant making the booking through oyorooms.com and offered to shift them to better rooms. The complainant did not accede to the aforesaid offer and slept there on the night of June 24, 2016. On June 25, 2016, the complainant embarked on a trip to McLeod Ganj with his family after placing the keys of the rooms with the staff only for housekeeping and room cleaning. However, upon return to the hotel, the complainant was shocked to see that without his consent the luggage and other personal items were shifted to different set of rooms, which were the worst of the lot in the entire hotel. The complainant tried to contact the proprietor of the hotel, but to no avail. The complainant said he even requested oyorooms-.com to arrange a habitable room in the said hotel or to accommodate them in a different hotel of equal footing, but nothing came out of it. In its reply, Oravel stated that it entered into the agreement on March 15, 2016 with the hotel to promote its hotel to expand its business. According to the agreement, their responsibility and liability was limited to the extent of booking that was conducted on their platform and that they would only try to resolve issues that a customer may face during the visit. The sole responsibility of the operation of the said hotel was of the owner of hotel. According to the record maintained by the hotel, there was only one issue raised by the complainant for changing the rooms provided and the same was resolved. Moreover, website cannot be held liable for any act done by the hotel. No one appeared on behalf of the hotel. Forum after hearing both sides stated that, \u201cSince the booking was made through its platform, we are of the concerted opinion that Oravel is substantially involved with the hotel in selling hotel services to prospective consumers and under the garb of marketing, both are running a joint venture. Thus, oravel cannot be allowed to evade its liability on the ground that its role is limited to the extent of arranging the hotel booking through its platform. The hotel and the website have certainly and definitely indulged into unfair trade practice, the forum held. Also, they did not bother to redress the grievance of the complainant when contacted by him, resulting in immense, mental and physical harassment to the complainant, forum observed. Based on the findings hotel and Oravel were directed to pay up.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath.

The situation is worse in Sector 19 and Sector 21, where the residents claim that the area is teeming with dogs. According to the dispensary records at Sector 19, approximately 350 dog bite cases, involving both stray and domestic dogs, are reported every month. Residents said that they are finding it difficult to even step outside their houses. When TOI visit the two sectors, residents said that they have to carry laathis with them to keep the dogs away. They also said that when the MC tries to relocate the dogs, they face objection from a few animal lovers who live in the area. According to them, dogs not only bite, but they also chase twowheelers and four-wheelers, which sometimes result in accidents. According to 2012 dog census, there were 7,847 stray dogs and 9,824 domestic dogs in Chandigarh. The number has risen to 13,000-14,000 in the last four to five years, the reason being the uncontrolled breeding of these dogs. Acknowledging the complaints and concerns of the residents, Asha Jaswal, the area councillor, said, \u201cWhen we receive complaints about dogs, the MC sends dog catchers to catch the dog. They then keep the dog in shelter homes for four to five days and release them after vaccination, according to ABC guidelines. If a dog is ill or not sterilized, he is sterilized and kept for 10-12 days in the shelter homes.\u201d \u201cWe have complained to the MC many times, but they are unable to handle the situation.

However, nothing could change the destiny, neither the best of medical attention nor the ardent prayers of the family and friends as Jasvir Kaur could not be retrieved from her precarious condition and was finally declared brain dead on 12th June following the protocols of THOA.

But even in this darkest hour, husband Som Nath, amid his own grief, showed exceptional courage and magnanimity by consenting to donate the organs of his deceased wife Jasvir Kaur. Following the consent, the deceased\u2019s kidneys were harvested and transplanted to two best matched renal failure patients giving them a second chance to live. The retrieved corneas were transplanted to another two patients, restoring their eye sight and bringing light to their lives. It was a sight of mixed emotion at PGIMER.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Meanwhile, the hospital is jam-packed with patients and their family members as doctors remain away. A nurse from the OPD confirmed that emergency services are still being provided, but elective surgeries have been put on hold, as no doctor on OPD duty has reported to the hospital since morning. Consultants have been instructed to guide the patients, yet hundreds of them remain stranded. The delay in treatment has caused many patients to wait in the already full hallways of the hospital. As a result, there is lack of space, beds and wheelchairs for the patients. The skeletal staff at the hospital is overburdened and is unable accept reports of OPD patients.

It is a relatively common condition with varying severity and is estimated to affect approximately one in six adults and its incidence increases with age. Prof (Dr) Uttam Mete, Urology Department, PGIMER, Chandigarh said that are witnessing a surge of women patients in their early 40's to be suffering from this embarrassing condition. The patient suffering from it complains of leakage of urine while laughing, coughing, sneezing and other things that put pressure on the bladder. Dr Uttam Mete said that this condition is more common among women than men since the woman's bladder muscles are affected in pregnancy and child birth besides women have a short urethra. Three years ago, a lady school teacher started going to the toilet 10 to 14 times a day. She would on many occasions have to rush out in the middle of class to use the bathroom. Accidental leaking of urine is not a joke but a seriously annoying problem. Hence to create awareness about this embarrassing condition globally World Continence Week is observed every year. This year the week is observed from June 17 to June 23. Informs (Dr) Uttam Mete that In some cases, the urge to urinate may be so strong that it can result in leaks before the patient can reach the bathroom. Most people who suffer from urinary incontinence live with it because they believe there is nothing they can do about it. Experts say that awareness about OAB is critical when it comes to reducing the stigma associated with bladder health. People should not suffer silently. It is a treatable condition. At present there are numerous ways to treat it which includes lifestyle changes, diet, medication and surgery if required. Behavioural interventions such as kegel exercises often help manage an overactive bladder and control urine leakage. Your doctor can help you learn these easy to do exercises at home. If you develop any of the symptoms of OAB, experts advise you to limit your caffeinated beverages (coffee, tea), avoid spicy foods and refrain from alcohol as it would worsen your condition.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

In view of its success, the project is being extended to several other areas of the town. Under the project, material receiving facilities (MRFs) used as garbage segregation centres have been set up at three places in the town where the garbage is collected, segregated and used or disposed of, depending on the composition of the garbage. The project is being run with 16 employees, including four supervisors, eight cart pullers and four segregators, who collect user charges from residents. There is a plan to generate money by selling recyclable waste and compost. As part of the scheme, it has been ensured that the persons employed for garbage collection from households or business establishments and its segregation must have access to various civic amenities with special emphasis on availability of water and toilets. People residing in the areas where project is working, put domestic garbage in white, green and red colour dustbins. The white dustbin holds refused eatables, green dustbins biodegradable material and the red dustbin contain non-biodegradable material. Leftover eatables of the white dustbins are sent to cattle pond in the town twice a day to feed cattle heads. The biodegradable content from the green dustbin is collected into a pit especially constructed for it. At the MRF, there are 12 pits of 10x3x4 feet dimension. One of the pits has already been filled with the biodegradable waste and will produce 5 to 7 tonnes of compost after 90 days. The contents of red dustbins (which have non-biodegradable garbage) are segregated into recyclable and non-recyclable categories. The recyclable content is sold off to junk dealers, while the non-recyclable waste is discarded. Mansa Deputy Commissioner Apneet Riyait, who is the brain behind the project, said, \u201cThe project is running successfully and being appreciated by people. In view of the success of the project, three more such segregation centres have been planned in next two months. The municipal council authorities have been asked to purchase two machines which are specially designed to separate bio and non-bio degradable garbage from the legacy garbage\u201d. \u201cWe are trying to create awareness on garbage management right from the household level to taking it as a profit making enterprise for the people involved in it,\u201d she said, adding that the town\u2019s residents have been informed about the use of white, green and red dustbins. The people have been shown through projectors how to use the waste and how it is processed telling them that the white dustbin is for fodder for the cattle, green bin for green waste, which can be used to make fertilizers and red dustbin for dry garbage which can be recycled.Mansa: Aiming to get rid the town from garbage dumps, the 'three dustbins' (3D) project, focussing on creating clean environment for healthy living, launched in January in a small part of Mansa town has now started showing its results and is being extended to many other areas.

For the owners if they are ready to undertake the specified norms of care meant for exotic animals, owning them is a matter of pride. Some of the specifications that owners need to take care of include, sterilization of their cages on a regular basis, food must contain certain levels of protein, their social behavior needs to be tackled with maturity and they need time to adapt to the environment. When it comes to rats, their breeding rates could be a problem. Dealing with the infants is critical as most of them are unable to survive-.Mosst of them even learn topond to their names when called. Experts say with their unique behaviors and social interactions, with the humans they can actually teach a lot of things. These exotic species have very specific environmental requirements and are easy to manage once familiar to the surrounding. Once comfortable, they provide the same amount of love and affection as any big dog or cat point out experts. These creatures are social, intelligent and can be a little trained as well. Nowadays pet lovers are getting inclined towards guinea pigs, rabbits, fancy rats and those who love chirping want to have budgerigar and cocktail birds for their versatility.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The audit has been conducted after a blaze at a commercial complex in Surat, Gujrat killed at least 20 students who were attending their coaching centres and the drive will continue till June 7. Fire officials admit that though warnings have been issued to owners of building that iconnections would be snapped, some have now started on the connections of water and Fire officer of Mohali, Arun Khanna said that the fire audit report has been submitted with DC as well as MC Commissioner following which MC Commissioner has sent notices to such violators giving them 7 days\u2019 time to comply with fire safety norms and obtain NOC from fire department. Thereafter those who does not obtain NOC will face legal action. Khanna said that the audit found that apart from defunct fire extinguishers or poor smoke detectors, the main problem was also buildings not having separate fire exits. He said, \u201cWe have observed that most of the premises does not have separate fire exits. The entry-exits are common at most of the places calling for major fire tragedy. Such building owners have been given separate notices.\u201d Derabassi Chief Fire Officer said that major problem in various housing societies is of haphazard parking of cars leaving no space for fire tender to reach out during fire emergency. One such society is Spangle Heights in Dhakoli in Zirakpur where three residents suffered burn injuries after LPG pipeline triggered blast in kitchen of a flat. The residents had miraculous escape after the blast. Meanwhile during a reality check in Panchkula, high-rise buildings and market areas were found flouting all the norms and no safety norms were being adhered to in high rise buildings. When a TOI team visited Sector-14, 11 and 9 market, found hanging wires in the staircase of the buildings and also found illegal temporary constructions inside the building to make temporary offices or classrooms at coaching centres with poor quality material, completely violating the norms of the fire safety guidelines. The rooftop of the buildings had power generators without any shade cover on them and had flammable liquids and materials also dumped on the top floor of the building. At high rise buildings located in Sector-20, most of the societies were found well-equipped.

Now, they have again invited expression of interest and interested firms can upload their documents on June 18. The CTU can significantly enhance their revenue through advertisement on buses and bus queue shelters, he added.

Of these, 413 run on local/suburban routes connecting Chandigarh with Panchkula and Mohali. The CTU buses ply on 75 routes, the waiting period for boarding a bus varies from 20 minutes to over 1.5 hour. The buses ferry around 2 lakh passengers on a daily basis. On an average, a CTU bus plies 389.83 passengers per bus per day. The low frequency of buses is said to be one of the main reasons behind the residents staying away from public transport. Recently, the CTU had launched a service enabling commuters to track long route buses in real time and know estimated time of arrival (ETA) through phone app. CTU had developed mobile application in which automatic vehicle location system (AVLS) and passenger information system (PIS) have been embedded.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Recently, the Punjab and Haryana high court had expressed its dissatisfaction over the definition given by UT to street vending under the Street Vending Act. The HC had pointed out that how come footpaths and parking zones could be called streets. The HC also made a satirical remark and said that if footpaths and parking zones could be streets then UT should also include parks under the Street Vending Act and allow street vendors there. There are a total of 9,200 vendors in the city. Of these 1,900 deal with essential commodities and they will stay at their existing place of vending due to the nature of their services. Besides, 6,500 registered vendors deal in non-essential commodities, who will be accommodated in vending zones identified by the Chandigarh administration.

Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Congratulations to him on becoming the working president of the party,\" the Prime Minister added. Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president. Nadda has long experience of the party organisation as he was the in-charge of the party headquarters and is a popular figure.

Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

Sidhu was given charge of the department of power, new and renewal energy resources, and Soni was allocated the medical education & research, freedom fighters and food processing departments. In the reshuffle, Sidhu was divested of the local government and tourism and cultural affairs departments and Soni of the school education department. Senior officers in power as well as medical education and research departments said on Monday that there is no word from either Sidhu or Soni till date as to when they would take charge and start attending office. Sidhu is present in his official residence at Chandigarh, but is avoiding interaction with the media. Soni is staying in Amritsar and sources close to him said he had no plans to take charge of the new department any time soon and would stay in Amritsar at least another two days. A senior officer in the power department, who did not want to be identified, said according to standard procedure, decisions are taken by the chief minister in the absence of a minister of a particular department. But, the officer clarified, there is hardly one file in a week that needs the minister\u2019s concurrence in the power department and till date after the cabinet portfolios were changed on June 6 no file needed a ministerial okay. The functioning of the power department is mostly dependent on the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) and the Punjab State Transmission Corporation Ltd (PSTCL). Sources in the Congress said party president Rahul Gandhi is believed to have made it clear to Sidhu, during their interaction in New Delhi on June 10 that he should take charge of his new department. Therefore, there are hardly any efforts from the Congress leadership to intervene in the issue. Amarinder is expected to meet Rahul in New Delhi later this week and the stalemate will continue, at least till then.

Out patient departments (OPDs) of all private and government hospitals were closed. Patients were seen sitting in waiting halls to get medical aids, hoping the doctors might come back after calling off the strike. However, the protesting doctors with black ribbons pinned on their shoulders claimed only OPDs were closed and all essential services, including rounds by doctors in wards, were not affected. The protesting doctors also presented a memorandum to health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu demanding protection. Dr Sanjeet Singh Sodhi, president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Mohali, said there have been a number of incidents in the recent years of doctors already working under stressful conditions being assaulted by patients or their relatives. \u201cThe recent incident in West Bengal is appalling to say the least. Doctors must get better security,\u201d he said. Sidhu assured the protesting doctors that if any such incident occurs in Punjab, there would be immediate registration of an FIR against the accused. Dr Viren Dhankhar, secretary, IMA, Mohali, stated that a surgeon would never be able to give his best in high-risk cases if he has the fear of violence in his mind. This will ultimately be detrimental to the health of the patient, he said. According to Dr Charandeep Singh, there are various avenues for complaints against negligence but taking law into one\u2019s own hands is not acceptable. Dr Ashwani Kansal said IMA, Mohali, has full sympathies for the patients but has no option other than to cease OPD and non-essential medical work for the day to protest the unruly behaviour of the patients. Dr P Singh appealed to the West Bengal and the central government to take steps toward imparting justice to the assaulted doctors and prevent any violent incident in the future.
