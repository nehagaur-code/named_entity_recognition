At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "\nWhen music ruled supreme at this event in Lucknow!\n": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/when-music-ruled-supreme-at-this-event-in-lucknow/articleshow/69294370.cms", "time": "", "description": "A private school in lucknow, celebrating 60-years of its establishemnt, organised a western classical music concert, Historic International Concert of the Indian National Youth Orchestra, conducted by Lucknow-born composer and conductor Vijay Upadhyaya.

The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

A police officer said they had found the body of a Pakistani terrorist and seized arms and ammunition from the encounter site. The identity of the slain terrorist was being ascertained.

This has upset power employees who say this will invite strong protest. In a note to all states, including UP, the Niti Aayog has said distribution companies may adopt a franchisee model for retail business in rural areas and stipulate minimum performance parameters, including the use of decentralised generation sources and storage systems for local reliability and resilience. The recommendations come at a time the UP government is grappling with line losses, particularly arising out of power thefts, to the tune of 25-30% against an expected 15%. As of now, only Agra and Noida have entrusted private companies with power distribution. While Torrent does the job in Agra, NPCL works in Noida. Implementation of the Niti Aayog recommendation will mean that power distribution of other discoms such as Madhyanchal, Paschimanchal, Dakshinanchal, Poorvanchal and Kesco will rest with private companies, who will not only maintain infrastructure but also generate electricity bills for consumers. Energy minister Srikant Sharma told TOI the state government would review the recommendation before taking any further step. \u201cThe objective is to improve the power distribution system and the government is working in that direction,\u201d he said. The development, nevertheless, has sent power employees into a tizzy. President of All India Power Engineers Federation Shailendra Dubey said any move to privatise distribution would invite strong protests. \u201cAttempts have failed in the past 25 years. The energy department should initiate talks with power employees before taking another drastic decision. The aim should be to provide better and cheap power to consumers,\u201d Dubey said. The federation plans to write to Union power minister RK Singh on the issue. The idea to privatise power distribution was first mooted under the Mayawati government in 2009, after which Agra was handed over to Torrent. The Akhilesh Yadav government came up with a similar plan for Kanpur, but the move was thwarted by power employee protests. Among its other important recommendations, the Niti Aayog has suggested performance-based incentive in the tariff structure. It has said that to manage the demand for power, it is necessary to introduce 100% metering, use of smart meters and metering of electricity supplied to agriculture.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

H Raja to contest from Sivaganga for third timeH Raja is contesting from Sivaganga for the third time. In 2014, he came third with 1.33 lakh votes, while in 1999, he came second. It will be a keenly fought battle between Tamilisai and DMK\u2019s state women wing secretary and Rajya Sabha MP K Kanimozhi in Tuticorin. Though Tamilisai initially preferred to contest from Chennai South, which has a sizeable votebank for the party, she finally settled for Tuticorin. AIADMK was keen on retaining south Chennai for sitting MP, J Jayavardhan, son of fisheries minister D Jayakumar. Former TN BJP chief Radhakrishnan will face CPM\u2019s P R Natarajan in Coimbatore. This is the fifth time that Radhakrishnan has been fielded in Coimbatore, a BJP stronghold. While he won two consecutive Lok Sabha elections in 1998 and 1999, he was defeated in the 2004 and 2014 polls. Nainar Nagendran has been pitted against DMK\u2019s IUML candidate K Nawaz Kani. While the party made a quick decision on candidates for four constituencies, Ramanathapuram delayed matters considering the keen contest for the seat among some senior leaders.

Sharma admitted that there might be some problems because of overloading and subsequent tripping of power supply in the rural areas. He, however, rubbished the allegation of power cuts being driven by political vendetta. \u201cUnlike previous government, all districts are VIP districts for us,\u2019\u2019 he said. Sharma said that the department is consistently monitoring snags in power supply through a dedicated phone number -- 1912. \u201cIn the present case, the department was trying to find out where the problem actually lay,\u2019\u2019 claimed Sharma.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Adding that efforts must be made to save rain water as far as possible, the PM further wrote: \u201cLet us get trenches made around the fields, build check dams and dikes, take up cleaning and rejuvenation of ponds, construct tankaas (underground water storage tanks) and ensure zero wastage of the rain water.\u201d Officials in the state rural development informed that the letter is being sent to over 97,000 heads in 75 districts of UP.

NITI Aayog\u2019s Composite Water Management Index Report 2018 also expressed concern over the situation in UP. Stated that the groundwater crisis in UP is progressively worsening, the report attributed the problem to factors like unplanned urbanisation, unabated boring, rampant exploitation of groundwater and surface water by government and private bodies, failure to replenish it through rainwater harvesting and lack of awareness among people among other things. It pointed out that the state has a gross withdrawal of about 5.28 million hectares, among the highest in India.

A number of success stories can be heard but many things are taking place in pockets. Stakeholder departments must ensure that a micro-planning is undertaken before people join the bandwagon,\u201d he said. He informed that there were demand and supply aspects to water conservation \u2013 be it on the ground or beneath it. \u201cStrategies listed out by the PM speak about the paradigm of supply. Strategies change from place to place. Steps must be taken to reduce the demand to check wastage and ensure optimum utilisation of available water,\u201d he explained.

One of the vice-presidents of the party told TOI that though BJP had won 312 Assembly seats in 2017, the 2019 Lok Sabha election saw the lead of the party coming down to 284, despite registering overall increase in vote share in 385 Assembly seats. The BJP leadership, while deliberating at length on the success of the party in the Lok Sabha elections, emphasised that the membership drive should have focus on members of Jatav and Yadav communities who voted in less number for the BJP as compared to other social sections.

Hundreds of resident doctors from three government hospitals and thousands of others from private hospitals resorted to strike on a call by Indian Medical Association. The three government hospitals whose doctors joined the stir are Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), King George's Medical University (KGMU) and Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS). With resident doctors striking work, the government hospital failed to admit any new patient, leaving senior doctors to attend to old patients only in the OPD. The situation in various private hospitals was worse where even the OPD remained non-operational. Patients, some of them in serious conditions, were seen waiting outside various government and private hospitals, making fervent pleas to the medical staffers to attend to their problems. SGPGIMS chief medical superintendent Amit Agarwal said some 150 doctors of the institute were on strike due to which no operation was performed or new patients admitted. \"Though new patients are not being admitted, senior doctors are attending to the ones already admitted in the hospital,\" said Dr Agarwal. KGMU spokesperson Sudhir Singh, however, claimed the work was only partially affected in the hospital, which has a strength of 575 resident doctors. Claiming that some resident doctors were working in some departments, Singh said 3,580 patients were attended to in the OPD, while 104 new patients were admitted and 22 operations performed. Similar conditions prevailed in the Lohia Hosptial. IMA Lucknow unit president G P Singh, meanwhile, said besides the resident doctors, some 4,000 private doctors struck work in private hospitals, nursing homes and clinics. Only emergency patients were being treated in private hospitals, Dr Singh said, adding hundreds of doctors held a protest at the IMA office here and demanded security for themselves. Balrampur Hospital director Rajiv Lochan said the patient flow has gone up by 35 to 40 per cent following the strike in other hospitals. Dr Lochan, however, claimed that medical services were going on as routine as there were no resident doctors there. Reports from Jhansi, Meerut, Gorakhpur and Varanasi said the strike call evoked a mixed response.

Even if you have scored as low as five marks in the Lucknow University management entrance test, you stand a chance of getting admission to the course. LU has invited all candidates who have appeared for the entrance test for admission to its management courses for counselling on Tuesday. A candidate scoring marks even in single digit in the entrance test is likely to get admission. This is because for admission to 600 MBA seats, only 742 candidates had appeared for the entrance test. Besides, a number of candidates did not turn up for counselling.

However, two hours later the hospital staff informed her that the appointment had been cancelled as doctors were on strike. She still did not leave the queue. Finally, at 11.30am, hospital staff told all patients to leave. \u201cI will have to stay here on footpath so that I can see the doctor on Tuesday.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

Nadda's appointment as working president was on the cards after he was not inducted into the government. Since Shah will need to meet his ministerial commitments, Nadda, as a full time party functionary, is expected to help him with the nitty-gritty of organisational tasks. \"I am confident that under the leadership of Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and powered by the hard work of our karyakartas (workers), BJP will continue winning people's trust and serving our society.

Congratulations to him on becoming the working president of the party,\" the Prime Minister added. Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said.

Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future? What new has she brought in?\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Lucknow: Mercury soars to 45C, breaches two-year record": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mercury-soars-to-45c-breaches-2-year-record/articleshow/69807495.cms", "time": "2019-06-16 09:08:00", "description": "LUCKNOW: As maximum temperature touched almost 45 degrees Celsius on Saturday, the city recorded its hottest day in the past two years.

So, I want him to make government awake on the increasing cases of crime.\" Akhilesh also said false cases are being framed against party leader and MP from Rampur, Azam Khan, to pressurise the party leadership.

Presiding over a review meeting of the education department, he also set a week's deadline for police verification of drivers and conductors so that the process was completed before schools reopened after summer vacation. Yogi said most private schools would reopen after June 20 and government ones after July 1, which meant police verification should be completed ahead of that. The CM's concerns over student safety stem from accidents involving school vehicles in the recent past. In March, a school bus overturned in Etah leaving several children injured. In Bhadohi earlier this year, at least 12 students suffered burns when a school bus caught fire from a leaking cooking gas cylinder strapped to the vehicle. In April 2018, 13 schoolchildren were killed when a school van was hit by a speeding train in Kushinagar. It was later found that the van did not have a valid permit and the driver, who also died in the mishap, was a minor. To streamline functioning of educational institutions in the state, the government had earlier slashed the number of holidays and this, Yogi said, was benefiting students. \"In fact, the practice is being adopted by other state governments too,\" he said, adding that teachers must utilise holidays to communicate with parents. \"Government school offices must thus reopen by June 25.\" The CM emphasised on constitution of Former Students' Council in every school, college and university. \"Former students should be felicitated on August 15 and January 26. Many of them are now IAS and PCS officers, politicians or businessmen, who can financially assist their respective alma mater,\" he said. Yogi also harped on the need to conduct free and fair exams.

Till late Monday evening, as many as 489 seats in various subjects were lying vacant. With only a day left for admissions to be finalised, the chances of these seats getting filled are dim. In subjects like home science, Urdu, Arab culture, French, jyotir vigyan and Arabic, more than 30% of seats are vacant while in Persian, not a single seat of the 60 has a candidate. Even honours courses such as public policy and Hindi have failed to attract candidates with just 50% seats filled in both. For admission to 60 seats each in public policy and Hindi, only 28 and 31 candidates turned up, respectively. Admission coordinator Anil Mishra cited poor choice of career options and less familiarity of students with these subjects as the reasons behind the response.
