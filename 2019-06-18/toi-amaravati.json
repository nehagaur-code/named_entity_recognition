Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The senior officials are worried about several big deals that have been handled allegedly by violating rules. In fact, several senior officials wanted to coolly leave the CRDA by seeking permission from the chief secretary. Sources said that CM-designate YS Jagan has himself asked the chief secretary not to relieve any official working at the CRDA till further instructions. He believed to have also asked a top official in the CRDA to remain in the office to get a comprehensive report on the land deals ready. CRDA pooled nearly 33,000 acres of land under Land Pooling Scheme (LPS) from 29 villages in the capital city Amaravati. About 22,000 farmers were made to give up their land under LPS. The state government headed by Chandrababu Naidu announced the LPS for capital city a week after the announcement of capital city location in December, 2014. As per the LPS, the farmers were offered about 1000 sq yards of residential plot and 450 sq.yards of commercial plot for each acre of land in river bank area and 1000 sq.yard of residential plot and 250 sq.yards of land for each acre in dry land area. However, LPS policy did not spell out anything about pooling up assigned lands in the area in the initial stage. Taking this ambiguity to advantage, the ruling TDP leaders spread panic among the dalit farmers that the government is intending to take over the assigned lands without offering any compensation as rules allows it. The worried farmers sold out their lands at throw away prices to the TDP leaders. To the utter shock of the dalits, the government decided to take assigned lands too under LPS after considerable extent of land changed hands. Besides, the revenue records found that there were no eligible owners of some government poramboke lands in the area. However, majority of all such lands have been converted into assigned lands and handed over to the TDP leaders which were finally transferred to CRDA under LPS. The state government believed to have pooled up nearly 6,000 acres of assigned lands from illegal owners and granted them land compensation under LPS. According to information, a senior official in CRDA had been abstaining from duties since the government changed hands. Another senior official was moving earth and heaven to move out of CRDA before the actual probe begins into the issue.

He also told officials to prepare a report on the functioning of 108 and 104 ambulances and improve the services by adding new vehicles. The CM expressed his displeasure over the unhygienic conditions prevailing in government hospitals and primary health centres. While asking for a status report on all government hospitals in the state, he asked officials to improve the facilities and make them model hospitals. \u201cThe country should look and admire our health initiatives, including the government hospitals. Ensure that quality health is provided to people in all government hospitals,\u201d he said. He also promised to improve the facilities in the hospitals, adding that he would personally monitor the health and medical department. Jagan also enquired about the recent developments in the state of medical education, wondering why officials did not take action when medical seats were not increased due to lack of facilities.

He also appointed Rajampet MP P V Midhun Reddy as the party\u2019s floor leader in Lok Sabha, and Rajahmundry MP Margani Bharath as chief whip. The parliamentary party meeting of the YSRC, which was held on May 25, had authorised Jagan to make these appointments. Vijayasai, a close associate of Jagan, has been playing a key role in YSRC\u2019s affairs and is considered quite close to the party president. His role in Delhi, both inside the Parliament and outside it, including liaisoning with the central government, helped Jagan and the party on several issues. Despite the TDP being an ally of the BJP and part of the NDA government, Vijayasai used to have good access to the PMO even during those days. Ever since his election to the upper house, Vijayasai was among the most vocal critics of the TDP and its chief N Chandrababu Naidu at the national level. YSRC floor leader P V Midhun Reddy is a two-time MP and a close aide of Jagan. As this term is crucial for both the party and its president in having a healthy relationship with the central government, Jagan wanted Midhun to lead the party\u2019s 22 MPs on the floor of the Lok Sabha.

This is the highest proportion of first-timers in the total strength of the assembly in recent history. Interestingly, as many as 67 of the 70 new legislators are from the YSRC, while only three were elected on a TDP ticket. This is nearly 45% of the actual strength of the YSRC in the assembly. Analysts are of the opinion that Y S Jaganmohan Reddy's experiment with new faces played a big role in the party sweeping the elections as people were tired of long-standing and veteran leaders fielded by the TDP. Many TDP veteran leaders, including six-time legislators Kodela Sivaprasada Rao and five-time MLA Dhulipalla Narendra Kumar lost the elections. The TDP had also been successful when it fielded new faces like Adireddi Bhavani (Rajahmundry Urban), Maddali Giridhar (Guntur West) and Ramaraju (Undi). Similarly, sitting legislator of Undi constituency Kalavapudi Siva, who had a clean image in the constituency, had lost when he was fielded from Narsapuram Lok Sabha constituency. Addanki legislator Gottipati Ravikumar has the rare distinction of being sworn in as YSRC MLA in the last assembly and a TDP MLA in the present assembly.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added.

Although, Jagan is believed to be sympathetic towards these senior leaders, he is of the view that the job in the cabinet is an altogether a different one. Jagan is reportedly unwilling to take any chances by keeping outspoken MLAs in his cabinet. Sources said that Jagan might consider giving the berth to leaders like Ambati and Roja only as last option when all the equations and calculations of caste, region, gender and district are in their favour. Ambati Rambabu, who defeated assembly Speaker of Naidu\u2019s term, Dr Kodela Sivaprasada Rao in Sattenapalle constituency, is in fact the one among the first batch of leaders who quit Congress party about nine years ago and stayed firm with Jagan. He was the YSRCP\u2019s chief spokesperson for several years. An articulate orator, Ambati is a two-time legislator and staunch follower of late chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy. Analysts believe that Ambati, who hails from kapu community, should have been the automatic choice to be in the cabinet from the community quota. Although, at least 3-4 kapus would find berths in the cabinet of Jagan when it is fully expanded to the maximum strength of 26 (including CM), it is believed that Ambati might find it very difficult to get a chance. Sources said that senior kapu leader and MLC Ummareddi Venkateswarlu might be in the contention for the cabinet berth from Guntur district quota. While Mangalagiri legislator, Alla Ramakrishna Reddy, who defeated Chandrababu Naidu\u2019s son Lokesh in Mangalagiri, is expected to be the first choice, Guntur East legislator Mohammed Mustafa is likely to get the chance in minority quota. Although, Amjad Basha of Kadapa is in the race for the berth from minority quota, sources said that Kadapa district might not get any additional berths except CM due to the intense pressures from senior legislators Gadikota Srikanth Reddy, Korumutla Srinivasulu. Sources said that senior leader Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy might be the lone face from Chittoor to be in the cabinet. Nagari MLA Roja (Reddy) is facing stiff competition from Jagan\u2019s die-hard loyalist Reddy legislators, Bhumana Karunakar Reddy and Chevireddy Bhaskara Reddy. \u201cRoja might get the chance only when CM does not find suitable leaders from woman quota,\u201d said an insider. Roja is also one of the few fierce orators in the party and had faced humiliation including a year-long suspension from the assembly during TDP government.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

On November 8, 2018, the ruling Telugu Desam Party had issued a government order (GO) withdrawing the \"general consent\" accorded to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to carry out investigations and raids in the state.  \"In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, the government hereby withdraws the general consent accorded (in GO Ms 109) to all the members of the Delhi Special Police Establishment to exercise the powers and jurisdiction under the said Act in the state of Andhra Pradesh,\" the GO had said.  The then Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister (Home) N China Rajappa had said the reason to withdraw the consent was allegations against the top officials of the country's premier investigation agency.  The Andhra Pradesh government bestowed powers upon itself to launch a corruption probe against central government employees as well through the state's Anti-Corruption Bureau.  The YSR Congress Party that assumed power on May 30, issued a fresh order on Thursday cancelling the GO 176 issued on November 8.  Based on the directions of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, special chief secretary Manmohan Singh issued GO 81 to this effect.  \"The order issued on November 8, 2018 is hereby cancelled under the provisions of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946,\" it said.  The CBI will now have all powers to take up corruption and other cases in AP.  The premier investigative agency functions under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act.  Under Section 6 of the Act, a state government \"routinely\" grants consent to the CBI for exercising its authority in the state and the AP government, too, had issued relevant orders periodically.  Ever since he snapped ties with the Narendra Modi-led NDA government in March last year, Naidu had been alleging that the Centre was misusing agencies like the CBI to target political opponents.  The raids by Income Tax authorities on some business establishments, run by those close to the ruling Telugu Desam Party in the state, had left Naidu red-faced.  Subsequently, he announced that his government would not provide police cover to the IT officials for conducting the raids.  The state government's move was seen as further intensification of confrontation between the Modi government and Naidu, who was striving to forge a non-BJP front to take on the saffron party in 2019 Lok Sabha elections.  Opposition parties decried the move and asserted the state government did not have the authority to bar the CBI.  The YSR Congress, the main opposition party then, had alleged the controversial decision was taken only because the chief minister was scared of the CBI.

With focus on the farming sector, Jaganmohan Reddy\u2019s cabinet tried to please all with some sops that he had been promising to the people and had included in the election manifesto. Besides giving nod to the increase of wages to the Asha workers and clearing the Rythu Bharosa scheme of paying Rs 12,500 to each farmer towards input cost, the new cabinet also increased the wages for the sanitation workers to Rs 18,000, Anganwadi workers to Rs 11,500, mid-day meal workers to Rs 3,000, creation of calamity fund with Rs 2,000 crore corpus and creation of market stabilisation fund with Rs 3,000 crore. The Cabinet had also set the dates to start implementation of every programme, thus trying to create an impression that this government stands by its word. The cabinet had rolled out several benefits to the farmer and the farm sector. Besides clearing the Rythu Bharosa, which is to be implemented from October 15 and benefit over 50 lakh farmers. This fund would be paid directly into the bank accounts of the farmers without the banks adjusting it against the loans of the farmers. The government would hold talks with the commercial banks on this count and if they refuse and insist on taking the money towards repayment of the loans, the government would pay this money through the Primary Agriculture Committees (PACs). The government would also extend interest-free loans to the farmers. This scheme will be rolled out in the name of late YS Rajasekhar Reddy. The government would pay the interest to the banks and send the receipt to the farmers through village volunteers. The cabinet had also cleared the proposal to buy 200 rigs to drill bore wells free of cost to the farmers. One rig each will be placed in every Assembly and Parliament constituency. AP Rythu Commission would also be formed with chief minister as chairman. The committee would have agriculture experts and representatives of the farmers\u2019 associations and it would study the issues concerning the farmers and suggest remedies to the government. The poor would also get their 5 kilo rice every month delivered at their home by the village volunteers, which is now supplied through the fair price shops. The cabinet had decided to modernise 40,000 schools across the state providing basic and quality infrastructure. The cabinet had also given its nod to create AP Education Regulation Commission to ensure implementation of the Right to Education Act. It would insist on all private schools offering 25 per cent of its seats free to the poor. The Cabinet had decided to form a new sand policy avoiding influential people making money out of it and the government losing.

At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Samsung": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/heres-how-samsung-got-mocked-for-its-social-media-post/articleshow/69835890.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Jagan-Modi bonhomie a sign of closer ties at national level": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/jagan-modi-bonhomie-a-sign-of-closer-ties-at-national-level/articleshow/69720419.cms", "time": "", "description": "AMARAVATI: In what could be called a smart move of getting closer to the BJP leadership, YSRC chief and chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy accompanied Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Tirumala visit on Sunday. In signs of growing bonhomie between the two parties, Jagan extended full protocol courtesy to the PM on his visit to the temple town and received Modi, even though the PM was scheduled to address a public meeting, organized by the state BJP leadership, before his darshan. Though the YSRC was neither an ally of BJP in the elections nor part of NDA, Jagan is not losing any opportunity to come closer to the BJP leadership and secure sops to tackle a debt-hit state and empty coffers. He has already said before that he requires strong support from the Centre to tackle the empty coffers of the state. As CM, Jagan is keen on achieving big-ticket projects along with special category status with the support of Modi and BJP leadership to push his political rival N Chandrababu Naidu into a corner. Naidu\u2019s drubbing in the elections has made Jagan a new sensation on the national political stage, and a favourite among the BJP leadership as Naidu over-jealously worked with an agenda of dethroning Modi. Speculation is rife that Jagan might even consider joining the NDA after getting one or two sops cleared by the Centre. By decimating the BJP\u2019s rivals in the state \u2014TDP and Congress \u2014 Jagan seems to have won the hearts of BJP and is now eagerly waiting for the Centre to reciprocate. BJP, too, is not averse to hug Jagan as it might utilise YSRC\u2019s strength in the Lok Sabha as a cushion to off-load the pressures from its allies, like Shiv Sena and JD-U, which have already started flexing their muscles. Since YSRC emerged as the fourth-largest party in the Lok Sabha with 22 MPs, BJP might not hesitate to forge an alliance with it, if at all such an opportunity comes to its table. Such an alliance will make BJP more formidable in the southern plateau. In fact, Jagan rushed to New Delhi and met Modi immediately after winning the elections in the state. He held lengthy discussions with the PM and BJP chief Amit Shah, before taking over the reins of the state. Interestingly, Modi, while congratulating Jagan from a party-sponsored public meeting, assured to extend full support to his government in the state. Devotees at receiving end of VIP visitsHeavy security imposed in view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Tirupati left devotees stranded in Tirumala on Sunday. The temple city, which has been reeling under the impact of the heavy influx of pilgrims, saw a near-shutdown that restricted pilgrim movements for almost six hours. Though the PM arrived at Tirupati Airport at around 5:30 pm, Tirumala police and the TTD\u2019s vigilance and security wing sealed off entry and exit points at important congregation points as early as 3 pm, leaving pilgrims uncertain about exit routes. With barricades in and around the temple closed, pilgrims had great difficulty moving around Tirumala on Friday evening. Meanwhile, AP governor ESL Narasimhan, DGP D Gautam Sawang and National Human Rights Commission chairman HL Dattu offered prayers to Lord Venkateswara at the Tirumala temple on Sunday morning.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

In line with his electoral promise, Jaganmohan Reddy gave Cabinet berths to seven legislators from the backward classes, five from the Scheduled Castes, one each from the Scheduled Tribes and Muslims, and four each from the Kapu and the Reddy communities. The Kamma community, which dominated the previous Chandrababu Naidu Cabinet, got just one berth now. The Kshatriya and the Vysya communities also got one berth each. State Governor E S L Narasimhan administered the oath of office and secrecy to the new ministers at a glittering public function adjacent to the Secretariat at Velagapudi in capital Amaravati. The 26-member Cabinet, including the Chief Minister, has three women members; two from the Scheduled Castes and one from the Scheduled Tribes.

In fact, Balineni Srinivasa Reddy and Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose resigned from their Cabinet posts in the then Congress government and joined the YSRC floated by Jagan and have been sailing with him for the past eight years. Mopidevi Venkata Ramana Rao, while serving as minister in the then Kiran Kumar Reddy government, was arrested in connection with YSRC chief's disproportionate assets case in 2012 and jailed for several months. Jagan subsequently joined Ramana Rao in jail.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal.

He submitted his resignation to the council chairman, Mohammad Ahmad Shariff, who accepted it with immediate effect. Keshav quit his MLC post following his election to the legislative assembly from Uravakonda constituency in Anantapur district. Another TDP MLC, Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy, had quit his post before joining the YSR Congress in March. With Keshav\u2019s resignation, the assembly secretariat has officially declared two vacancies in the 58-member legislative council. Meanwhile, three sitting MLCs \u2014 two from the YSR Congress and one from the TDP \u2014 also contested the assembly elections and won. They are also expected to submit their resignations from the legislative council sometime this week, as the new assembly is likely to be convened for the swearing-in of members on June 12. The three MLCs who won the assembly elections include Kolagatla Veerabhadra Swamy from Vizianagaram and Alla Nani from Eluru (both YSR Congress), and Karanam Balaramakrishna Murthy from Chirala (TDP). Once the three quit, the legislative council will have five vacancies, for which elections will be held shortly. As Veerabhadra Swamy, Alla Nani and Karanam Balaram were elected to the council from MLA quota, the ruling YSR Congress, with a strength of 151 MLAs in the 175-member assembly, will grab the three posts without any problem. The other two \u2014 Payyavula Keshav and Magunta Srinivasula Reddy \u2014 were elected from local body constituencies of Anantapur and Prakasam districts, respectively. The two vacancies are to be filled by the local bodies and it is to be seen what happens next as the local bodies\u2019 terms expired a couple of months ago and new bodies are yet to be formed.
