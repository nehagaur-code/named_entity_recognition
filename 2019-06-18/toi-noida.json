At a meeting held at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday evening, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee told a team of 31 junior doctors, \" Lakkhi chhele, ebar tomra strike tule nao (Please withdraw your strike like good boys)\", which they agreed to. The \"cordial\" negotiations between the CM and doctors were broadcast live for about 100 minutes by two regional channels. The doctors, who had adopted a strident posture against the administration for the initial police inaction against the kin of a bereaved patient at NRS Hospital last Monday (incident that triggered the stir) relented in the face of genuine-sounding assurances from the CM. The state administration medical fraternity face-off escalated after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning of action against the strike during her visit to SSKM Hospital last Thursday. What could have also played on their minds was the rising public opinion against the continuing strike, especially after the CM's appeal for talks last weekend. The striking doctors returned to the NRS campus on Monday and, after another general-body meeting, made a statement: \"We hereby announce the withdrawal of the strike by junior doctors.\" Several issues were discussed at the meeting. They ranged from security measures - collapsible gates for emergency wards, regulated entry for patients' kin and enhanced police presence on medical campuses with nodal officers responsible for law and order - to the CM's suggestion for third-party PR professionals, who could act as grief counsellors and handle communication between \"overworked doctors\" and \"aggrieved patients' kin\" and grievance cells for patients. \"We are delighted with the cordial manner in which the meeting was held, the CM's caring touch and concrete suggestions and assurances to the issues raised by us,\" one of the junior doctors said. \"They (doctors) have genuine demands. We have listened to them and taken decisions to resolve them. This must be a continuous process. We have to see to it that such untoward incidents are averted and action is taken if something happens,\" Mamata said. The CM's \"gentleness\", however, came with the message that she could not be bullied. Urged by the junior doctors to visit the doctor who was injured in the NRS attack, and come to the NRS campus, she said, \"Leave certain things to us...Give me your word that you will resume duty.\" In Video:CM Mamata accepts proposal of doctors to set up Grievance Redressal CellDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."}, "Noida: Protest at ESIC as doctor \u2018slaps\u2019 official": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/protest-at-esic-as-doc-slaps-official/articleshow/69795942.cms", "time": "2019-06-15 09:26:00", "description": "NOIDA: Health services were disrupted at the ESIC hospital (Sector 24) for three hours on Friday after a doctor allegedly slapped an office staffer.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

An Indirapuram resident for the past seven years, the 38-year-old drives to Delhi, where his office is, every day. Yet last Friday, while returning from a late shift, he almost drove his car into a barricade on NH-9, a few hundred metres before the Noida Sector 62 crossing. It was dark and he saw the diversion late. There was no \u2018diversion ahead\u2019 warning. An Uber driver who does the Noida-Ghaziabad-Delhi circuit every day learnt the hard way that he could not trust his GPS on NH-9 like he does everywhere else. He likes the GPS because it gives him the shortest route. But recently, while taking passengers to Noida from Vaishali, the GPS pointed to an exit that brought him to a dead end. There was a mound of earth ahead. He said his passengers had warned him but he had insisted on following the map. Now, he just takes the advice because the highway is a maze. Changes are happening almost every day on NH-9, or Delhi-Meerut expressway, as the road gets widened and upgraded from UP Gate till the Dasna toll plaza and work picks up pace. The result is diversions, detours and closed turns, which are necessary because traffic cannot be stopped while the highway is being upgraded. But the complete absence of helping hands for traffic has drivers at a loss as to which way to turn. For instance, the original right turn into Noida from the highway, towards Labour Chowk, as one drives from Delhi is closed. A U-turn has been created a little further, but with no clear markers or personnel directing traffic, motorists have been left to figure it out on their own. It\u2019s the same for the new exits created on the Indirapuram side. The GPS can\u2019t keep pace with the changes, and unless one is familiar with the terrain, a motorist could easily miss an exit and end up taking a long detour, or worse, driving on the wrong side like many already do. This has led to the possibility of an accident shooting up. Regular commuters pointed out that when the Delhi portion of the highway \u2014 between Sarai Kale Khan and UP Gate \u2014 was being upgraded, similar diversions had to be made, but there were always a couple of traffic personnel posted at the diversions. This was very helpful, particularly at night, because traffic did not go stray. But as the construction machinery has moved into UP, the same standards are apparently not needed. Currently, between Kala Patthar in Indirapuram and Pratap Vihar, where the highway upgrade work is on in full swing, motorists have to negotiate about six diversions. The central verge is almost entirely dug up but not uniformly barricaded, so if motorists are not careful, they could slip into it. \u201cThe diversions are mostly marked with fluorescent strips, which during the daytime are useless and if you are not cautious enough, chances are there you might veer into the muddy track,\u201d said Abhishek Singh, a commuter. At night, there isn\u2019t enough light for these strips to glow, unless a strong headlight beam falls favourably on them. Mohan Mohanty, another commuter, points to another major problem caused by the lack of police oversight \u2014 autos and bikes diving between diversions and driving on the wrong side almost across the entire stretch, making driving difficult and often holding up traffic. \u201cAt Chajarsi cut, chances of a head-on collision are high,\u201d he says. The NHAI, which is in charge of the project, is aware of these problems but isn\u2019t promising any solutions, pointing out instead that work will be completed in four months. \u201cThis is a transition phase. We could possibly close down the stretch, nor could we stop work. Both have to go on simultaneously,\u201d said Mudit Mudgal, project engineer with NHAI. \u201cWe have done all we could do under the circumstances\u2026 at times, even workers are stationed at seemingly troublesome spots to manage traffic but it cannot be done at all times of the day.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/welcome-to-the-maze-called-nh-9/articleshow/69833485.cms", "time": "2019-06-18 09:06:00"}, "Ranveer Poses": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/ranveer-singh-and-harbhajan-singh-pose-for-some-super-cool/articleshow/69833663.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Unauthorised parking": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/unauthorisedparking/articleshow/65361137.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Bollywood actors who would be great teachers": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/bollywood-actors-who-would-be-great-teachers/photostory/65684334.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Sadhvi Pragya": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sadhvi-pragya-sparks-controversy-while-taking-oath/articleshow/69827039.cms", "time": "", "description": "NEW DELHI: BJP MP from Bhopal Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur created a controversy on the first day of 17th Lok Sabha on Monday when she suffixed the name of her spiritual guru with hers while taking oath, drawing objections from the opposition. Amid protests and shoutings, Thakur said that it was her full name and she had already mentioned it in the form she had filled for oath taking. The mention of Swami Purna Chetnanand Avdheshanand Giri as suffix to her name evoked sharp reaction from the opposition members who said that such a thing was not permitted. She insisted that the suffix was part of her full name, resulting in an uproar from opposition and slogan shouting in her favour from the ruling benches. Following the din, Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar asked the Lok Sabha secretary general about Pragya's full name. Amid noise and objections, Kumar ruled that only the name written in her election certificate issued by the returning officer would go on record. Thakur, the Malegaon blast accused, took oath in Sanskrit and ended it with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogan. Thakur defeated Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh to enter the Lok Sabha for the first time. Later, BJP members continued to raise 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' slogans, teasing the opposition. They started raising slogan after oath taking by every BJP member. After Ganjendra Umarao Singh Patel (BJP) completed his oath with 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai', N K Premchandran (RSP) urged the Pro tem Speaker to maintain the prescribed format of the oath. The Pro tem speaker ruled that the members stick to the format provided. After this, the members of BJP started adding 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' after end of every oath.

Everyone in America knew what happened,\u201d explained the photographer. It\u2019s not as if ice hockey was a popular game in the US but such was the hype for the game \u2013 played at the height of the Cold War \u2013 that even Americans who had never watched ice hockey before or didn\u2019t even know the rules tuned in for it. Many Indians would find this scenario familiar. Because today, they will do the same as India and Pakistan face off in an epic Cricket World Cup game (unless the rain has other plans). Cricket might be a religion in India, but there still are plenty of atheists around, many of whom don\u2019t even understand cricket, let alone follow it. And they only end their aversion to the game on one particular occasion \u2013 when India plays Pakistan. The reasons range from peer pressure to a heightened sense of patriotism and even adherence to social decorum. \u2018Cricket-crazy family leaves me no choice\u2019Vamini Sethi, management consultant, 33, GurgaonI will watch the game as my cricket-crazy family will leave me with no choice. It will be on TV all day and all the discussions in the house will be about the match. I don\u2019t follow cricket because I find it too time-consuming and overhyped. There are other sports like hockey, kabaddi that bring glory to our country but go unnoticed. I have nothing against the game; it brings the entire nation together. But it has so many fans, I\u2019m sure it can do with one less. \u2018Don\u2019t usually have time to watch cricket, but will make time today\u2019Ashvarya Sharma, homemaker, 52, DelhiIt\u2019s not that I hate cricket but since I am a homemaker, I have to keep running around doing chores and can\u2019t spend the whole day sitting and watching cricket. But TV pe bhi toh wahi chalta hai din bhar toh dekhna hi padta hai. However, the India-Pakistan game is different. I watch it by choice. It\u2019s not just cricket; it\u2019s almost war-like. The sentiment is different. In fact, today I plan to finish my chores early. Kitchen ki bhi chutti hai uss din. I don't miss a single ball of any India-Pakistan match. \u2018Will watch the match because it is the patriotic thing to do\u2019Ananya Pandey, communication professional, 29, DelhiI really never had anyone in my family who was an ardent cricket fan or watched it for fun, so I never found any company to watch the game or develop a taste for it. The last game I watched was the 2011 World Cup final that India won. I watched because it was a special occasion and it felt like the patriotic thing to do. Similarly, I will watch the India-Pakistan match today because it\u2019s a different rush altogether. As clich\u00e9d as it may sound, as an Indian, any Indo-Pak discussion catches my attention. Specially post the Pulwama attack and the increasing political tensions, I\u2019d like to see how this tension will affect the performances of both the teams. Also, on a lighter note, my boss \u2013 a die-hard cricket fan \u2013 has instructed me to watch this match and cheer for India. 'After balakot strike, anything India-Pak will attract me'Rajat Kothari, banker, 38, NoidaI don\u2019t follow cricket but an India-Pakistan game is not cricket. I don\u2019t understand the rules and the jargon of cricket and prefer football, to be honest. At least, it\u2019s played by more than a dozen countries in the world. But when I will sit with my friends and family to watch the game today, I won\u2019t be watching cricket, I feel I will be supporting India against Pakistan, on all fronts. After the skirmishes recently and the Balakot Air Strike, the atmosphere is such that anything India-Pakistan will attract my attention. This will be my first ever cricket match and I hope India wins. \u2018The only way to socialise today\u2019Ishita Mathur, teacher, 22, GhaziabadI will watch it because it\u2019s a great way to socialise. Today, cricket will be the only topic of conversation. It just doesn\u2019t seem right to ignore that or not be a part of the discourse. So, I will join my family in front of the TV today and watch the game. The reason I don\u2019t watch cricket is because I find it boring. I prefer other team sports like football and basketball. They seem more participative and active. In cricket, it seems only the bowler and batsmen are doing something at a given time while the others are passively involved. 'Flatmates will suck me into the frenzy'Tsering Tashi, research scholar, 29, DelhiI will have to watch it. What else do you do when everyone around you is crazy about it? I live in a flat with three other cricket-crazy boys and they will watch the game. So, I will be party to the frenzy. I grew up watching and playing football and for me, that is the beautiful game. Cricket is just a colonial hangover, not a sport. I have managed to avoid all the other India matches in the World Cup so far but the hype around the India-Pakistan match is such that you get sucked into the maelstrom somehow.

In a separate meeting with developers, the CM said there was a huge trust deficit between buyers and realtors and steps needed to be taken to bridge this large gulf. The CM expressed dissatisfaction that the pace of work to deliver delayed homes was still not what he wanted. \u201cHomebuyers who have invested their life savings are running from pillar to post. They have been cheated. The government will take no decision that harms the interests of the common man,\u201d said an official statement, quoting the CM.

Buyers of homes promised by the troubled trio of Jaypee, Amrapali and Unitech and several other delayed projects were present at the meeting. Homebuyers of Amrapali have for long been demanding a stress fund to help complete the flats. Jaypee Infratech, which is going through the insolvency resolution process, has a takeover offer from state firm NBCC but the proposal has repeatedly failed to pass at the committee of creditors (CoC)meetings.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

The committee, which recently surveyed Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Nodia, has dubbed the Hindon a \u201cdead river\u201d that has a dissolved oxygen level of almost zero. The team also visited 23 industries and government hospitals in Ghaziabad and noted that hardly any of them were adhering to environmental norms. In its report, the committee has said that \u201cup to 35-40% patients coming to these medical colleges and hospitals may be infected and they are prone to suffer from variety of diseases like cancer, asthma, collitis and other alike water and air-borne diseases\u201d. On pollution in the Hindon, the committee has said that government agencies have turned a blind eye on illegal colonies that have mushroomed around waterbodies. \u201cWe have issued directives to the administration of these three districts to initiate a demolition drive in the river catchment area,\u201d said Rajendera Singh, general secretary of the NGT committee. In Ghaziabad, the committee found that eight major drains \u2014 Jwala drain, Arthala drain, Kaila Bhatta drain, Indirapuram drain, Dasna drain, Pratap Vihar drain, Karheda drain and Hindon Vihar drain \u2014 were discharging untreated sewage in the Hindon. \u201cNo STP/ETP has been connected to treat the entire sewage, in consequence thereof, the entire city of Ghaziabad is polluting river Hindon with untreated sewage,\u201d the report said. The team also noted that industries were not adhering to environmental norms. \u201cOf the 20-plus industries we inspected, except for Honda industry, no other industry meets the environmental norms. Even those industries that have installed STP/ETP often bypass their effluents and discharge it directly into drains, which ultimately find their way into the Hindon river,\u201d said Singh, who added that a detailed report on the committee\u2019s findings is being prepared and will be released shortly. City-based environmentalist Sushil Raghav said that in July last year, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had carried out a survey to ascertain the level of groundwater and surface water contamination around the Hindon. \u201cGroundwater samples were analysed for parameters such as fluoride, sulphate, oil and grease and heavy metals. The report revealed that 93 of 168 groundwater sampling locations in Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur and Shamli are contaminated with one or more parameters and exceeded BIS drinking water specifications,\u201d said Raghav. \u201cWhat the committee is saying is nothing new, but despite such damning report and observations, no one is really interested in the river,\u201d he added. Hindon, also known as Harnadi, is a rain-fed river that originates from Saharanpur and flows through Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Baghpat and Ghaziabad before emptying into the Yamuna. Due to the high levels of pollution, Hindon has earned the status of \u201cdead river\u201d and its water declared \u201cunfit\u201d even for bathing.

If implemented, this will lead to a steep increase in power bills \u2014 a monthly bill of, say, Rs 3,000 will rise to around Rs 4,000. In the tariff proposal submitted to UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC), UPPCL has recommended the highest increase of 26% in the lowest slab of 0-150 units, raising it from Rs 4.90 per unit to Rs 6.20. The tariff for the 151-300 units slab is proposed to be hiked from Rs 5.40 to Rs 6.50 per unit. Similarly, urban households consuming 301 to 500 units per month will have to shell out Rs 7 per unit instead of Rs 6.20, and those with consumption higher than 500 units will have to pay Rs 7.50 per unit. Sources in UPERC said there will be a public hearing and, as per procedure, a public notice will be issued inviting objections from people. Principal secretary (energy) Alok Kumar said the hike was proposed in view of the rise in input cost of power. \u201cThere has been an increase in the cost of coal and fuel. The cost of maintaining transmission and generation infrastructure has also gone up,\u201d he told TOI. The last power tariff hike of around 12% was implemented in 2017, six months after BJP stormed to power in UP with an overwhelming majority. There was no tariff hike in 2018. Not surprisingly, the proposed hike has raised hackles of consumers. UP Rajya Upbhogta Parishad president A K Verma said that proposed hike was extremely high. \u201cThe power corporation has been putting the burden on consumers to hide its own inefficiency,\u201d he said. In NCR, where people already pay steep electricity bills because of the high cost of power backup, residents said an exception should be made for Noida since it is a \u201cprofit centre\u201d. Residents\u2019 body representatives pointed out there was 100% recovery of electricity bills from Noida and hardly any line losses as compared to other cities. \u201cThe department recovers 100% electricity charges in Noida and the line losses are hardly 5-7% as compared to over 30% in many other cities of UP. Noida is a profit-making centre and an increase in charges will be completely unjustified,\u201d said A N Dhawan, secretary general of FONRWA, the umbrella body of RWAs in the city. He also said FONRWA had already written to the UPERC to declare Noida a profit centre and reduce tariff. \u201cThe power department is already unable to provide the required amount of electricity in Noida, while there is full recovery and good revenue from here.

According to the order, there are different committees on air pollution, water pollution, plastic management, waste disposal and management, plantation and others that need to be handled by a single authority and will be merged with this committee. The district magistrate will head the team that will include the heads of all related departments and the divisional forest officer will be the member secretary. \u201cAir pollution and waste management are some of the priority issues in Gautam Budh Nagar as we are part of NCR located close to Delhi.

This step towards integration is expected to reduce delays in the implementation and improve coordination towards environmental conservation, he added. Uttar Pradesh has 15 cities with severely polluted air, nine critically and seriously polluted industrial clusters and riverbeds of 12 major rivers in the critically polluted category, according to the government order. This is according to the Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) scores developed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Other UP cities in the list include Ghaziabad, Baghpat, Hapur, Muzaffarnagar, Kanpur and Agra, among others. The new monitoring committee is expected to look into all land, air and water pollution related problems and maintain transparency. A web portal, UP Environmental Compliance Portal, will also be set up by the state pollution control board where all complaints and problems will regularly be updated and NGT orders will also be published. \u201cThere is insufficient infrastructure in the state for solid waste and e-waste management, also medical waste, plastic and C&D waste management is also not satisfactory. This is why it was important to have a monitoring authority in every district,\u201d states the government order. According to officials, the departments will fix an agenda that will be discussed, and its progress will be reviewed in the monthly meeting. A report will also be submitted by every district every three months. At the state level, monitoring will be done by four issue-specific committees \u2014 implementation committee, river rejuvenation committee, air quality monitoring committee and state level solid waste management monitoring committee. \u201cWe have already taken many steps for pollution management and improving green cover in the district.

The protests came on a day the Gautam Budh Nagar district was felicitated by the UP government for collecting around Rs 14.8 crore in power revenue between October last year and this March, the highest in the state during the period. The district was followed by Ferozabad at Rs 9.6 crore and Mainpuri, which collected Rs 9.3 crore in the same period. GB Nagar\u2019s overall collection of power revenue for the financial year 2018-19 was also at an all-time high of Rs 103 crore, in comparison to Rs 64 crore collected in 2017-18. District magistrate BN Singh was felicitated with a gold certificate by chief secretary Anup Chandra Pandey for the highest revenue collection. \u201cCollection of revenue from power has been maximum at Rs 103 crore for the financial year 2018-19, as against Rs 64 crore in 2017-18. This award is in recognition of such steep collection,\u201d said Singh, the district magistrate. Residents, however, protested the plan to increase tariff and called for an upgrade in power infrastructure. \u201cWe welcome the felicitation of the district for collecting the highest revenue. But we are completely opposed to the proposed 20% hike in power tariff for the simple reason that we have been facing long outages of late in Noida and Greater Noida. There has been lack of upgraded infrastructure and accountability on the part of the power department in the district. Despite paying hefty bills, we are facing 4-8 hours of power cuts every day. How can a tariff hike be justified in a situation where the power department is unable to provide regular supply?\u201d asked NP Singh, president of the Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA). Apart from the 20% increase in power tariff across slabs, the UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) has also suggested a hike in the fixed charge from Rs 90 per KW to Rs 110. If implemented, this will lead to a steep increase in power bills \u2014 a monthly bill of, say, Rs 3,000 will rise to around Rs 4,000. In the tariff proposal submitted to UP Electricity Regulatory Commission, UPPCL has recommended the highest increase of 26% in the lowest slab of 0-150 units, raising it from Rs 4.90 per unit to Rs 6.20. The tariff for the 151-300 units slab is proposed to be hiked from Rs 5.40 to Rs 6.50 per unit. According to the RWA federation president, the hike is all the more unjustified in a district that pays the highest revenue and steep electricity bills. \u201cNoida is a \u2018no power cut zone\u2019, which is required for promotion of industry. It\u2019s also an area which provides the maximum revenue. Then, why should it be subjected to a tariff hike? We oppose the proposal and will take up the matter with chief minister Yogi Adityanath. We will approach Prime Minister Narendra Modi, if needed,\u201d said NP Singh. Greater Noida resident Alok Kumar suggested that the power department should instead focus on laying underground cables, upgrading old transformers, replacing rusting poles, panel boxes and increasing load capacities of substations. \u201cWe congratulate the district magistrate for the felicitation in revenue collection, but strongly oppose the hike in tariff,\u201d said Kumar. District magistrate Singh maintained that the hike was in the proposal stage. \u201cThe tariff hike proposal pertains to the power department. Residents should raise their concerns regarding tariff etc with them or the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Committee. It does not fall under my jurisdiction,\u201d said Singh, adding that he was only authorised for revenue collection.

Officials said this would not only generate a source of income for villagers, but also expand green cover in the district. As of now, the project has been planned for 88 villages. The officials said there was a growing demand for timber because of an expanding realty market and allowing it to be grown legally was the best way to meet the requirement. The trees that they are being encouraged to plant take almost 10 years to mature and their wood fetches good returns. \u201cWe are starting a series of informative and interactive sessions in villages of the district where we will inform villagers how to put their vacant land to use and grow trees as a mode of investment.

Formed about 18 years ago for the development of Taj Expressway, YEIDA Master Plan 2031 entails that the Yamuna Expressway area which consists of 24,739 hectares as urban area will have 4,569 hectares (19%) reserved for residential purposes, 4,698 hectares for industrial (26%) and 5,148 hectares (22%) for a green cover. Apart from the new city, some 29 of 334 villages of Gautam Budh Nagar, Mathura, Agra, Mahamaya Nagar (Hathras), Bulandshahar and Aligarh that are notified under YEIDA, will be developed as smart villages, with all urban civic facilities, including sewage, drainage, roads, drinking water, electricity, optical fiber for telephone and cable connectivity etc, in the next three years, starting with 10 villages in this financial year. \u201cThese 10 villages will be developed at a cost of Rs 80 crore (Rs 8 crore per village) in the current financial year.

While Bhati surrendered before a local court last week, police said they are now on the lookout for the absconding directors. Bhati floated a Ponzi scheme under the name Bike Bot, and allegedly netted a whopping 2.5 lakh investors within a few months. Of the 10 new complainants, all from Rajasthan, five have alleged that they were duped of over Rs 3 crore by the company, with only one instalment of the promised Rs 9,756 per month being deposited in their account. These fresh complaints, cops said, will be clubbed with the existing FIRs, over 30, against Bhati and others that are being probed by a special investigative team (SIT).

When Bhati arrived on the premises of the SSP\u2019s office in a police vehicle on Thursday, angry words were exchanged between him and some investors who had gathered there. Bhati had surrendered in court on June 7 while police were addressing a press conference about the arrest of the company\u2019s franchise head Vijay Kasana. Kasana was arrested after some investors informed police he had met with an accident and was admitted at a private hospital in Meerut. Bike Bot was floated as an enterprise with an app of the same name under the parent company, Garvit Innovative Promoters, in 2017. It sought a one-time investment of Rs 65,100 from investors, offering monthly returns of Rs 9,765. The money, investors were told, would come from revenue generated by bike taxis affiliated to Bike Bot in various cities. The scam came to light when the Bike Bot began defaulting on returns in 2018. Bhati, formerly associated with BSP, and other officials of Bike Bot had been on the run for six months before he surrendered. BSP too distanced itself from him after allegations of cheating cropped up.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The duo used a modus operandi similar to that used in the Bike Bot scam, they said. The victim alleged that he was asked to invest a minimum sum of Rs 62,000 in an electronic taxi aggregator business \u2014 \u2018Go Way\u2019. He was promised Rs 10,000 every month for one year. However, no money was sent to his account even after investing Rs 8.6 lakh. The police were informed on Sunday when the victims staged a protest outside the company office on Sunday. Anil Sen (40) and Meenu(35) from Greater Noida had their office at GNS Plaza, Site 4 in Kasna. Deepesh Sharma, a local businessman from Bulandshahr, told the police that he came in contact with the couple 20 days ago. \u201cOne of my relatives introduced me to the scheme. I then met the couple when they showed me a few electric cars and scooters. The accused said they plan to bring these on road as taxis,\u201d said Sharma. The complainant added that he invested Rs 8.6 lakh in the scheme and introduced his family members as investors. \u201cThe scheme appeared good to me. They offered double returns in one year so I invested a good amount. However, as soon as my cheques got encashed, they stopped taking my calls and switched off their mobile phones,\u201d Sharma alleged in the complaint. He alleged that the company has around 5,000 investors, who lost their money. \u201cI am filing a complaint to call out to other investors,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the police have registered a case under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC. \u201cWe are investigating other details of the case along with the total number of investors duped.

Beautiful decorations with flowers were the main attraction at the event 'Over 85 stalls at the event offered everything that one needs to set up a garden'Manju Grover, General Secretary, The Floriculture Society, Noida, and a resident of Sector 12, said, \"Keeping in mind the deteriorating air quality, the aim of the 32nd edition of the flower show was to spread awareness about water conservation and anti-pollution plants. From plants to colourful pots and manure, seeds and gardening accessories \u2013 over 85 stalls at the event offered everything that one needs to set up a garden. The anti-pollution plants like jade, money plant, spider plant, dracaena and snake plant were quite in demand. Noida Authority also directed Noidawallahs, plant sellers and exhibitors not to use plastic vase for plants.\"  The visitors did not shy away from capturing the beauty in camera stills 'Small potted plants among the hot sellers' Talking about her observations about the current trends among Noidawallahs, Manju told us, \"The trend of gifting plants has grown, so, small potted plants ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 500 were some of the hot sellers.

Visitors took home a lot of vegetable and flower seedlings, which were priced between Rs 8 to Rs 10.

For instance, a lot of Noidawallahs have started going back to nature. A lot of people want to understand about different ways of developing an organic garden.

Officials said that while metro corporations run training programmes for employees, they are not able to get trained manpower, as no specialised courses are available in the country that train students for metro operations. Most metro staff members from across the country are trained, after they are hired, either at the DMRC training centre in Delhi or Namma metro centre in Bangalore. \u201cWe spend almost a year training our staff in the various metro operations because there is no metro specialisation available for students in the country. We get railway engineers and others from IT, communications and other streams and then train them. The new course will benefit us and several other metro networks that are being developed,\u201d said P D Upadhyay, the executive director, NMRC. With metro rail operational in 12 cities, and several others at construction stage, the university hopes that there will be increased demand for trained employees. Nearly 600 km of sanctioned metro lines is under construction and is expected to be ready in the next five years, according to the Government of India. There are about 1,000 km of metro line proposals under planning. \u201cWe have held round tables with various metro corporations and private infrastructure companies and realised that there is a huge gap in the demand and supply for engineers trained in metro operations. Most metro systems initially higher engineers from outside the country for starting the system. Therefore, we have decided to introduce a new course this year for MTech in railway signalling, telecom and reliability availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS),\u201d said B P Sharma, vice chancellor, GBU. He added that the course will focus on metro operations in each module and a separate certificate for it will also be given at the end of the course. The syllabus, possible modules and other structures have been developed in consultation with various metro rail corporations. Additionally, a four-week summer internship will also be conducted for students with practical training at the NMRC stations. \u201cThere are hardly any colleges that provide training in RAMS and nobody gives special training for metro. Most students who take up RAMS and railway engineering move to countries like Saudi Arabia and work for the metro system there. The new course will help supply trained officials for metro systems in India,\u201d said Vidushi Sharma, a member of GBU\u2019s joint consultative committee on Centre for rapid alternative energy and mobility. The NMRC is helping with developing the course structure and providing faculty from within the industry. Most of the trainers and teachers will be retired or working officials.. \u201cThe NMRC will also help with providing on-the-job training to the students at its metro stations and depots. Our senior staff members will teach the students,\u201d Upadhyay said. An agreement will be signed between GBU and NMRC within a week, officials said. The NMRC already has a staff strength of about 690 and will need another 200 employees in the next six months because of the ongoing expansion work.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

Announcing the decision, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, \"BJP won several elections under leadership of Amit Shah. But since PM appointed him home minister, Amit Shah himself said the responsibility of party president should be given to someone else. BJP Parliamentary board has selected JP Nadda as working president.\" Modi and other parliamentary board members including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Thawar Chand Gehlot and senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramlal greeted Nadda after his selection as party working president. Hailing from Himachal, Nadda (58) has held several organisational posts at the national and state level. This will be the first time the party has appointed a working president. After considerable discussion it was decided that Shah's continuance would be required in view of important state elections coming up and the party also announced a membership drive and organisational elections that will keep cadre busy for several months. Singh said Nadda will remain the working president till BJP's membership drive and organisational elections are over. Process of the organisational elections has already begun as state unit elections are likely next month. As per procedure, it takes four-five months to complete the entire organisational elections. Singh said the parliamentary board wanted that Shah should look after the party as president until organisational elections of the party are completed. \"However, Amit Shah himself urged that as home minister, he can't do justice with responsibilities as party chief and wanted someone to take over after which the parliamentary board unanimously selected Nadda as working president,\" Singh said. Nadda was mentioned as a likely party chief in 2014 when Rajnath Singh resigned after joining the Union ministry. However, Shah took over as party president. Nadda has long experience of the party organisation as he was the in-charge of the party headquarters and is a popular figure.

His remarks at the start of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha echo his announcement on Sunday of a meeting of leaders of all parties and an informal interaction of MPs, in what is seen as a bid to break the ice after a bitter poll campaign. \"The opposition should stop worrying about numbers. The people have given them a certain number. Every word of the opposition is important. When it comes to Parliament, we should forget the ruling side and opposition. We should think of issues with a nishpaksh spirit,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister said an active and effective opposition is a necessity in a democracy and pointed out that a well- argued and factual criticism of the government strengthens democracy. \"Sometimes such positive contributions are not noticed as they do not get high TRPs,\" he said. Though he did not mention the media, he said highlighting such efforts would strengthen the functioning of Parliament. Modi noted that the recent elections have yielded several firsts such as the highest number of voters exercising their franchise since Independence, a high number of women voters and a higher representation for women in Parliament. \"It is also after several decades that a government has been re-elected with a bigger majority,\" he said. Referring to his recent speeches, the Prime Minister said that \"we started with ' sab ka saath, sab ka vikas', but the people have added an unprecedented 'vishwas' (trust) to the matter\".

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

But the new-age dads, who stay in nuclear as well as joint families, where both husband and wife are working, are not only dividing the task of raising kids equally, but also making sure that they are available for their kids for a heart-to-heart conversation, advice on friendships, or period talks. From taking leaves for kids\u2019 exams to cooking and helping them with homework \u2013 things that one would typically expect a mother would do \u2013 are being done by dads quite well, who believe in not just sharing finances, but other responsibilities, too. On Father\u2019s Day, we speak to some dads and mothers leading by example, who tell us about the stereotypes that fathers are subjected to, and how they are breaking them and contributing as an equal parent. Dads not emotional, says who?Ankur Gupta, a doctor and resident of Sector 50, Gurgaon, says, \u201cFathers are not sensitive, kids turn to their mothers if they want to express their feelings; fathers are messy, don\u2019t help in household chores; they are not interested in school grades, and are uncomfortable in parent-teacher meetings \u2013 these are some common stereotypes that most fathers in India are subjected to. Thankfully, these are not applicable to me as at a very early age my daughter realised that she could walk up to me and talk about anything that is bothering her emotionally. I am also interested in knowing about what is happening in her school. There is no division of labour at our home but my wife and I know about the things we are good at, so we take the lead accordingly. I know I am good at language and my wife can manage the finances well, so it is like an unsaid rule that we follow to help our family in that way.\u201d Tilak Chowdhury, a resident of Sector 169, Noida, who works at a consulting firm, adds, \u201cThe stereotypes are not restricted to just, dads can\u2019t cook or look after the kids, often, they are also considered very strict and someone who cannot have fun, or show any emotion in front of their kids. Why can\u2019t people expect a father to be like Anupam Kher\u2019s character in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge who can encourage his kids when they fail, or do not perform well in studies, or can discuss their love lives openly like Rishi Kapoor\u2019s character in Hum Tum?\u201d Can\u2019t discuss heartbreaks with dads \u2013 seriously? You cannot discuss problems related to heartbreaks or seek advice after a fight with friends with your father as they won\u2019t understand them \u2013 new-age dads are trying to break this stereotype. \u201cWe understand and can give useful advice to the kids. Why do people find it so difficult to accept that fathers can also have emotions and kids can have a conversation with us on topics related to heartbreaks or can seek any other emotional advice? I have always been available to my kids whenever they have wanted me. I remember that my elder daughter, now 15, would return disturbed from school. One day, I asked her about what was bothering her as I was concerned. I did not mean to interfere in her personal life, but I told her that she could come up to me whenever she was comfortable talk about it, and I would try to help her in all my capacity. It took her two days to tell me that she was facing problems with a friend, who would often fight with her on petty issues. I told her that it was important to focus on the friendship if it was important to them, they can fight over petty issues but school days won\u2019t come back. We started with this topic and then she opened up about her school life and her friends from the neighbourhood. I was glad that she could tell me everything. That day, my daughter understood that she can discuss her problems with me and I will try to help her,\u201d shares Arjun Singh, a businessman who lives in Rajouri Garden and father to two teenage daughters. Arpana Prakash, who runs a dance school, adds, \u201cWhen I asked my seven-year-old daughter about who would she first tell about her boyfriend, and she said, \u2018Dad.\u2019 That is the comfort level that they share. We could never think about having a talk about menstruation with our fathers but today\u2019s generation surely can.\u201d \u2018Can take care of kids and deal with clients\u2019Raj Hazarika says that he is often asked why he willingly contributes as a homemaker. \u201cThis is something that they expect a woman to do but I like cooking and also enjoy doing it for my kids. Playing, cooking or just being with my kids is important as they are growing up, and this time will never come back. Raising kids is not an easy task, and there is nothing wrong in being equally involved with your partner in doing so. One has to adjust a lot while dealing with kids. I can manage my clients or colleagues easily but dealing with kids and their temperament is another thing \u2013 something that every parent should learn hands- on,\u201d says Raj, a resident of Sushant Lok 2 who runs a coaching academy. For some, it is also a way to bond with their kids. \u201cMy wife is a teacher and she leaves around 6.30am, so I wake up early before my kids leave for school and pack their lunch. I leave for work around 10am, so I have enough time to spend with my kids. We both are working parents, so I don\u2019t see it as a problem that I am cooking for my kids. When I come from work, my kids are often asleep because my wife is with them after school and helps them with the homework. If I have my Saturdays off, then I help them with their homework or extra-curricular activities but that is something I want to do as a parent, and not because somebody is forcing me to. People can think that I am too involved in my family but I am doing this because this is what I want to do,\u201d says Roshan Sharma, a resident of Saket, who works as a consultant in a firm.
