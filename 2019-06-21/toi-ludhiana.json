The action plan has given major thrust on the timely completion of common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) and upgrade of sewage treatment plants (STPs). Members have also demanded closure of illegal points from where effluents or domestic sewage are released in the drain. The members suggested that all CETPs should be completed at the earliest and treated water should be sent back to industries for re-use. The suggestions also included new STPs to tap illegal disposal of domestic sewage waste in Buddha Nullah, use of treated water from STPs for irrigation purposes and formation of Special Task Force comprising central officials as well as local professionals, ecologists to monitor the progress. Kapil Arora, a city-based engineer and a consultant with Naroa Punjab Manch, said they have suggested identification and disconnection of all illegal connections laid down by dyeing industries and dairies to throw untreated industrial effluents and animal excreta in Buddha Nullah. The electricity connection of any industry/dairies must be disconnected and it should be banned forever, the NGOs have demanded. The NGOs have suggested construction of two dairy complexes, one at Hambran Road and another at Tajpur Road with facilities like biogas plant by PEDA and solar energy operated plant for drying and conversion of animal excreta into wooden logged shaped fuel with at least double the capacity of dairies at present. The high-resolution cameras (day and night vision) must be installed along Buddha Nullah as well as in industrial area/dairy complexes to keep a check on dumping of solid waste as well as disposal of untreated effluents in the drain. All the submersible pumps installed by industries and dairies on Tajpur Road must be closed with solid material so as to stop seeping of industrial water into groundwater. The water supply to residents of Ludhiana must also be restricted and through water meters only, the members have suggested. After listening to the issues, the minister said he too is affected with the problem as he belongs to Rajasthan and owns land in Sri Ganganagar. The matter will be taken up as soon as possible and further they will get the present status of all ongoing cases in courts as well as with NGT, he said. He said contamination of water is a serious crime and it will be taken up to provide relief to both the states, but the state governments must also act positively in this direction to eradicate the problem.

Usually, area councillors or other political persons ask civic officials to lift garbage collected in plots, and the civic body bears the expenses. In the meeting of the Finance and Contracts Committee (F&CC), members will take a decision in this regard on Thursday. It has been proposed that the owner of that vacant plot should pay service charges to the civic body. For cleaning, the 200 square yards of plot, the owner would be asked to pay Rs5,000; for 500 square yards plot, it would be Rs10,000; and above 500 square yards, the amount would be Rs25,000. Last year, MC had issued a public notice to residents not to throw garbage in vacant plots, and if such a thing happened, then the owners would have to get the plot cleaned within three days. Also, owners had to ensure garbage was not thrown inside the plots again. However, the warning went unnoticed because after that, civic officials did not conduct any checking in the areas. Roughly, there are over 30,000 vacant plots in the city, and officials blamed lack of staff for not conducting checkings at the ground level. However, it is now proposed that MC should recover charges from the owner, because when they clean the plots, the fuel, machinery, and energy of employees is used. It is to be seen whether F&CC members approve this agenda or not. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said the meeting would take place on Thursday, and the proposal would be discussed with members, after which approval would be given. On the other hand, residents claimed MC had the right to impose penalty only if they were providing facilities. Haibowal resident Harish Batra said: \u201cThere is no facility of door-to-door garbage lifting in the entire city, and private garbage collectors are taking away garbage. But they do not come regularly, so people have to throw garbage inside plots.\u201d A Maya Nagar resident said: \u201cThe owner should not be held responsible for garbage in his plot, as he is not asking people to throw garbage there. It is the responsibility of civic officials to check such people who are throwing garbage wherever they feel like.\u201d PROPOSED RATES * Plot within 200sq yards: Rs5,000 * Plot from 200-500 sq yards: Rs10,000 * Plot above 500sq yards: Rs25,000 Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Post inquiry, panel recommends action against docs, nurses on duty": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/post-inquiry-panel-recommends-action-against-docs-nurses-on-duty/articleshow/69849553.cms", "time": "2019-06-19 07:19:00", "description": "Ludhiana: After an enquiry report on the orders of the civil surgeon, a board was constituted to enquire the treatment of a patient, Ramandeep Kaur, 27, from Rajgarh Tehsil village, Raikot, whose kin helped her deliver a pre-mature baby.

Six visually handicapped youngsters went to a camp in Bengaluru from June 10 to 19. This camp was organized by private institution Cabi (Cricket Association for the Blind in India), which is the apex body conducting cricket for the blind across India, having inherited the responsibility in 2010 from the former Association of Cricket for the Blind in India. \"Cricket is an emotion for me, and I am very much blessed that the experience in the last days of the camp was unmatchable and indescribable. It\u2019s my first time being a part of this camp, and I felt really good, as I have learnt a lot of things in cricket, which will help me in the future. I am really thankful to Cabi who organizes such camps for people like us. It gives us hope and courage, that even though we are blind, people are coming forward and understanding our needs,\u201d said Rohit (19) from Ludhiana. Vishal (22), also from the city, said: \u201cI was always fond of cricket, and being in this kind of camp gives me extra hope and courage that I can be a good sportsman. Here, I have practised batting, bowling, and fielding. In the past few days, I have seen a positive change in me, as I know I am better at all these activities because of my hard work and dedication. It's my first time in Bangalore, and I am really happy, and wish to be here next year also, to learn some new techniques and things which will help me in the future.\u201d \u201cThe weather in Bengaluru makes me energetic, as from the first day itself, I was feeling very good. The daily routine there started in the early morning, where all our mates get ready for practice. The sessions start from 10am and end at 4.30pm. Believe me while we practise and play, I don\u2019t think about anything else. It\u2019s the best feeling, and one of the best moments of my life,\u201d said Jagseer Singh (18) from Ludhiana.

I will miss these days and moments.\u201d Mandeep Singh (21), another city lad, said: \u201cIt took us about two days in the train, but it was worth the wait, as I was going to learn some new tips and tricks which will improve my game. Everything in the southern city was so well organized and it felt so good just being there. We used to have breakfast in the morning around 7.30am, lunch between 1-2 pm, and finally dinner every night at 8pm. Every person there was working with so much cooperation, which made me feel I was at home itself. I improved my skills in fielding and bowling, which I wanted to improve for a very long time.\u201d \u201cAlthough this camp was about cricket, there was another special thing which I personally felt good about, and that was we also had computer classes. I always wanted to try computers, and so I learnt many things here which will help me in future. It was necessary to learn these things like booking an airplane ticket, bus ticket, train ticket, movie ticket, etc. They also taught us how to use tablets. There was a one-hour class from 5-6pm, after the cricket practice. Our days there were full of learning and joy. It was my first time in that place, but I am sure I will come next time too,\u201d said Sandeep Kumar (22) from Ludhiana.

Taxation professionals had protested outside the office of the assistant excise and taxation commissioner (AETC), SK Garg, on Wednesday, claiming that he was not doing any of their works, and was delaying GST refunds deliberately. Shortly after this, the ETO Association issued a statement to the media against the protest and claimed the protest was staged by tax advocates to pressurise the AETC to do their unethical works, and defamatory slogans were made against Garg by the protestors. This statement by the association had angered tax professionals, who then called for a complete boycott of work inside the state taxation office in Ludhiana. Meanwhile, the decision to call of the strike was taken by professionals after a meeting of office-bearers of the District Taxation Bar Association (DTBA) (sales tax) with high-ranking officials of the state taxation department on Tuesday evening at the department\u2019s office in the mini secretariat. Efforts to contact the deputy excise and taxation commissioner (Ludhiana) Pawan Garg and AETC SK Garg proved futile. Meanwhile, speaking to TOI, DTBA secretary Chander Sehgal, former president Arun Kanwal, finance secretary Gaurav Sharma and others, said: \u201cWe have called off our strike today after an apology was tendered by the ETO Association for releasing a baseless statement to the media, in which false accusations were made against us. Today\u2019s meeting was also attended by additional excise and taxation commissioner Gurtej Singh, who has assured us that all pending works in all divisions will be completed soon, and tax-payers and tax professionals will not face any kind of problem. He has also given a time of one month to review the working of the AETC, and also assured us that the entire working in the department will be smooth.\u201d BOX 1 \u2018WE REGRET IT\u2019, SAYS ETO BODY The letter issued by ETO Association, which is signed by its general secretary Harjot Singh, says: \u201cIn a news published in various newspapers on 13.06.2019 in response to the strike by District Taxation Bar Association, it was mentioned that the said strike had been done to pressurise officers for getting their inappropriate works done. In this regard, it is clarified that the said wording was echoed by all the excise and taxation officers of the district Ludhiana-1 in the heat of the moment at that time, but there was no intention of alleging any bar member\u2019s integrity, and the officers, in fact, wanted to express that in such a tense environment, any mistake could happen while disposing of revenue-related work. Nevertheless, as the sentiments of the bar members have inadvertently been hurt, therefore all excise and taxation officers of Ludhiana-1 express the deepest regrets and withdraw the said words.\u201d BOX 2 DTBA TOO ISSUES STATEMENT Later in the evening, DTBA office-bearers acting president Saket Garg, former president Arun Kanwal, finance secretary Gaurav Sharma and others issued a statement to their members saying: \u201cAs you all are aware, there was a strike going on against the poor working and arrogant behaviour of AETC-1, and ETO Association Punjab came forward and stood with AETC-1 and put a false allegation that the motive of the strike was to put pressure on officers and advocates to do their illegal works. DTBA (Sales Tax), Ludhiana took a serious note of this allegation and issued a legal notice to them and filed a complaint against them in Bar Council of Punjab and Harayana. Today, Gurtez Singh, additional excise and taxation commissioner, Punjab DETC Pawan Garg, AETC SK Garg, and office-bearer of ETO Association met bar members of DTBA (Sales Tax), Ludhiana, felt sorry, and issued a press note to that effect, giving an assurance that within one month, AETC-1 will change his working style and sort out the problems of advocates.

The petition was filed in the Punjab and Haryana high court on April 30, by the former DSP\u2019s associate. According to legal experts, the state government was to challenge the court order issued in December last year, in which it had been directed to re-initiate the process of Jaspal\u2019s premature release from jail in the Khalra kidnapping and murder case. Jaspal had moved his premature release case in October 2017, but it was rejected by the Centre in June 2018, saying, \u201cIt is not a fit case for premature release.\u201d After the state government also turned down his case in August last year, Jaspal moved the high court in November and managed to get an order quashing state government\u2019s decision against his premature release. The court also directed the state government to initiate the process of his release after consultation (not consent) with the Union government. It said if the government failed to take a decision in this regard within four weeks, Jaspal should be released on temporary parole. In April this year, Jaspal filed his surety bonds and secured his temporary parole, but was detained in another case of custodial death by the Nabha jail superintendent. Following this, Jaspal\u2019s associate filed a habeas corpus in HC, saying he (Jaspal) was kept in illegal custody by the Nabha jailer. Jaspal\u2019s counsel contended before the court, that he (Jaspal) was convicted in the Khalra murder case and faced life imprisonment and was also convicted in another custodial death case in which he was awarded five years in jail. He said both the terms were to run concurrently and that Jaspal had completed the term for custodial death while being granted temporary parole by HC in the Khalra murder case. Nabha open jail superintendent Sucha Singh said the matter was in the notice of senior officials of the jails department. \u201cI have put all the facts before my seniors and they had taken note of the same,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, legal expert Sukhjinder Singh said since the case had been decided by the CBI court and later upheld by the Supreme Court, the decision to release Jaspal could not have been taken without the consent of the Union home department. He said even if the HC had granted him temporary parole and asked the government to re-initiate the case of his premature release, the state government could have filed a review petition in the court.

Residents rued that the bridge was being used by several people daily, and if it is dismantled, they would have to cross the area from another bridge, which remains crowded. However, with the intervention of mayor Balkar Sandhu, protestors were pacified, and civic officials moved away without carrying on the demolition. A team of civic officials had reached the area on Thursday morning for demolishing the bridge, but residents had started gathering at the place, and before civic officials could take any step, they started opposing the move. The residents and the councillor sat on the bridge and started raising slogans against the civic authorities. Sunita Rani said the bridge was mostly used by pedestrians, and generally women passed through the bridge, because there was an illegal fish market nearby, and it was difficult for women to use another bridge near Shivpuri. She said officials were turning a blind eye towards the illegal fish market, and one bridge in a dilapidated condition needed to be dismantled. She said they ended their protest only when the mayor first assured that inspection would be done at the spot, and only after that would any decision be taken.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Besides, the MC has been directed to deposit a fine equivalent to the amount it spends in one month on the operation and maintenance of the STPs. The action has been taken after PPCB took note of failed samples of treated water at the STPs which ultimately pollutes Buddha Nullah and Satluj river. The test of water samples at the STPs had revealed high levels of COD and BOD even after treatment of water at the plants. The sources said 46 treatment plants out of 84 STPs monitored in the state don\u2019t comply with norms and Ludhiana STPs are among these 46 STPs. After conducting hearing of MC officials, the PPCB chairman issued the directions the MC to deposit the bank guarantee and pay fine for spoiling the environment. Several complaints had been made regarding non-functional STPs of MC due to which untreated water is being discharged in the drain. The Satluj pollution had affected lives in Rajasthan too where people have fallen sick after consuming the water. Sandeep Behl, senior environment engineer, PPCB said, \u201cDespite repeated complaints and recommendations, MC did not act and upgraded its STPs. Now the situation is such that treated water does not fulfill the norms.\u201d He said they have sought this bank guarantee from the MC just to ensure that civic body will upgrade the STPs by March 2021 as per the deadline. Meanwhile, the PPCB has also refused to giving consent to these STPs, saying that these needed to be upgraded properly. Karunesh Garg, member secretary, PPCB, said, \u201cThe MC is not serious in fulfilling its role towards the city residents and that is why they have never understood the seriousness of the issue.\u201d He said as the matter is now with the National Green Tribunal and panel members are reviewing it regularly, it has to be seen whether the MC act now or not. The PPCB had also imposed Rs 50 lakh bank guarantee on MC for not fulfilling the solid waste management rules, but till now, the civic body has not paid the same. The civic officials have sought 10 days to deposit the bank guarantee to PPCB.

The wing had found that it was Harpreet Kaur\u2019s first venture into drug peddling. Her brother-in-law was identified as Ramesh Singh. In the second such case around the same time, the Ludhiana rural police had arrested another woman, Raju, from Mandiani village in Dakha after 45 illegal drug tablets were recovered from her. On June 9, the anti-narcotics wing had nabbed woman peddler Surinder Kaur of Gorsian Khan Muhammad along with a male peddler after 24 grams of heroin was recovered from them during a checking at Gorsian Kadar Baksh in Sidhwan Bet. These are not isolated cases in Ludhiana rural areas. The officials of the anti-narcotics wing said women peddlers have become a dangerous emerging trend. Wing in-charge inspector Navdeep Singh said they have arrested about seven women peddlers from various areas under Ludhiana rural jurisdiction in the past two months. He said about 20 of them were on their watchlist. Officials said half a kilogram of heroin was recovered from 15 women peddlers in the past six months. They added that these peddlers were mostly involved in selling heroin and only a few carried drug tablets and poppy husk. An officer of the anti-narcotics wing said most of the women were from families whose men were in the trade and were not able to go out or were in jail. The women were using their men\u2019s network and selling drugs to their customers. Wing officials said about 50% of such peddlers were educated women who knew about drugs and ventured into the trade for easy money. Some of them were addicts as well, they added.

Why heroin? Wing officials said because of the small size and large profit, heroin peddling was a natural choice for women. They use private parts to carry heroin and police have to work hard to meet the norms of the NDPS Act, as per which a woman constable checks the peddler in closed doors. They said women constables were well trained to check such carriers. Young blood A wing officer said about 80% of women peddlers were in the age group of 20 to 35 years.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users.

He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said.

Commissioner of police, while exercising his powers under Section 144 of CrPC 1973, has banned the sale of acid in all areas falling under the jurisdiction of police commissionerate, Ludhiana, for a period of two months. He said it had come to his notice that acid was being sold illegally in areas falling under the jurisdiction of Ludhiana police commissionerate. CP has ordered that no person can sell acid without a proper licence, which he would require to renew from time to time. He said the person selling acid should make sure he maintains complete records such as identity card, voter card, and complete address of the person buying it. He said acid cannot be sold to any person below 18 years of age. He also said the seller would maintain a proper record of stock in a register, and in case of any sale, he would submit the details with the area police station and SDM. As per orders in case of sale of acid to any hospital, industry, government department, or some other departments, etc, then the shopkeeper selling the acid would be himself responsible for collecting complete details of the head of the organization to which the acid was being sold. And the organization buying the acid should themselves ensure acid was stored in a safe place under the supervision of a responsible person. Besides, all details of stock and use of acid should be maintained in a separate register without fail. In another order, the police chief had also banned the operation of hookah bars in all areas under the jurisdiction of Ludhiana police commissionerate. He stated some hookah bars were operating illegally in the city, and they were causing serious harm to our residents, as the hookah contained tobacco and harmful chemicals. Keeping in mind the health of city residents, the commissioner of police had banned all hookah bars in the city. Further, he had imposed a ban on loudspeakers from 10pm to 6am in all areas falling under the jurisdiction of the Ludhiana police commissionerate. He said no person would be allowed to play loudspeakers at high volume from 10pm to 6am. He said when someone plays loudspeakers at high volume, it affects animals, birds, children, senior citizens, and patients. He said in case people want to organise a programme in this time period, then the organizers require permission from the authorities concerned. The commissioner of police has also banned the manufacture of those registration number plates of vehicles that flout the norms. He ordered that if any shopkeeper/painter manufactures an illegal number plate (which is against government rules), then strict action would be taken against them. He said sometimes, the registration number was not written in a proper and clear font, which becomes difficult for police to read. He has also banned the carrying of arms and ammunition in all marriage palaces falling under the jurisdiction of Ludhiana police commissionerate for a period of next two months. He said it had come to his notice that some people were openly carrying arms and ammunition at weddings/functions in marriage palaces, and sometimes in case of an altercation, or under the influence of drugs/liquor, these weapons were used. He said such instances endanger the lives of the common man. He said in case any person enters the marriage palace with arms and ammunition, then the marriage palace owner would himself be held responsible for immediately informing the police station concerned, adding that in case any person used his arms and ammunition in the marriage palace, then legal proceedings would be initiated against the person using the weapon, as well as the marriage palace owner.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination.

Put in category of \u2018dead\u2019 by the village multipurpose agricultural cooperative society, 13 small and marginal farmers of Badbar village in Barnala district have been struggling hard for the last six months to prove their existence and avail the benefit under Punjab government\u2019s debt relief scheme. Out of these 13 farmers, three held a protest outside the society office on Thursday, demanding justice. During these six months, these farmers have provided all the relevant documents, including Aadhaar cards, to prove themselves as alive but have still failed to convince the cooperative society to change their status from \u2018dead\u2019 to \u2018alive\u2019. Meanwhile, the officials claim that the farmers had initially failed to provide their Aadhaar cards and were to be put in the category of \u2018not available\u2019 but mistakenly got clubbed in the category of \u2018dead\u2019 by the cooperative society. Interestingly, this group of 13 includes Gurmukh Singh, who had prevailed upon a score of villagers to fill forms for getting compensation. Speaking to TOI, Gurmukh said, \u201cWhen the debt waiver process began in the village, I had filled forms of many farmers. Nearly six months ago, the cooperative society officials told me that my name had mistakenly been entered in the list of \u2018dead\u2019 and told to submit documents to prove that I was still alive. I deposited the relevant documents and was told that my name has been deleted from the list of \u2018dead\u2019. Now, about a week back, the cooperative society officials again called me, saying my name continues in the list of \u2018dead\u2019 and asked for documents again.\u201d \u201cI know that there are 12 others persons from my village who have also been shown as \u2018dead\u2019 and denied the debt waiver benefit. I have even approached the SDM in Barnala and requested him to instruct the cooperative department to set the record straight so that we (13) may also get the government assistance. But nothing has been done so far. I own 4 acres of land and am eligible for waiver of Rs 46,826,\u2019\u2019 he said. Another aggrieved farmer Jarnail Singh, who also owns 4 acre land and is eligible to get waiver of Rs 52,544, claimed, \u201cI provided all the documents to prove I was alive. Besides, everyone in the village cooperative society is well aware that I am not dead. I keep meeting them; yet remain in the category of \u2018dead\u2019. I am still struggling to get my status changed.\u201d Another marginal farmer Sukhwant Singh, who owns a oneacre landholding and is eligible for Rs 29,070 waiver, said, \u201cFor me, even this (Rs 29,070) amount means a lot as there is hardly any earning from the land and I am not in a position to repay the loan.\u201d Cooperative society secretary Jeet Singh said they had received a list from the assistant registrar\u2019s office nearly six months ago and it showed over 30 people as dead, when they were actually alive. \u201cAt a camp held at Kotduna village near here, I had informed the officials about the error and had provided the Aadhaar cards of these 30 people. I had even uploaded the Aadhaar cards on the official portal. After some time, the status of 17 beneficiaries changed, but 13 remained as \u2018dead\u2019 and they remain so despite me providing the Aadhaar cards again. Only a week ago, we got the list again \u2014 showing them as \u2018dead\u2019,\u201d he said. Barnala SDM Sandeep Kumar, when contacted, said, \u201cWe are trying to ascertain whose fault it is. An inquiry has been marked, to be conducted by the deputy registrar of cooperative societies, to find out how these living persons have been shown as dead and denied the benefits for which they are eligible.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The MLA Pandey has advised the mayor to pay attention towards other constituencies as well. The councillors were unhappy with the delay in completion of their development works and they counted large number of complaints against the officials. The sources revealed that MLA Pandey blamed the civic officials and delay in the works for lesser votes in the MP elections from his constituency. The councillors complained that despite passing of several months to allotment of development works in their wards, the work orders were not issued and contractors did not start the works. The councillors blamed the officials for delay in the process while officials held the contracts responsible for not starting the works. Mayor Balkar Sandhu has issued instructions to cancel the contract and blacklist those contractors who have not started the works till date. Some of the councillors also raised the demand for construction of static compactors in their areas on the pattern of West constituency so that garbage problem in the areas could come to end. However, the mayor gave the plea that static compactors policy has been decided at state government level, but the MLA as well as councillors opposed his statement. MC commissioner Brar however intervened and pacified everybody. The councillors and a few persons accompanying the MLA raised the matter that instead of blacklisting the contractors, MC should see why those contractors were not working. They claimed since MC was not making the payments, the contractors were least interested in completing the works. They asked the officials to recover the pending dues so that development works could take place in the city.

Police initiated an investigation under Section 174 of CrPC for further investigation. \u201cWe did not disclose the exact reason behind this happening, as we were waiting for medical reports that would help clear the air on the gateman\u2019s death, who was a retired armyman hailing from Gurdaspur district,\u201d said the police. On the other hand, railway officials claimed the gateman was murdered by some unknown miscreants when he was returning to the railway quarters late on Tuesday evening. Speaking on this issue, one railway official said: \u201cThere is no proper availability of a lighting system along with security cover on the railway crossing where the gateman performs his duty. Something went wrong in the case of Baldev Singh, as several injury marks were reported on his body when the police saw it. It might be a case that some animals may have attacked him when he was returning to his room after completing the day\u2019s work. The rail crossing where Baldev Singh was deputed was surrounded by agricultural land, where very few people visited throughout the day, so it becomes difficult to say it was not a murder case,\u201d said the railway official.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The accused have been identified as Rajni Devi, wife of Pradeep of Hathur, and Sonu Kumar of Bihla village. In his police complaint, Rajinder Rishidev of an area near Saim Nullah in Jagraon said he married his daughter Rajni to Pradeep about five years ago. The couple had a son named Sonu. The complainant said after a matrimonial dispute between the couple, his daughter left Pradeep and returned to his house with her son. Cops said Rajni fell in love with Sonu Kumar, an acquaintance of the family, and about five months ago she went with him, leaving her son with her parents. They said on Tuesday, Rajni had come to her parent\u2019s house. She and her paramour were sleeping in another shanty and her son Sonu was with his grandparents. Around 2am on Wednesday, both the accused took away the boy and strangulated him to death. The accused then threw his body near the slums and ran away. They added that Rajinder had seen the duo go with the child. Rajinder went in the direction. He lifted the child and found that he had died. He informed the cops, who moved the body to the civil hospital for post-mortem. Jagraon city SHO inspector Nidhan Singh said a case was registered in the morning and the accused were arrested within hours. Police said mother of the child had a bigger role in the murder as she wanted to get rid of him before having the baby of her lover. She hated her husband, a native of Bihar, and the child born of marriage with him, they added. \u201cRajni held the child\u2019s legs, while her paramour strangulated him,\u201d said a cop.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

However, members of Finance and Contracts committee (F&CC) will take final decision in this regard on Thursday. The Sarabha Nagar market is the most sought after market of the city. Youngsters and people frequenting the market almost on a daily basis have been complaining about hiked parking rates there. On an average, around 1,500 cars are parked in the parking lot on a daily basis. A team of MC officials checked the parking site on April 22, where it was found that employees were not wearing the uniform or even reflector jackets as supposed to. Neither were they able to produce their identity cards, nor where they carrying e-ticket machines. At the entrance and exit points of the parking lot, CCTVs were not installed. Despite the contractor being given a notice on May 13 and being asked to give a clarification, the civic officials did not receive any reply. The civic body thus decided to propose cancellation of the agreement. MC commissioner Brar said, \u201cA proposal has been prepared for the cancellation of the agreement and the final decision will be taken in the meeting on Thursday.\u201d She said the MC is planning to run these parking sites at their level in future, and a system is being prepared in this regard. The civic body had conducted auction of 11 parking sites in August, 2018, and firm Jugnu Engineer and Fabrication, Ludhiana, was given the contract for handling this parking site from August 26, 2018, till August 25, 2019. The contractor had deposited the Rs 6.43 lakh security deposit as well. Jugnu Engineer and Fabrication Ludhiana was also allotted the parking lots in Model Town extension, BRS Nagar, and Gill Road, but he had left the contract while saying that these locations were not profitable. In the meeting on Wednesday, a proposal will be mooted to blacklist the contractor and his security deposit would be forfeited as he violated the contracts before its maturity. Meanwhile, the parking site contractor Munish Shah said, \u201cThe officials are only doing this to harass the contractors. The agreement is anyway about to get over in two months.\u201d He said he has already paid all dues to the corporation and on commenting on the allegations of violating the contracts of three parking sites, he said he had left the three sites only after completing the legal formalities and MC thus cannot take any action against him.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state.

He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.
