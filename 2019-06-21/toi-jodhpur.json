A report by Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI) reveals that the spurt in economic activities in the desert districts has shattered the fragile landscape, impacting its residents directly. CAZRI shared the report to mark the World Day to Combat Desertification on June 17. This was compiled using multiple independent studies including the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite data 2015-16. The report made the astonishing claim that 14.88-million-hectare land in 12 western Rajasthan districts suffered from different kinds of land degradation contributing to desertification. The report has studied the features of desertification: wind erosion / deposition, water erosion, salinity/ alkalinity, waterlogging and vegetation degradation to conclude that the situation may take decades to reverse the damage. The report studied districts of Barmer, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Churu, Ganganagar, Hanumangarh, Jodhpur, Jalore, Jhunjhunu, Nagaur, Pali and Sikar. \u201cThe biggest reason contributing to desertification turned out to be water erosion. Our report suggested that 64.69% mapped area is facing wind erosion. For instance, 10% of land degradation in districts like Barmer, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur is due to water erosion,\u201d said O P Yadav, director, CAZRI. Explaining the reason why the sandy landscape existing from millions of years is facing the change only in the last few decades, the report explained that such landscapes are highly vulnerable to wind erosion and it is a universal phenomenon. \u201cWhat made the situation worse is human-induced activities like fast urbanization, deforestation, mining, indiscriminate use of groundwater, rise in livestock population and the hot summers leading to evaporation. This has accelerated desertification,\u201d said Yadav. Supporting their claim, the scientist says that western Rajasthan harbours a total domestic livestock population of nearly 30.18 million heads \u2013 an increase of 14.63 million heads (94.72%) over the 1956 Census figures. \u201cThe destruction of vegetative cover due to overgrazing, felling of trees, etc. have accelerated the removal of sediments from the catchment areas of waterbodies as well as loosening of farm soil,\u201d said Yadav. Large-scale mining has been mapped in Jhunjhunu, Jalore, Jodhpur, Barmer for the minerals and building materials, which has impacted the equilibrium. The vegetation cover has gone forever, making the land vulnerable. The report added that the overall scenario has affected the agricultural productivity to a great extent. The introduction of water intensive and multiple crops have their adverse effects in the region. \u201cThe empirical data is still being collected to give exact mass land converted into desert,\u201d said Yadav. The team of scientists are also accessing the damage being caused due to increasing vehicular traffic, construction of roads and canal and exploration of oil and gas.

In its recent order pertaining to the industrial pollution of Jojari river, which has fallen an abject victim of untreated industrial discharge and sludge disposal, the bench of NGT headed by Justice S Raghvendra Rathore gave these directions to the DGP who had been summoned by the tribunal. The task force, which will have an ASP, four sub-inspectors, three head constables and 21 constables, will work in three shifts from its fully dedicated separate office close to the industrial area. \u201cThe task force will submit its report to the ADG on daily basis and the ADG will submit a comprehensive report to the NGT on monthly basis,\u201d the order said. The order has come after the incessant non-compliance of the tribunal\u2019s directions to the industrialists to treat the industrial effluent at the CETP before discharging it into open and failure of the pollution control board and other agencies to monitor these units and ensure compliance of the directions of the tribunal. The task force will have the responsibility to take action against any unit discharging its effluent and sludge into open or in any natural source of water like Jojari river. The task force will have power to seal such units and such sealed units will not be able to resume work only after the permission of the NGT. The task force will also check the unit for absence of any permit or formality. Even the vehicle, used by the unit in transporting the sludge to be disposed of in any open area, will be seized by the task force and would be subject to the permission of the NGT for release.

Her body was extracted from the borewell on Tuesday morning, after 14 hours of her falling into the borewell, and handed over to the family members. \u201cDespite all efforts, we could not take the girl out of the borewell. Her body was taken out on Tuesday around 7.30am,\u201d said an administrative official. He said that a compensation of Rs one lakh from the chief minister relief fund has been given to the parents of the girl. Seema had fallen into a 400-feet deep borewell on Monday at about 5.30pm and had gotten stuck at the depth of 260 feet. Initially, the sound of her crying could be easily heard but the sound gradually kept dying and completely stopped at around midnight. \u201cIn order to keep her alive and meet the shortage of oxygen down there, we made arrangements to pump in the oxygen from an ambulance, parallel with the rescue operation,\u201d said the officer. Two earth moving machines had also been roped in to dig around the borewell but the rocky formations at the depth of 40 feet hampered the operation, after which the digging had to stop. After the rescue teams and officials came to the conclusion that the girl was no more, a rope with a tool which could stick in her clothes or body parts, was dropped in the borewell. After some efforts, her body was taken out. It may be noted that the tube well at the farm had broken down on Monday afternoon and the owner of the farm had taken the pump out for repairing, thereby leaving the borewell open, which finally turned out to be disastrous for his own daughter, who was playing around the farm and fell into it.

Rajasthan Engineering Admission Process(REAP) are upbeat over the responses in the ongoing admission process. Last year, for around 40,000 seats, less than 15,000 applications were received. Till June 7, the body has received 7000 applications against the figure of 2000 last year in the first seven days of the admission process. As per experts, one of the reasons for less number of applicants last year was lower awareness among students regarding the examination and its benefits. This year, officials said that they have been promoting the examination by advertising on radio, television, newspapers and even sent officials to promote it within government school students. Sandeep Kumar, convener of the REAP, 2019 examination, said, \u201cLast date of filling the form is June 29. Till June 7, we have already received 7,000 applications and the number is increasing every day. This is really a positive sign as last year by this date only 2,000 forms were received.\u201d Due to the low turnout of students, government has been attempting various methods to attract more students. In 2017, one of the reasons for less number of applicants was the condition to deposit of advance amount of Rs 10,000 (refundable) along with the form fees of Rs 700. However, this was changed in 2018 and students were able to directly apply by depositing form fees. Earlier, exam was conducted for selection but now candidates are selected on the basis of JEE Mains and Advance rank An institute round is also conducted for any remaining seats where students can directly apply to the college of their choice. An official on condition of anonymity said that less number of students are opting for engineering because of low rate of placements in the field. \u201cIn Rajasthan, students opt for civil, electrical and mechanical engineering due to the scope available in government jobs. In other branches of engineering, placements are not as good as most companies prefer to hire engineers from Bangalore and there is no mechanism to hire graduates from Rajasthan colleges,\u201d said the official. For mechanical engineering, equipment is costlier than other streams, hence, investment in infrastructure is poor. Punneet Sharma, an academician said that this year the trend is shifting and serious students are opting for Computer Science and Information technology due to the new developments in Artificial Intelligence.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly.

Meena\u2019s remark comes in the wake of Gehlot\u2019s recent statement that Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Sachin Pilot should take responsibility for his son Vaibhav Gehlot\u2019s defeat from Jodhpur. \u201cA CM is responsible for an election defeat when the party is in power.

My personal opinion: MLA \u201cAfter the assembly elections, I had said Sachin Pilot should become the chief minister. I have nothing to do with Pilot, but I said this because it was because of him that we got the majority. Out of the 46 seats in east Rajasthan, we won 43 seats. Ashok Gehlot doesn\u2019t have influence on people anymore. There is no public liking for him. The Jats, Meenas, Gurjars are angry (with Gehlot), then who will give votes,\u201d he asked. The MLA, however, said that it was his personal opinion that Pilot should be made the chief minister. \u201cHe (Gehlot) was the chief minister twice before. But after that, we got 56 and 21 seats (after assembly elections in 2003 and 2013). Only the person who can win votes and work for the the development of the state should be made the chief minister. He (Gehlot) has been the CM twice, now a new person should be made the chief minister. This is my personal view,\u201d said Meena.

Sending out a signal that attacks on the state leadership will be treated as indiscipline, the party has sought an explanation from Todabhim legislator P R Meena who had said that deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot should replace Ashok Gehlot as the chief minister following the party\u2019s failure in Lok Sabha polls. AICC general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan, Avinash Pande said that partymen making irresponsible statements were furthering BJP\u2019s negative agenda against Congress. \u201cWe only are furthering their (BJP) agenda of harming the Congress. In the party\u2019s interest, it is our collective responsibility that we do not dent the party\u2019s image; like disciplined soldiers we need to exhibit our unity under the adverse circumstances (rout in Lok Sabha polls),\u201d Pande said in a statement released on Thursday. A day earlier, Congress legislator Meena had openly held chief minister Gehlot responsible for the party\u2019s loss in Lok Sabha elections. For the second consecutive parliamentary elections, Congress drew a blank in Rajasthan, which has 25 Lok Sabha seats. \u201cThere is no public liking for Gehlot anymore. The Jats, Meenas, Gujjars and others are angry with him; then who will vote for us?\u201d Meena had asked, while talking to reporters on Wednesday. Pande on Thursday asserted that Congress was still the country\u2019s primary political party, though it is presently in power in just few states. \u201cIt is the responsibility of all Congressmen to maintain discipline and make no public statement directly or indirectly before the media or on social media that may imply that someone is trying to harm the party for personal benefit or is working on a personal agenda,\u201d Pande said. Before MLA Meena, food and civil supplies minister Ramesh Meena had attacked Gehlot-government saying that the common man\u2019s grievances were not being addressed as the bureaucracy was ruling the state. In fact, after a PCC executive committee meeting last week that approved the resolution asking Rahul Gandhi not to step down as Congress president, deputy CM Sachin Pilot had told media, \u201cWe would study and analyze why within 4-5 months after forming Congress government in the state, the people have chosen BJP (in Lok Sabha elections).\u201d Early this week, Gehlot targeted Pilot\u2014while talking to a Hindi news channel\u2014by asking him to own responsibility for the party\u2019s loss in Jodhpur Lok Sabha seat at least. After a series of controversial statements by Congressmen brought out infighting at top level in Rajasthan, state\u2019s Congress in-charge Pande has urged party men not to get diverted by the \u201cdifficult circumstances\u201d arising from the \u201cpresent scenario\u201d (Congress being reduced to low numbers in Lok Sabha).

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

A single bench of Justice P S Bhati rejected some petitions pertaining to a RHB housing project in Bikaner\u2019s Mukta Prasad Nagar in which the buyers challenged an additional demand of Rs 20 lakh over the actual roll out price at the time of giving physical possession of housing units, but directed the board to exercise caution in future. The petitioners argued that this demand was irrespective of the assurance by the board during launch of the scheme that there would not be any variation in the price more than 10% of the original price. The board, however, justifying the additional demand of Rs 20 lakh, attributed it to the expenditure incurred on sewerage network, water supply, road network and street lights like basic amenities.

The wildlife department is also taking the help of scientists from Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to find a pesticide which just targets the locusts and doesn\u2019t harm any other animal or bird. The letter (a copy of which is with TOI) states that pesticides being sprayed in Jaisalmer district to kill locusts has become a threat to the GIB particularly in Ramdeora, Lokarki and nearby areas since the state bird regularly feeds on this insect thus there is a threat to health of GIBs which consume them. The letter further urges the that not only the use of harmful pesticides should be avoided but suitable taxa specific bio pesticides maybe utilised for overcoming the locust\u2019s problem without affecting the GIB. Talking to TOI, Arindam Tomar, chief wildlife warden, Rajasthan said, \u201cThe locusts cannot be allowed to multiply but at the same time it has to be ensured that GIBs are not affected because of the pesticides being used. We have sensitised the concerned authorities on the same.\u201d GIB is listed as Schedule I species of Wildlife Protection Act 1972 and is defined as \u2018critically endangered by the IUCN Red Data List with just over a 100 left. Keeping this in mind, the locusts issue becomes extremely serious, claim officials and environmentalists. Meanwhile the wildlife department has also been taking measures to curb the threat to the GIB. \u201cA team from WII has reached Jaisalmer and few more would be arriving as well to find a solution to the problem. We are trying to find a pesticide which will only kill the locusts but not harm any other species. Controlling the locusts is also important but so is saving the GIB\u201d, added Tomar. The field workers from the wildlife department have also been deployed to ensure that no GIB ventures into the areas where the pesticides are being sprayed to kill locusts.

A total of 1,509 rape cases have been registered in past four months in Rajasthan this year, recording a significant high, compared to 1,312 cases in 2018 in the same period. The Alwar gang-rape case may have stirred the conscience of the state, but the figures indicate that successive governments have little to show up for women\u2019s security, as rape cases have been steadily rising. The 15 per cent spike in the figures falls flat on the much-touted efforts by the government to curb crimes against women. There is also a very high pending percentage in rape cases reported this year. For instance, of the 1,509 cases registered this year, 858 cases are pending, while FR (Final Report) was submitted in 302 cases and chargesheets were filed in 349 cases. A senior police official attributed the steep rise in figures to high registration of the cases at the police stations. \u201cFor past four months, all police stations were told that no complainant should be turned down and an FIR must be registered without dilly-dallying. The increase in figure also shows that cases are being registered by the police,\u201d official said, adding that decoy operations conducted by the PHQ led to the increase in cases. The police\u2019 claims about cases being easily registered at police stations are contradicted by a series of events that followed soon after a young Dalit girl in Alwar was gang-raped by four men in front of her husband on April 26. Despite her constant pleadings, the police dragged its feet in filing the case, compelling her to go through worst ordeal which allowed the accused to make extortion calls to her. The gang-rape case offers a study of difficulties faced by rape-survivors in registering FIRs. \u201cThe government and the police have said multiple times that FIRs should be registered without delay, even if it means increase in numbers,\u201d claimed the official, adding that a new deputy SP (DSP) rank official will be posted in each district for women\u2019s security.

His father, a daily wager from Jodhpur, ran from pillar to post to get back the vision of his son but gave up soon, after spending his savings. \u201cI went from government hospitals of Jodhpur to Ahmedabad, but nowhere did I receive any firm reply. I thought of visiting private hospitals but considering the cost of treatment there, I dropped the idea and left everything to god,\u201d said his father Lalit Chawda.

The excessive loss of water due to evaporation is leading to mass migration of people, livestock and desertification of the cropped land. To mark the world environemnt day, a Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI), Jodhpur shared its detailed report on the impact of rising temperature in the arid region says that one degree rise in temperature would increase the evapotranspiration by 35 mm to 96 mm. It translates into the additional water requirement of 1.57 lakh MLD water per annum to feed the irrigated land. The report studied the temperature, rainfall, surface heating, evapotranspiration and its sociological impact in districts including Barmer, Bikaner, Churu, Ganganagar, Hanumangarh, Jaisalmer, Jalore, Jhunjhunu, Jodhpur, Nagaur, Pali and Sikar. Highlighting the alacrity of the situation, Rajesh Goyal, principal scientist at CAZRI told TOI, \u201cThe total available groundwater for irrigation in the desert region is 3,516.9 MCM and increase of 1% in temperature will put additional stress of 44% on existing groundwater resources based on present land use pattern. The additional water requirement will put more groundwater zones into a dark category.\u201d Rajasthan at present has 595 groundwater zones of which 268 zones are under the categories of grey and dark zones where the water has been utilised more than 65%. The drought every alternate year takes 10-15 years for any zone to hold water more than 50%. Globally evapotranspiration trends are projected for 5% to 10% increase with the increase in temperature by 2 to 5 degree Celsius. The rise in temperature has already started costing the farmers of these districts. The report says that with the rise of one degree temperature in Ganganagar would require about 276.19 MCM water and Hanumangarh would need 245.33 MCM water. \u201cThe additional water means, additional power and other resources making the sustainable living difficult. Ultimately, farmers are left with no option to opt of the farming due to the rising cost,\u201d said Goyal. This factor further contributes to the migration of people. The sociologist had already pointed out that the first phase of migration which is men leaving their traditional means of livelihood for a living has started. \u201cIn no time, the men would be leaving their soil with their families and livestock which will eventually push them into poverty,\u201d said Dr Zahida Shabnam, a historian on Rajasthani culture and tribes.

The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The spice board had set up seven parks in the country including two in Rajasthan, one each at Jodhpur and Kota. Out of the 28 plots spread over 60 acre in the Jodhpur park, 25 had been allotted, but only four units have come up. In Kota, where the park occupies 30 acre land with 17 industrial plots, not a single unit has been set up even though 11 plots were allotted to entrepreneurs. In a meeting on Monday, industries commissioner K K Pathak sought views of the department over taking over the assets and management. Speaking to TOI, Pathak said that the state government will require clarity as to the status the land allotment, common facilities and other aspects of the parks. \u201cRajasthan is rich in spice production but farmers can only benefit if the processing plants are set up within the mandated timeframe which has not happened.

The source said there is no clarity as to land lease agreements for plots in Kota. \u201cAlso, we need to have a full picture of the contract signed between the spice board and the private party for putting up common facilities like drains, roads and other infrastructure,\u201d he said.

A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital.

On the other hand, deputy commissioner (City) has also directed the zone encroachment in-charge of city and Sardarpura to list out the buildings with no fire safety mechanism in place. It may be noted that any building in the city with more than two floors, requires a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the fire safety department of the JMC.

Om Prakash, a constable and Shyam Singh, a teacher, have long been claiming the ownership of a cow and had even lodged a police complaint in August 2018 in Mandore police station. The police officers, to begin with, tried to solve the ownership issue on their own level using different methods and tactics, but in vain. Finally, when the matter reached the court, the magistrate summoned the cow into the court about two months back, but even he could not arrive at any conclusion. Lastly, it was decided to leave it upto the cow herself to decide her ownership and she was left at a little distance from the houses of both the claimants under the monitoring of the court. The cow, from here, walked to the house of Om Prakash, though, she did not enter the house but the court considered it to be a gesture enough to decide the ownership and close the matter. The magistrate had also tried to settle the matter between both the claimants amicably but Shyam Singh refused, stating that he had a strong devotion for the cow and he could not give it to anybody. Om Prakash, however, was happy with this decision, but Shyam Singh said that he was not satisfied with the decision and would challenge this decision in upper court. It may be noted that initially, the petition had been rejected by the metropolitan court, after which an appeal was filed in the sessions court, which directed the metropolitan court to re-examine the matter and report to the sessions court.

In a letter to the divisional commissioner and other officials, Gyan Prakash Soni has cited the ill-effects of excessive number of lights installed to beautify the lake.\u201cAuthentic studies reveal that light pollution around lakes prevents zooplankton, such as Daphnia, from eating surface algae causing algal blooms. Bright outdoor lights disrupt the migrating, eating and mating of nocturnal animals. Unwanted light trespassing into surrounding natural areas not only disturbs but can also attract nearby wildlife. Trees are induced to shed their leaves out of cycle, disrupting the basis of the food chain, claimed Soni in a letter sent to the authorities. He further said that birds that take shelter on nearby trees feel navigational problems and their sleep quality is disturbed due to artificial lighting. Light pollution destroys nitrate radicals thus preventing the normal night time reduction pf atmospheric smog produced by fumes emitted from cars and factories. Experts opine the sky glow impact of LED lights is between 4 \u2013 8 whereas it is between 1 to 2.4 for sodium lamps. The suggestion to improve the situation has been given as lowering the pole height, changing the angle of light fixtures, providing shielding, etc. Soni also said that the well-developed rows of green trees along Fateh Sagar Paal have been damaged heavily during past three-four years. Branches of trees are being cut partially by axing in such a way that they will fall after a few days. Then, the fallen branches are lifted as if they have fallen naturally. The dismal situation of tree cutting or drying or heavy pruning along Fateh Sagar Paal would prove a threat to environment and to overall safety of the earthen Paal because the drying roots of such trees will certainly create hollowness in the embankment. This type of activity is also snatching the shelter of many birds.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party.

They also submitted a memorandum to the administration and forest officials, drawing their attention to this grim situation leading to premature deaths of the wildlife. Absence of water has also forced the wildlife to displace to other locations in search of water and many of them die in this search as the situation is the same everywhere around, with hardly any water left in rural water bodies. The situation is worse in the border districts of Barmer and Jaisalmer, where the villagers are compelled to leave their livestock to fend for themselves, as they neither have fodder nor water to keep them alive.

The Congress leader hit out at BJP's strategy of playing the nationalist card. \"We are Congress\u2026 we launched the freedom movement\u2026 gave our blood and sweat\u2026 braved British atrocities \u2026 we don't need any certificate to prove our nationalist feelings especially from the ones who apologised to the British at that time\", asserted Priyanka, urging the workers to go to every household in their area and meet every voter. She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022. And once we come, we will stay here for long on the basis of our hard work,\" she said adding that the hard-workers would be adequately rewarded.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

The debacle in the Lok Sabha polls on May 23 has kicked up a storm in the party as its ministers, MLAs and leaders are taking on their own government, bureaucracy, cops and administration. They are hitting more headlines for opposing the government. Congress MLA and ex-DGP Harish Meena was staging sit-in against the Tonk police alleging murder when a tractor driver died. Meena found support in BJP leader, Rajya Sabha MP Kirori Lal Meena who shared the protest site with the former on Monday. This left the senior party leaders red-faced. Meena's own party leaders are denouncing his wisdom by calling it as an accident. However, later Meena called off his protest as the government agreed to his demands. Another front has been opened by cabinet minister Vishvendra Singh who is taking on police and administration for crimes in his constituency of Bharatpur. The minister alleged police of extorting money from traders and the locals. In a series of tweets from the past five days, he has been accusing the police of the same. Government took some corrective measures which failed to impress the minister. Singh has found support from BJP on his timeline causing embarrassment for party workers. TOI called Singh but he remained unavailable. Sources said that his ministerial colleagues have asked him to stop venting his anger in public but the minister refused to listen. In both the cases, the matter has not rung the bell at senior level where the party leaders did not show any urgency to resolve the issue. The party had also not been able to handle minister Lalchand Kataria\u2019s resignation letter. The minister submitted his resignation on May 25 and was untraceable for the next four days. His letter reads that resignation has been sent to the CM and the governor. However, the government refused to admit about his resignation. In fact, it was not even aware of the minister\u2019s whereabouts who surfaced at the CM\u2019s residence on May 31. MLA from Dausa, Ramesh Meena had also hit the headlines after he publicly attacked the bureaucracy for not letting him carry out development works. Similarly, MLA from Nimbahera, Udailal Anjana questioned the party\u2019s decision to field Vaibhav Gehlot from Jodhpur and failure to form an alliance with Hanuman Beniwal\u2019s RLP. Both later assured that they are not against the party and aired their views in their personal capacity.

He had allegedly been caught with a gun by the locals belonging to the Bishnoi Tiger Force on Monday midnight, while he was allegedly looking for an animal to hunt there. A video of the conflict between the policeman and the activists attempting to snatch his gun, has gone viral on social media. The constable, identified as Satyapal Singh, had been allegedly found in search of some animals for hunting, with an aide amidst the farms of the village with a double barrel gun. The villagers snatched the gun from him and informed the police and forest department. The gun was handed over to the police but the said accused managed to flee taking advantage of the night. The activists alleged that the policeman later attacked one of their men early on Tuesday morning injuring him and damaging his motorcycle. According to the Luni police, a case has been registered against Satyapal Singh under appropriate sections of IPC, which are 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by weapon) and 341 (wrongful restraint). A counter case has also been registered against the activists on the complaint of the aide of the policeman, alleging causing them hurt and caste-based comments. In the morning, the activists of the Bishnoi Tiger Force (BTF) along with the villagers and wildlife lovers staged a demonstration at the Luni police station, exerting pressure on the police to take action in the matter and file a case against the accused policeman.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal.
