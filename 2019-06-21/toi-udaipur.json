Rajasthan Engineering Admission Process(REAP) are upbeat over the responses in the ongoing admission process. Last year, for around 40,000 seats, less than 15,000 applications were received. Till June 7, the body has received 7000 applications against the figure of 2000 last year in the first seven days of the admission process. As per experts, one of the reasons for less number of applicants last year was lower awareness among students regarding the examination and its benefits. This year, officials said that they have been promoting the examination by advertising on radio, television, newspapers and even sent officials to promote it within government school students. Sandeep Kumar, convener of the REAP, 2019 examination, said, \u201cLast date of filling the form is June 29. Till June 7, we have already received 7,000 applications and the number is increasing every day. This is really a positive sign as last year by this date only 2,000 forms were received.\u201d Due to the low turnout of students, government has been attempting various methods to attract more students. In 2017, one of the reasons for less number of applicants was the condition to deposit of advance amount of Rs 10,000 (refundable) along with the form fees of Rs 700. However, this was changed in 2018 and students were able to directly apply by depositing form fees. Earlier, exam was conducted for selection but now candidates are selected on the basis of JEE Mains and Advance rank An institute round is also conducted for any remaining seats where students can directly apply to the college of their choice. An official on condition of anonymity said that less number of students are opting for engineering because of low rate of placements in the field. \u201cIn Rajasthan, students opt for civil, electrical and mechanical engineering due to the scope available in government jobs. In other branches of engineering, placements are not as good as most companies prefer to hire engineers from Bangalore and there is no mechanism to hire graduates from Rajasthan colleges,\u201d said the official. For mechanical engineering, equipment is costlier than other streams, hence, investment in infrastructure is poor.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

According to sources, the bride Vinita was in love with accused Priyank who hailed from a different caste. Her family stood against their union and hence had fixed her marriage with Kshitij. Police found a letter written by Vinita who confessed her intense love for Priyank and said that she was going away with him as they could not live without each other. In the letter, the bride wrote that she was in touch with Priyank whom she had known for 13 years. He tried to convince her parents but in vain as her family didn't accept their love and gave more value to societal values and honour. \u201cHad you realized our love you would not have forced me to marry Kshitij but I cannot live without Priyank and hence do not search for us,\u201d the letter read. The bride also urged her parents not to create any trouble for Priyank\u2019s family. Earlier, on Tuesday morning when a bride who was on her way to in-laws home after vidai ceremony, was forcedly taken away by some men in a car. The assailants damaged the bride's car, thrashed the groom severely before fleeing with the bride. Special police teams comprising of all SHOs of city police stations is on lookout for the abductors and the bride while community people from the girls side held massive protest at the crime scene and police station demanding an immediate arrest of the accused. The bride's family has expressed suspicion on a youth from the neighborhood to be behind the kidnap. Police had a hard time pacifying community men from the accused's side who stood in the way of the police while taking the accused's family to police station for interrogation. \"Special teams have been made to find the accused and bride. CCTV footage have been sought and alerts have been raised at toll plazas. Some people have been interrogated and we will find the kidnappers soon\" additional SP, city Gopal Swaroop Mewara said. Police didn't rule out a love angle in the case as that had been in the Sikar incident. The groom Kshitij Sharma, a resident of Chintaman Ghati of Bhattiyani Chohhatta area had tied the nuptial with the bride, a resident of Titardi under Savina police station limit. The rituals were performed on Monday late night and hence vidai was held early morning. Around 6 am the bride has set off with her husband in his car while other relatives were following in other cars. Near a railway crossing, a white car stopped before their car and few men barged out and laid an attack. They damaged the glass and thrashed the groom. They fled with the bride. People from the bride and groom's side gathered at the news spread and police had to face severe anger. The bride's family named a youth from their neighbourhood to be involved in the kidnapping who was from another caste. Police went to search the house of the accused where they couldn't find him and hence as they were ready to take his family to police station, their community people protested sharply.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "At 33.1\u00b0C, Jaipur logs warmest morning": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/at-33-1c-jaipur-logs-warmest-morning/articleshow/69607370.cms", "time": "2019-06-01 09:05:00", "description": "JAIPUR: The state remained under the grip of severe heatwave conditions for the fourth consecutive day on Friday with majority of places witnessing maximum temperatures of above 44 degree Celsius.

The Central ministry has given approval for the project. The actual cost of the project will be ascertained after the detailed project report (DPR). As per the initial project report, Rs 350 crore will be spent on the entire project,\u201d said an official. The project is expected to solve the perennial traffic problem at Bhankrota and Mahapura junction which have become a part of the city after expansion. The absence of a flyover on these points leaves the traffic in knots. The faulty planning of NHAI on NH-8 (Jaipur-Ajmer) is allegedly giving sleepless nights to the traffic department. In a traffic control board (TCB) meetings, the traffic department has strongly urged the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) to construct a flyover at Mahapura and Bhankrota crossroads several times. \u201cAt Kamla Nehru Nagar, the flyover was constructed at one end. As per the requirement, the structure will be built at both ends to provide swift passage,\u201d added the official. An official source at Jaipur police said, \u201cThe JDA had assured to draw a plan to reduce traffic congestion in the area. However, the plight of drivers and motorists passing through the choked stretches of NH-8 did not come to an end as the civic body expressed helplessness in constructing flyover over these stretches because the area comes under NHAI jurisdiction.\u201d The Jaipur-Ajmer highway is the main national highway which connects Udaipur, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad. Thus, the traffic load is too high on the highway. After the city expanded during the last few years, many colonies sprung up on NH-8 resulting in heavy traffic. Commuters have expressed the necessity of a flyover in the area as the stretch is choked due to heavy vehicles including trucks. Moreover, frequent accidents near Mahapura have raised concerns of the traffic department. \u201cThe JDA periphery ends at C-zone bypass.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

A complaint against 19 persons, including many of her relatives, was registered at Kheroda police station of the district on Friday night. \u201cWe have received the complaint and a case has been registered. An investigation is underway and proper action would be taken after detailed interrogation of all the people involved in the act,\u201d Lakhan Singh Meena, Dy SP Vallabhnagar circle told the media. The rape survivor, resident of Bhopal Kheda village under Kheroda police station area, in her plaint said she was misled and persuaded by her paternal uncle and his wife to elope with a youth, whom her parents had agreed to give her in marriage. She said she didn't know it was a conspiracy to take her away to a distant place, where some of the accused made her forcibly marry Jamnalal, her fianc\u00e9. The woman said she was kept in a secret place in Nasik for some time, until she was 18 years old. Later, Jamnalal began pressurising her to dance in beer bars and sleep with clients to earn money. When she opposed him, she was tortured and sexually abused by many men, who were invited by her husband. \u201cThey forced me to dance, have sex with them and on refusing to surrender, they gang-raped me not once but many times.

The survivor told the police that her husband and his relatives took her in a van and threw her outside the Kheroda police station. Her father claimed that many of his and his wife's relatives including his brother, sister-in-law, her husband, were involved in misleading the minor girl to run away from home and are thus responsible for her exploitation.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

In a letter to the divisional commissioner and other officials, Gyan Prakash Soni has cited the ill-effects of excessive number of lights installed to beautify the lake.\u201cAuthentic studies reveal that light pollution around lakes prevents zooplankton, such as Daphnia, from eating surface algae causing algal blooms. Bright outdoor lights disrupt the migrating, eating and mating of nocturnal animals. Unwanted light trespassing into surrounding natural areas not only disturbs but can also attract nearby wildlife. Trees are induced to shed their leaves out of cycle, disrupting the basis of the food chain, claimed Soni in a letter sent to the authorities. He further said that birds that take shelter on nearby trees feel navigational problems and their sleep quality is disturbed due to artificial lighting. Light pollution destroys nitrate radicals thus preventing the normal night time reduction pf atmospheric smog produced by fumes emitted from cars and factories. Experts opine the sky glow impact of LED lights is between 4 \u2013 8 whereas it is between 1 to 2.4 for sodium lamps. The suggestion to improve the situation has been given as lowering the pole height, changing the angle of light fixtures, providing shielding, etc. Soni also said that the well-developed rows of green trees along Fateh Sagar Paal have been damaged heavily during past three-four years. Branches of trees are being cut partially by axing in such a way that they will fall after a few days. Then, the fallen branches are lifted as if they have fallen naturally. The dismal situation of tree cutting or drying or heavy pruning along Fateh Sagar Paal would prove a threat to environment and to overall safety of the earthen Paal because the drying roots of such trees will certainly create hollowness in the embankment. This type of activity is also snatching the shelter of many birds.

The city of lakes presents a grim picture with hundreds of buildings flouting fire safety norms. Non-installation of fire equipment, congested staircases, narrow entry roads and absence of trained personnel to tackle emergencies are major causes of concern. Areas like many multi-storeyed buildings in busy markets and commercial centres like Durga Nursery Road regarded as the hub of coaching institutes in the city. As per sources, some time back the Udaipur Municipal Corporation had identified 282 buildings that were found to be violating fire safety norms. Notices were issued to them, however, the compliance part was taken casually. Of these, 186 buildings fell under the Urban Improvement Trust area and hence those files were sent to UIT for action. On Saturday, the officials of the fire-fighting department held surprise checks of around 30 coaching centres and shockingly most of them lacked equipment for fire safety. Most of the coaching rooms were situated in the basement, ground and first-floor of the buildings which had single entry and exit points. Few centres had fire extinguishers, but the machines did not have gas and none of them had trained personnel to handle fire emergencies. Fire officer Jalaj Ghasiya and his team held mock drills and demonstrations in a few coaching centres, hotels and malls. The fire fighters held mock fires at some places and taught people how to control the flames. The fire officer also instructed the heads of coaching centres to make arrangements to comply with the fire safety rules within a week. If they do not adhere to the warning, prosecution action would be taken, the officer said.

The discount will be offered on 196 houses, which are sized approximately 30 square metre. An RHB official source said, \u201cIt was shocking to receive a proposal to sell flats on 75% discounted rates. We have to look for provision whether so much discount could be given or not. But, the Kota division officials have informed, in the past, houses in this area were constructed without planning and no one would purchase them if a discount is not offered.\u201d After failing to sell off its constructed houses, the RHB had initiated an exercise to sell its unsold flats and houses on discounted rates. At present, the board has more than 24,000 unsold flats in its circles, including Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Udaipur, Alwar and Bikaner. RHB official said, \u201cThe deputy housing commissioners were directed to send a proposal after reducing the land price. Many divisions had submitted their proposals. In recent past, a wide gap has come about in RHB rates and market price. We had proposed to take market rates as a benchmark and reduce the RHB prices accordingly. As land prices of RHB are higher, it was expected the house rates will come down by 30-40%,\u201d The move was initiated following urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal\u2019s direction, as due to prolonged slump in the real estate market, many buyers have not shown interest in RHB houses, and many houses remain unsold. In the past, RHB has made several attempts to sell its flats. However, all efforts were futile as not many buyers showed interest to purchase its properties. In 2017, the RHB shortlisted properties (flats of different sizes) in Pratap Nagar, Jaipur, for selling over the counter. Unlike the earlier system of allotting houses through a draw of lots, wherein buyers had to wait for months, people can purchase RHB houses and take possession in a single day, after depositing the house cost at the counter. \u201cNot many people came forward to buy these flats.

A day ago, these men attempted to kill the mahant and stabbed him with a knife. Ramjivan Das, who was referred and admitted in Udaipur Civil Hospital, is better now and out of danger, Pratapgarh SP Anil Beniwal said. A special investigation team, FSL experts and a dog squad visited the crime spot and recreated the scene for detailed investigation. The SP said that an inquiry is already underway and the assailants would be nabbed soon. Mahant Ramjivan Das was going to attend the nature's call around 3.30 am when two men barged into the temple and held him. They doused him with kerosene oil kept inside the room and set him on fire. The priest jumped into the temple kund (pond) to save himself while the assailants fled. After getting information, Dhariyawad SHO Dungar Singh arrived on the crime spot. The mahant was treated at the nearest hospital and later referred to Udaipur. He has sustained severe burn injuries on the upper portion of the body and hands. On Thursday morning too, two men had entered the temple in odd hours and when Ramjivan Das questioned them, they asked mobile charger and when he said there was no charger, they tried to stab him. A police complaint was made by Ramjivan Das against unknown men then too. Legislator Gautamlal Meena had visited to inquire about his wellbeing after the stabbing incident on Thursday. Ramjivan Das is said to be quite popular in the area for his simplicity. Large number of devotees who come to the temple situated near triveni sangam (confluence of 3 rivers) also meet the priest who has vast knowledge on spirituality. The attacks on Mahant thus incited a spur of outrage and locals demanded immediate arrest of the accused.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

A total of 1,509 rape cases have been registered in past four months in Rajasthan this year, recording a significant high, compared to 1,312 cases in 2018 in the same period. The Alwar gang-rape case may have stirred the conscience of the state, but the figures indicate that successive governments have little to show up for women\u2019s security, as rape cases have been steadily rising. The 15 per cent spike in the figures falls flat on the much-touted efforts by the government to curb crimes against women. There is also a very high pending percentage in rape cases reported this year. For instance, of the 1,509 cases registered this year, 858 cases are pending, while FR (Final Report) was submitted in 302 cases and chargesheets were filed in 349 cases. A senior police official attributed the steep rise in figures to high registration of the cases at the police stations. \u201cFor past four months, all police stations were told that no complainant should be turned down and an FIR must be registered without dilly-dallying. The increase in figure also shows that cases are being registered by the police,\u201d official said, adding that decoy operations conducted by the PHQ led to the increase in cases. The police\u2019 claims about cases being easily registered at police stations are contradicted by a series of events that followed soon after a young Dalit girl in Alwar was gang-raped by four men in front of her husband on April 26. Despite her constant pleadings, the police dragged its feet in filing the case, compelling her to go through worst ordeal which allowed the accused to make extortion calls to her. The gang-rape case offers a study of difficulties faced by rape-survivors in registering FIRs. \u201cThe government and the police have said multiple times that FIRs should be registered without delay, even if it means increase in numbers,\u201d claimed the official, adding that a new deputy SP (DSP) rank official will be posted in each district for women\u2019s security.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Offences under other major IPC sections also increased by over 13 per cent. The state over the past few months has witnessed heinous incidents of rape, brazen shootouts, clashes and loots. The new regime is facing backlash for the lawlessness and disorder spreading on the state\u2019s streets. From January to April this year, the Rajasthan police registered total 62,666 IPC offences including murder, attempt to murder, loot, rape, abduction, theft etc. Compared to 55,102 cases registered last year during the same period, there is a clear increase of 13.73 per cent in serious offences. The serious offences like murder, attempt to murder, loot, burglary and theft have also shot up in the state. With the CM Ashok Gehlot holding the home portfolio, the rising crime graph doesn\u2019t augur well for the new dispensation. While the Rajasthan police have attributed easy registration of crime behind the steep increase in crime rates, the spurt in rape cases paints a sorry picture of the state. For past four months, crimes against women have been rising steadily, showing an unprecedented increase of 40.56 per cent. Between January to April in 2018, the Rajasthan police registered 7,764 cases of crimes against women. For the same period of time in 2019 the number of cases filed was 10,913. The Rajasthan police\u2019s crime records show that it registered 1,509 rape cases in 2019, compared to 1,312 in previous year\u2019s initial four months. The increase of 15.02 indicate how unsafe the state continued to be for the women despite several officials claiming that many rape cases culminate in FRs (final reports) as they are false and filed with a sole aim for petty gains. Another shameful topic in Rajasthan police\u2019s list include rampant incidents of women being abducted and kidnapped. The figures reveal that in 2019, total 1,706 women were abducted, a horrifying increase of over 20 percent from 1,415 cases that were reported in 2018. Meanwhile, a senior official said that many of these rape cases turned out to be fasle. \u201cWe have made sustained efforts to ensure that all FIRs are registered. We have time and again directed to all SHOs that FIRs should be filed, our concern is that all cases should be probed. The crime graph has increased because registration of crime has become easy,\u201d said the official. Leader of opposition and former BJP home minister, Gulab Chand Kataira told TOI that the increase in the crime is failure of law and order machinery. \u201cDuring BJP government rule, I used to sit down with the senior police officials and analyse each district individually. A monthly ranking from SHO to SP was conducted,\u201d he said, adding that CM Gehlot has not been able to monitor or supervise the police due to which the crime has increased by leaps and bounds. \u201cEven in major cities of the state like Jaipur and Jodhpur, the crime rate is at an alarmingly high level,\u201d he said.
