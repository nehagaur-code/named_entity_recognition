Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Following the announcement of setting up of GIDA in the 2015-16 budget, the Gujarat Industrial Development Board (GIDB) has spent a sum of around Rs 10 crore to prepare a feasibility report for developing islands from the tourism and security point of view. However, little progress was made after that. \u201cThe PMO has directed to the state government to establish the Island Development Authority as soon as possible.

Officials fear that the bird, reported missing since December 2018, has flown over neighbouring Rajasthan or, worse, crossed the border to Pakistan. Gujarat is precariously placed with regard to the critically endangered GIB. With only six birds, all females, left in the state, it is literally on verge of extinction. Deputy conservator of forest, Kutch (West), B J Asari, said the lone male bird was a sub-adult and, before it went out of sight, had started showing signs it was ready for mating. \"According to an internal report submitted by search teams formed to locate the male GIB, the lone male bird was spotted in Nakhatrana from where it moved to Banni in Kutch. There is a possibility that it has moved to Rajasthan or Pakistan,\" said Asari. Past studies have revealed that the GIBs from Naliya in Kutch have crossed over to Pakistan. The 2017 International Union for Conservation for Nature Red List warned that \"high intensity poaching still continues in Pakistan, where 49 birds were hunted of 63 that were sighted over a period of four years\". With remote chances of the male GIB being found this season, the forest officials admit the state is at mercy of Rajasthan to save the GIB. \"With GIB population down to a single digit in state, Gujarat will be forced to request Rajasthan to part with one male GIB to conserve the bird. We are also planning to set up our own breeding centre in Kutch for which we will need two male GIBs for captive breeding,\" said a senior forest official. Gujarat government has also decided to set up it's own captive breeding center in Kutch. \"Gujarat is very serious about GIB conservation. The lone male bird going missing has proved to be a major setback for our conservation efforts. We have identified a site for breeding center. The department is also likely to seek assistance from Abu Dhabi for captive breeding,\" said a top forest official.

The security provided to Manji Solanki of Jalila village in Botad district's Ranpur taluka (tehsil), who had been attacked thrice earlier, had been withdrawn while he had requested for police protection again, which was not given. His family refused to accept his body after post-mortem at the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital and demanded they be given security cover. Manjibhai's son Tushar Solanki told reporters here: \"We won't take the body till we are given protection. We also want that action should be taken against police personnel who did not provide us security though we had asked for it\". Botad Superintendent of Police Harshad Mehta confirmed to reporters that his office did receive an application from Manjibhai for security on June 6 and the police were examining the threat perception to him. He had been given police protection on March 3, 2018, after the last attack on him, but this was subsequently withdrawn. Solanki was allegedly attacked with clubs and iron pipes by the inmates of a car who first knocked him down when he was returning home on a motorcycle on Wednesday. The police said Solanki died on way when he was being taken to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital. He also agreed that Manji was attacked on four occasions and that the accused persons in all the attacks, including the one on Wednesday, were the same. Tushar Solanki said the upper caste members were angry with his father since he used to fight cases of caste atrocities against the Dalit community. \"This is why my father had also applied for a weapon licence, besides asking for security,\" he said. Meanwhile, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, who did not react to this incident, said at a meeting of the monitoring committee on atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes that the police should initiate stern action in atrocity cases. He instructed district collectors concerned to ensure an atmosphere of amity and harmony in 32 villages and 20 mohallas where the Dalits lived under police protection. Independent Dalit MLA from Vadgam Jignesh Mevani, who was not called for this meeting, dashed off a letter to Rupani expressing concern over the situation of Dalits in the State. Mevani said the police galvanized into action only after an incident took place, but could not prevent it. Congress MLAs Naushad Solanki, Shailesh Parmar and Vasrambhai Patel called on the family of Solanki at the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital and expressed solidarity with them. Later, BJP legislator Pradip Parmar and former MLA R.M. Patel also met them.

Advocate Hemang Shah, who was tasked by the HC to prepare the report and make recommendations for the safety of Asiatic lions, cited nine different things that endanger the big cats. He has not only suggested shifting of the railway tracks, but also stopping trains from plying at night. He highlighted how the chain-link fencing hampers the movement of lions. He also said that the proposal for elevated tracks would not be feasible because so much construction would be detrimental to the wildlife. Hence, the only option available is to shift the tracks and stop trains from plying at night, when lions are out hunting. He mentioned that most of the 20 trains that pass every day, do so after sunset. He stated that these are goods train and commercial interests need to be sacrificed to save lions. The amicus curiae suggested radio collaring all lions and tracking them by GPS to be able to notice their movements near railway tracks. Shah suggested strict action against those who do not cover open wells. \u201cProtection of lions and other animals in the area should prevail over the interests of such well owners,\u201d he said. He has also suggested stringent action against farmers who protect their fields by setting up electric fences. He suggested quick trials against such offenders to prevent the electrocution of lions. The amicus has suggested infusing animals to the Gir forest as the food chain in the area is depleted. He has suggested that roads be properly lit at night for traffic. Trackers should be provided walkie-talkies and there should be more guards.

The officer said that the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams had left the next day and teams from Vadodara and Rajkot were also told to leave the area.

A bench of Justices Deepak Gupta and Suya Kant asked the commission to file a response as to why simultaneous polls for the two Rajya Sabha seats could not be conducted as pleaded by the petitioner. The two seats fell vacant after the election of BJP chief Amit Shah and Smriti Irani to the Lok Sabha. The petition, filed by the leader of opposition in the Gujarat Assembly, Paresh Dhanani, sought the quashing of the EC\u2019s June 15 notification treating the two seats as stray vacancies to warrant separate elections. He said holding of separate elections for the two seats would deny Congress one of the seats which it is entitled to according to its strength in the assembly and by the law mandating proportional representation with single transferable vote for the Rajya Sabha. Senior advocate Vivek Tankha, appearing for the petitioner, said there is no SC verdict on the issue but the Delhi high court had passed an order in a similar case. The court, after a brief hearing, said the issue had to be examined and adjudicated and posted it for June 25. The court said it has to be decided whether the two vacancies in the Rajya Sabha are casual or statutory. At present, in the 182-member Gujarat assembly, the BJP has 100 MLAs while the Congress has 71. If separate polls are held for the two seats, the BJP will win both. The petition filed through advocate Varun K Chopra argued that according to the Representation of the People Act, representatives of each state to the Rajya Sabha shall be elected by the members of assembly by the system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote. \u201cThe conduct of elections for each vacancy separately would only lead to one result, that is, the victory of the party which commands a simple majority. This would turn the very objective of proportional representation on its head,\u201d Dhanani said in his petition. tnn Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Traffic at kankaria road": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/traffic-at-kankaria-road/articleshow/57356011.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Arjun Kapoor": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/arjun-kapoors-funny-reaction-on-malaika-aroras-new-post/videoshow/69877017.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Deadly truck": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/deadly-truck/articleshow/62966102.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "'Batti Gul Meter Chalu': All you need to know about the Shahid Kapoor-Shraddha Kapoor starrer": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/batti-gul-meter-chalu-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-shahid-kapoor-shraddha-kapoor-starrer/photo-yami-gautam-looks-absolutely-ravishing-in-a-black-dress/photostory/65791732.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Gujarat high court orders check-up for public health facilities": {"datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/high-court-orders-check-up-for-public-health-facilities/articleshow/69866015.cms", "time": "2019-06-20 08:34:00", "description": "AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday ordered the state government to place before it details of the Centre\u2019s funding for the state\u2019s healthcare sector and the state\u2019s budgetary allocations for it.

The petitioner cited reports of the central government to emphasize the fact that average spending on health amounts to 58% of the average family income in Gujarat. The high court has asked the petitioner to come up with details on budgetary allocations for the healthcare sector in other states. Further hearing has been posted for July 1. The PIL contended, \u201cThe healthcare infrastructure of this state is crippling as a result of which the health of the ordinary citizen is in serious jeopardy.\u201d Gajera has sought the court\u2019s directions to the government to provide all healthcare facilities at primary health centres, sub-centres, community health centres as well as district hospitals in tribal and non-tribal rural areas. The petitioner has demanded that health facilities adhere to the Indian Public Health Standards in terms of infrastructure, manpower, availability of necessary drugs and equipment, and services such as ambulance, water supply, electricity, and bio-waste management. The PIL demanded the formation of a special committee of health experts to recommend measures to deal with the deficiencies in the healthcare system. The petitioner cited the 2017 Rural Health Statistics Report to highlight the dearth of doctors, particularly specialists, in health centres and hospitals in rural areas.

During their six-month investigation, ACB officials found that Detroja had bought the land in a period of two years, when he was MD of GLDC. ACB officials also informed income tax officials, to initiate proceedings against Detroja for his unaccounted income. Officials say Detroja had amassed properties worth more than Rs 100 crore. The GLDC scam came to light after it emerged that false bills worth hundreds of crores were generated and the money was siphoned off during the state government\u2019s campaign to deepen ponds and lakes ahead of the monsoon last year. The government in November 2018 decided to close down the public sector unit after failing to control the rampant corruption in it. The comptroller and auditor general of India (CAG) also reported massive irregularities in GLDC. In April 2018, the state ACB raided the GLDC headquarters in Gandhinagar and seized Rs 56.50 lakh in unaccounted cash. After the raid, five GLDC officials, including Detroja and joint director K C Parmar, were arrested for taking bribes from farmers who had applied for government grants under schemes executed by the corporation. A case under the Prevention Of Corruption Act, 1988, was lodged against Detroja and others. The probe revealed that Detroja and his aides allegedly took commissions from farmers to clear grants allocated by the state government for farm ponds and soil tests.

Prof Errol D'Souza, director of IIM-A, could not be contacted for his comment on Rai\u2019s appointment. The IIM Ahmedabad website has already put up a faculty page for Rai, which shows him as part of the public management think tank, Public Systems Group (PSG), and also mentions his official email id. Rai, who had probed the 2005 Sohrabuddin Shaikh fake encounter case and had arrested fellow IPS officers D G Vanzara, Rajkumar Pandian and Dinesh M N in 2007, was suspended from service in December 2018. Before his suspension, he had appealed for voluntary retirement upon reaching the age of 50 years, under the provisions of All India Services (Death-Cum-Retirement Benefit) Rules, 1958. But the Union government had rejected his application for retirement. Rai went to the CAT and then Gujarat high court over the issue, but the Union government, meanwhile, issued a chargesheet against him for handing over charge without due authorization and abdication of office, and then suspended him. Sources said that Rai\u2019s appointment at IIM-A took place in May during a faculty recruitment seminar. \u201cRai was found to have academic qualification and experience required for the job,\u201d said an official close to development, claiming that Rai\u2019s ongoing legal battle has little bearing on the appointment. The appointment fulfils the IPS officer\u2019s long pending ambition for a second career innings in academics. Earlier in 2014, Rai had requested the government to relieve him so that he could join the IIM Udaipur as a professor in business policy and strategy. His request was turned down. Rai, 53, was posted outside Gujarat ever since 2014, and his last posting was IGP and principal of Counter Insurgency and Anti-Terrorism (CIAT) School of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh. He had hit the headlines in 2014, when as chief vigilance officer at Uranium Corporation of India at Jadugoda in Jharkhand he had found irregularities and had submitted the findings to CBI. He was charge-sheeted for the unauthorized probe, but received reprieve from CAT\u2019s Hyderabad branch in 2017. Rai\u2019s academic profile cites his educational qualification as BTech, PGPPM, PG in Patents Law and PhD. Rai, who was at loggerheads with the state government, spent the better part of the last decade pursuing his academic interests. He was also named in a copy case in his LLB examination from which he was cleared by the Gujarat high court due to lack of evidence in 2008.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The HC issued notices to the government of Gujarat and the 10 accused, who want to return to Sabarmati Jail, and posted a further hearing for July 9. On June 1, the special judge ordered the Bhopal central jail superintendent and IG (Prisons) in MP to shift 10 accused, including Safdar Nagori, to Ahmedabad on their request to face the rest of the trial here. They were shifted to MP jail after their conviction in a terrorism case more than a year ago. In its order, the trial court issued production warrants under Section 267 of the CrPC to lodge 10 accused in Sabarmati jail by June 20. This needed to be done by revoking Section 268 of the CrPC, imposed by the MP government, to lift restrictions on their movement.

The trial court warned of initiating contempt proceedings against officials, if they failed to follow the order. The MP government challenged the trial court\u2019s order before the HC, insisting that the trial court cannot issue production warrants before Section 268 of CrPc is revoked, and cannot initiate contempt of court proceedings.

Navrangpura police sought five-day custodial interrogation of Shah to probe his past behaviour with women and for verification by the FSL. It was argued that if Shah was not sent to remand, the investigation would be hampered and the accused would get the benefit of inadequate investigations during the trial. Shah was arrested on Wednesday on the basis of CCTV footage from a PG facility for women in Navrangpura. He was seen molesting a sleeping girl and has been charged under Section 354 of the IPC. The police sought remand to know whether Shah, who worked as a food delivery worker for the last year, was in contact with other women through social media. It was required to find out whether he spoke indecently manner with any of these women in the past. Police also wanted to know which other women\u2019s accommodations Shah had delivered food to.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

Patel expressed his irritation at being called senior leader repeatedly by advocate Jain and put an end to this by asking, \u201cWhy do you address me as senior leader all the time? I have come here as Ahmed Mohammed Patel.\u201d Patel did not lose his sense of humour amid the volley of questions. When he was questioned on whether he watches television, he shot back, \u201cHardly, because there is nothing to watch on television.\u201d When he was questioned during which period he held the post of Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee, Patel looked at senior counsel Nirupam Nanavati, who represents Rajput, and said, \u201cMr Nanavati knows it very well as he was my general secretary.\u201d It needs mention that Nanavati used to hold top positions in Congress before he deserted the party and started representing BJP men as clients instead. To the question whether he is close to All India Congress Committee (AICC) president, Rahul Gandhi, Patel got irked and questioned the lawyer, \u201cWhat do you mean by close?\u201d When advocate Jain questioned Patel whether his proposers, nearly 30-40 in different sets of nomination, caused trouble for him, he said, \u201cThey may have created problems as some of them left the party.\u201d Immediately, Patel asked the lawyer, \u201cI know why are you asking these questions? The lawyer replied, \u201cI know how to ask. You know how to avoid questions.\u201d Patel had filed his RS nomination on July 26, 2017. A day earlier, a meeting was held at Congress headquarters where the party had issued a whip that all Congress MLAs should vote for Ahmed Patel. On being questioned who all were present in the meeting and where did he sit, Patel replied, \u201cNaturally on the dais.\u201d His irritation was visible and Justice Bela Trivedi also commented on his losing temperament and told advocate Jain, \u201cHe felt offended when you put this question.\u201d Patel\u2019s questioning is to continue on Friday.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

In 2018, the Jagannath Temple lost three elephants, bringing down their count to 17. Traditionally, 18 elephants are part of the 1.5km Rath Yatra procession. The procession will be carried out on the traditional route on July 4 this year.

The ritualistic puja of the elephants takes place two days ahead to the procession, after which they are painted for the occasion. Dr R K Sahu, superintendent of Kankaria Zoo, said a lot depends on the temperament of the elephants. \u201cThe environmental conditions are different, the place is different and the temperature can certainly play a role. A committee consisting of experts will take a call after a thorough examination of the animals. If distressed, the animals can be a danger at such a public event,\u201d he said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party.

The HC has sought details on what steps each of the municipal corporations and municipalities have taken to end the practice of manual scavenging and which surveys have been conducted to know the present situation. The HC has also sought to know whether vigilance committee and a state monitoring committee were formed under the provisions of the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993.

The NGO had filed the PIL in 2016 in the interest of 152 families of manhole workers who lost their lives in course of their work. The families were entitled to compensation of Rs 10 lakh according the a Supreme Court order in 2014. The PIL alleged that the state government did not follow the SC order, and hence it sought the high court\u2019s direction to the government to identify families of the deceased manhole workers and award them compensation of Rs 10 lakh. The PIL also urged the HC to direct the government to appoint and designate a nodal agency to identify the families of victims since 1993 as the order passed by the apex court. Before this, there was a series of PILs filed by activists as well as the high court itself for proper implementation of the law which was meant to eradicate the inhuman practice of manual scavenging.

What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

In refusing protection from arrest to Altafhussain Shaikh, the court said, \u201cIt is required to curb such antisocial activities to maintain social environment.\u201d According to the public prosecutor, Sudhir Brahmbhatt, the court took into consideration that there were five other FIRs against him for bootlegging. The court felt it necessary to inquire into how the accused received the liquor and what his modus operandi was. The court further said that from the nature of the offence and as the Gujarat has recently enacted stricter prohibition laws, the court was not inclined to exercise its judicial discretion in favour of the accused.
