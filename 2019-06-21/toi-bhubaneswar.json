Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

A notification issued by the Khurda collector, Bhupendra Singh Poonia, on Monday said a number of fatal accidents had occurred on the flyovers between Khandagiri and Rasulgarh in the recent past and it was imperative to prevent helmetless bikers from getting on these structures. There are six flyovers between Khandagiri and Rasulgarh on the NH-16. Seven people were killed and 20 injured in separate accidents on the flyovers on this stretch over the past two months. The district administration said helmetless bikers were more vulnerable to accidents on flyovers because of thin traffic and more scope for speeding. \"We have started asking helmetless bikers to not use flyovers. They will be slapped with fines and diverted to the traffic-heavy service roads otherwise,\" regional transport officer (zone-2) Sanjay Kumar Behera said. Some road-safety experts, however, questioned the rationale behind prohibiting helmetless bike riders from using flyovers only. \"Use of helmet is compulsory on any public road, be it a flyover or a highway. It seems that the administration wants the people to use helmets only on flyovers,\" said Prateek Ray, a road-safety engineer, said. Commissioner Satyajit Mohanty said police had been conducting crackdowns on those riding bikes without helmets on all roads. \"We do not discriminate between flyovers and other roads. Our drive against helmetless bikers is on across the city. We have been taking steps to minimize road accidents. Black spots have been identified on the flyovers and NHAI officials have been asked to take steps to bring down the speed of the vehicles at the accident-prone spots,\" he said. The capital has seen a rise in road deaths in 2018 as compared to 2017. While 185 people died in accidents in Bhubaneswar in 2017, the figure shot up to 226 last year.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

It must be mentioned that the BJD president has been advocating women\u2019s empowerment at various forums and had also taken up the issue of women\u2019s reservation in Parliament and state assemblies during Modi\u2019s first term as Prime Minister. True to his word, Naveen\u2019s party fielded seven women candidates, or one-third of the 21 Lok Sabha seats that went to polls in Odisha. Out of the seven, five women managed to win. Reviving the \u2018one nation, one election\u2019 idea mooted by Modi in the past, Naveen said, \u201cAs frequent elections affect development climate, it is better to have simultaneous elections in the country.\u201d In 2004, Naveen had advanced the Odisha assembly election to sync it with the Lok Sabha election, despite the fact that his tenure as chief minister was to end a year later. Since then Odisha has been witnessing assembly and Lok Sabha elections together. Reiterating his demand for special category status for Odisha \u2014 which he had raised during his meeting with Modi on Tuesday \u2014 Naveen proposed to include natural calamity as a criteria for granting such a status. \u201cAs an interim measure, states hit by major natural calamities may be declared as \u2018Special Focus States\u2019 and granted benefits of Special Category Status for a specific period,\u201d the statement added.

The 27-year-old belonged to the 14 Rashtriya Rifles (RR). A pall of gloom descended over Sahoo\u2019s village of Badasuanlo in Kamakhyanagar block after news of his death reached here. His mortal remains were scheduled to reach the village late on Tuesday evening. Nine soldiers, including Sahoo, and two civilians were injured in Pulwama\u2019s Arihal when a group of terrorists targeted a routine Army patrol of 44 RR, with which he was associated at that time, with an IED. Another jawan, havildar Amarjeet Kumar, also succumbed to his injuries. Santosh Kumar Sahoo, father of the martyr, said, \u201cAn Army officer from Kolkata called and said my son had been hospitalised. He breathed his last at 2.50 in the morning, the officer said.\u201d Sahoo\u2019s father added, \u201cMy son had trained in Bengaluru for one-and-a-half years and then stayed in Kolkata for three years.\u201d The jawan had visited home in the last week of May and left for Jammu & Kashmir on June 2. \u201cLittle did I know that it would be his last visit home. It is a great loss for all of us but I am proud that my son sacrificed his life for the country,\u201d said the grieving father. Sahoo was born on June 4, 1992, and had joined the Army on March 20, 2015. On June 1, he was transferred to 14 RR in Jammu & Kashmir from Kolkata. He had earlier worked in the Army Service Corps in Bengaluru. Ashok Sahoo, a close friend of the deceased, told TOI, \u201cEvery villager in Badasuanlo is mourning his death. We are in shock.\u201d \u201cHe was brave, nice and gentle. Everybody liked him. His death is a great loss for us. His soul will rest in peace when the government takes action against terrorists,\u201d he added. The sub-collector of Kamakhyanagar, Bishnu Prasad Acharya, said Sahoo would receive a full guard of honour. Sahoo\u2019s elder brother, Alok, (30), works in a private company in Bengaluru and his younger sister, Subhalaxmi (21), is married.

When she does, she clutches a pillow for comfort. While a few months ago, her face would light up at the sight of the Puri beach, now even the mention of it sends a shiver down her spine. Like Visakha, thousands of children in Odisha are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) more than a month after cyclonic storm Fani hit the state on May 3. In Puri, where the cyclone made landfall and damage was the greatest, more than 10,000 children below 17 years of age are undergoing psychosocial counseling after they started showing symptoms ranging from anxiety and stress to insomnia. Experts have warned that it might take a long time for an entire generation to overcome the mental trauma they have suffered in the aftermath of Fani which claimed 64 lives. At least 300 counselors from six non-profit organisations - aided by the government - have set up temporary centres in Puri alone to provide mental health intervention to affected children. While much of the infrastructure damaged by Fani is being rebuilt and those displaced have returned home, memories of the raging storm still haunt them. \"We were without food, power and water for several days. I never want to live through that again,\" Soumendra, a 12-year-old boy, who has been undergoing counseling, told TOI. Having come face-to-face with the monstrosity of the sea, he is scared to venture out alone. \"I feel safe here. The sound of the waves crashing onto the shore disturbs me,\" he said. It is this fear that gives Soumendra sleepless nights, a common symptom of PTSD. \"Children with PTSD fear that they would have to go through the same experience. If the anxiety persists for a prolonged period, they may slip into acute depression,\" Suvendu Mishra, general secretary of Indian Psychiatric Society (Odisha state branch), said. Mishra added that around 35% to 40% of the children in affected areas showed such symptoms and it may take anything between three and six months to fully recover.

The move comes after the BMC's squads implementing the no-plastic rule faced protests from traders while conducting raids on shops. The awareness drive will be conducted in the BMC office in phases. Its objective will be to ensure that traders don't argue with members of the enforcement squads during raids on shops. \"The traders are still not aware of why the raids are being conducted and which type of polythene can be used and which can't. They (traders) think we are seizing all varieties of polythene bags from them, which is not the case,\" said BMC deputy commissioner Prabir Khillar. According to the guideline of the Central Pollution Control Board, the manufacture, sale and use of polythene bags of thickness below 50 micron is not allowed. Khillar said very few traders understood the guideline and almost none stocked carry-bags of thickness of 50 micron or more. \"The awareness camp will make our work easy and the traders won't have to pay penalty,\" he added. The BMC has so far seized 3.5 quintal of the banned polythene and collected Rs 40,000 in fine. The BMC's commissioner Samarth Verma has directed the zonal deputy commissioners of the three zones to conduct raids on fish, meat and fruit markets every Wednesday. Vendors at these markets mostly use very thin carry-bags to sell their items. Thin polythene is hazardous to the environment. The BMC has also started a process to identify polythene bag manufacturers by getting information from wholesalers and traders. At present, the BMC doesn't have comprehensive data on polythene-makers. On October 2, 2018, the state imposed a ban on the sale, use and manufacture of plastic bags with less than 50 micron thickness in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Puri, Rourkela, Sambalpur and Berhampur. Raids were conducted on shops for some days but then they petered out.

Coming under pressure, the state government had selected a land at Gothapatna in Khurda district for the purpose. But nothing has been done so far except selection of the location. The state government had created Rama Devi Women's University at Bhubaneswar, Gangadhar Meher University at Sambalpur and Khallikote Cluster University at Berhampur on May 30, 2015. \u201cThe last two universities have already received land much earlier, but the government is yet to give any official communication to the state\u2019s first women university about finalisation of the land,\u201d said a senior teacher of the university. The government had selected two lands on outskirts of the city, but the university had opposed the selection due to its remote location. On January 30 last year, the higher education department had issued a notification to identify a 30-acre land inside Utkal University for the second campus of the RD University. But students had opposed the government notification and vehemently protested it. Later, the government had dropped the idea to take Utkal land and formed an extended committee on February 19 last year to identify land for the RD University. The committee had submitted its report on March 15 last year regarding the land for the second campus. It has proposed for a land at Gothapatna, but no progress on the issue after that. \u201cThe land at Gothapatna has 78 acres, but there is no clarity about how many acres have been allotted for the university. It will take another round of discussion before handing it over to the institution,\u201d said a senior higher education department official. Padmaja Mishra, vice chancellor of the university, said she did not get any official communication regarding the allotment of the land for the second campus. \u201cAfter getting land, we will make plan for construction,\u201d she added. The present campus is spread over 22 acres of land near Rupali Square. As it is an affiliating university and 48 women's colleges under its jurisdiction, it gets immense load of the colleges along with PG and M Phil programmes. \u201cWe have not started our PhD programmes due to lack of infrastructure. We don\u2019t have land to set up good laboratories and research centres to start doctoral programmes. Space is needed for starting new departments like Business Administration and Journalism,\u201d said a senior teacher. The university cannot host inter-college or inter-university sports meet due to lack of a good playground and a sports complex. \u201cBesides, we need staff quarters and guest house inside the campus like other universities,\u201d said the teacher.

The chief minister proposed that his demand be accepted until the Centre includes natural calamity as an indicator for according special category status to a state.

Though they had applied for NOCs, we rejected their applications as the hospitals failed to meet even the basic fire-safety requirements.\" The DGP further said it was not possible to seal the hospital buildings as they rendered emergency services. \"We will constantly monitor them until they have the required arrangements in place,\" he added. A fire services personnel said the inspection was aimed to make hospitals comply with fire-safety norms for the safety of patients, visitors, doctors, staff and train the staff in fire-fighting. The fire services officials taught evacuation exercises to the doctors and the staff and sensitised them on how to use the fire-safety devices. \"Hospitals need sufficient time to install the requisite fire-fighting mechanisms because the process demands a structural renovation.

With Naveen elected from both Bijepur and Hinjili in the assembly election, he had to vacate one. He chose to retain Hinjili, his traditional seat, necessitating a bypoll in Bijepur. And given that the constituency had voted for Naveen, the byelection has turned into a prestige battle for the BJD. Even though official notification for the byelection is yet to be issued, the BJD and the BJP have started their groundwork. BJD insiders said Naveen may meet senior party leaders from western Odisha to discuss strategy for Bijepur after returning from New Delhi on Saturday. \u201cPeople of Bijepur have blessed the BJD.

The two are likely to discuss enhancing Odisha's footprint in the steel sector besides the progress of the proposed petroleum, chemicals and petrochemicals investment region in Paradip, which envisages an investment of Rs one lakh crore in the next few years. It would be the two leaders first formal business meeting after Narendra Modi government came to power at the Centre for a second time and Naveen Patnaik took oath as Odisha chief minister for a fifth term. The BJD termed the upcoming meeting as a natural process in state's interest. \"Odisha being a steel hub, it is natural for the chief minister to meet the Union steel minister to take forward the state's interest,\" said BJD spokesperson Pratap Keshari Deb. In his last visit to the state on June 8, Dharmendra had said the Centre will help to develop the state as a global hub of ancillary industry in the steel sector.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

According to the central pollution control board (CPCB), plastic bags of below 50 micron thickness cannot be manufactured as thinner bags pose a major threat to environment due to its non-disposability. BMC commissioner Samarth Verma said the wholesalers have been identified and raids will continue. The manufacturers are yet to be identified, he added. \"We have activated the intelligence to tap the locations of plastic bag making units. We have a dedicated officer who oversees the seizure and raid exercises,\" the commissioner said. The BMC has been conducting raids at the markets and malls in the city. So far, it has seized three quintal of plastic-carry bags, less than 50 micron thickness, from traders, shopkeepers and vendors. Initially, the raids were carried out for some days but they had suddenly stopped. Additional chief secretary (forest and environment) Suresh Chandra Mohapatra said the process was delayed due to elections and Cyclone Fani. BMC deputy commissioner Prabir Khillar, who is the nodal officer of the ban enforcement, said the manufacturers will come under the radar soon. \"I have asked those working in the enforcement wing to find out the manufacturing units. We will also try to obtain information from suppliers and wholesalers. Around 60 kg of polythene bags were seized from a single wholesaler. We have so far collected a penalty of Rs 30,000,\" Khillar said. The officer added that besides vegetable, fruit and grocery markets, every hotel and mall will be raided and the process will continue till all plastic-carry bags are removed. \"Once our raids are over, we will keep tabs on the suppliers to check whether they clandestinely sale such bags from their old stock,\" the officer said. After Cyclone Fani, polythene bags were widely used as there was no alternative. Similarly, after Cyclone Titli had hit the state in October last year, \"banned\" polythene bags had come handy while distributing cooked food among cyclone-affected people. The government had no choice but to use them in the absence of any other alternative during the tragedy. Mostly, food packets in poly bags were distributed in the Purusottampur block in Ganjam. The state government had banned plastic bags with less than 50 microns thickness in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Puri, Rourkela, Sambalpur and Berhampur since October 2, 2018.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar.

Finance minister Niranjan Pujari will present the budget on June 28. Though the details of the budget were not disclosed, sources said the social sector allocation (provision for various welfare schemes), Fani restoration works, Kalia and Mission Shakti will be the priority areas of the annual budget. Earlier, the annual budget for the 2019-20 financial year was estimated at Rs 1.32 lakh crore of which Rs 56,921 crore was presented as vote-on-account for four months (April-July period) before the general election. \u201cThe final budget size will be increased as the state government has made provisions for schemes like (Kalia) Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation and Mission Shakti.

The state cabinet had on May 29 approved a proposal to increase the number of beneficiaries to 75 lakh from 42 lakh farmers\u2019 families already covered under the cash transfer scheme. Though the initial estimate for the Kalia scheme was Rs 4,400 crore, the state government has estimated an additional allocation of Rs 3,234 crore for the scheme. The additional allocation will be made in the annual budget. As Naveen\u2019s cabinet has authorized the women SHGs to do government activities like paddy procurement, supply uniforms to schoolchildren, supply food to patients in hospitals, free mosquito nets among villagers and midday meal worth Rs 1000 crore annually, allocation will be made accordingly in the budget. With cyclonic storm Fani wreaking havoc in 14 districts causing maximum damage to public properties, the government is likely to allocate massive amount for restoration works through various departments. The total loss to public properties and requirement of fund for relief measures has been estimated at Rs 9,336 crore of which the state government has sought Rs 5,228 crore from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).

The situation is totally under control.

The AES is a syndrome that includes several diseases like Japanese encephalitis, meningitis, malaria and typhoid. Children suffering from the disease show symptoms like very high fever, fainting and fits. \u201cUnless and until any virus is detected from litchi we cannot say the fruit is the source or one of the reasons of the disease.

After Vohra\u2019s arrest, Agra police booked him and his known associates including his son Vatsal, wife Rakhi, nephew Prateek, brother-in-law Kaushal and others for their alleged involvement in betting. On Monday, judge Anil Kumar Pundhir rejected Vohra\u2019s bail plea, who was charged for attempt to murder, as he allegedly opened fire on policemen. Further, Vohra was charged for running illegal gambling racket, criminal conspiracy and obstructing policemen from executing their duties. Police are yet to arrest the relatives and associates of Vohra. Several years back, Vohra had gain notoriety for betting on cricket matches. In April, during IPL matches, the gambling racket run by Vohra had deposited Rs 62 lakh in 10 banks, after which police approached banks to freeze the amount.

To make it work, the government approved increasing MBBS seats in the state by 150 and post graduate (MD/MS) intake by 148. But the final call on increasing the exact number of seats would be taken by the Medical Council of India\u2019s (MCI)s board of governors, sources said. \u201cThe government has given in-principle approval for the proposal to implement the quota. Further modalities will be worked out soon,\u201d health secretary Pramod Meherda told TOI. Sources said the government has given its nod to increase MBBS seats at Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Education and Research (VIMSAR), Burla, by 50 from its current capacity of 150. Similarly, 25 seats are going to be added to each of the medical colleges in Koraput, Baripada, Balasore and Balangir, taking the total intake to 125. The move follows a Union government directive wherein 10% EWS quota in general category needs to be implemented in higher education institutions. With the admission process under NEET scheduled to start soon, the states had to send their proposals to the MCI so that they can sync the intake capacity in various medical institutions with the Centre\u2019s rules. Since the number of seats at SCB Medical College, Cuttack and MKCG Medical College and Hospital, Berhampur are already 250 each \u2014 the maximum allowed to any medical college under MCI norms \u2014 increasing their intake would not be possible, a government official said. The state has also given its nod to increase post graduate seats at SCB, MKCG and VIMSAR by 148. If the MCI board approves the proposal, the number of MBBS seats in state-run medical institutions will go up from 1,050 to 1,200 and PG intake from 468 to 616. The state had to come up with a revised proposal after withdrawing an earlier approval on seat increase sent to the MCI board on June 4 as the same was not as per the medical education regulator\u2019s suggested formula. In the withdrawn approval, the state had suggested increasing MBBS seats by 105 and PG seats by 50. It must be mentioned that AIIMS Bhubaneswar, a central government-run institute, has already decided to increase its intake from 100 to 125 this year.

The Gujarat government has launched a massive evacuation exercise to shift people from low-lying areas. \"The chief secretary of Gujarat had called up to discuss measures that need to be taken before the cyclone makes landfall.

He added that authorities from Gujarat had sought advice on the evacuation process and the Odisha's experience in dealing with cyclones like Fani and Titli. He said Gujarat officials are in constant touch with Odisha's disaster management authorities. Odisha recently drew praise from both within and outside the country for successfully evacuating more than 12 lakh people to safety before the extremely severe Cyclone Fani hit the state on May 3. This resulted in reducing human casualty. The state has built around 900 multi-purpose cyclone shelters in coastal districts and has 20 well-trained units of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) ready with modern equipment at their disposal to tackle disasters. Sources said if required, Odisha could send its ODRAF and fire services personnel to Gujarat to help in relief and rescue operations. \"The Centre has deployed adequate teams of National Disaster Response Force in Gujarat to take care of the situation. I don't think they will need our manpower. If the Centre asks us for help, we will send our teams immediately,\" said a senior state government official. Last August, the ODRAF and fire service teams were engaged in relief and rescue operations during the floods in Kerala.

Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

According to the recent Crime Branch letter to the SPs, a number of instances were reported where accused persons escaped from the police custody during their transit for appearance in the court. Crime Branch sources said at least 9 arrested persons escaped from the police custody in connection with separate crimes in 2018. \u201cIn cases of heinous offences, including Naxalism, it is a challenge for the police to safely produce the accused persons in court,\u201d additional director general of police (Crime Branch) Santosh Upadhyay said. The Crime Branch\u2019s concern assumes significance as an alleged Maoist had escaped from the police custody in Nuapada district last year, leaving the police red-faced. Manoj Madkami, who was arrested by Nuapada district police in May 2018, jumped the police custody from court premises on September 18, 2018. Madkami is still on the run. The incident had happened when Madkami was being taken back to jail from the court. At least seven cops were suspended for negligence and dereliction of duty. In order to avoid escape of hard core criminals, the Crime Branch has suggested the SPs to produce the former in court through electronic video linkage. Crime Branch said the concerned police stations should move the court, seeking approval to produce the accused via video conference. \u201cWe have electronic video linkage in the jails and courts. Since arrested persons are compulsorily produced in court in regular interval, the apprehension of their escape cannot be ruled out. Police stations should not take the risk of transporting dreaded criminals to court and use the technology for their safe appearance before the judge,\u201d another Crime Branch officer said. Authorities in some jails and courts said the video linkage and internet connectivity was damaged after Cyclone Fani battered Odisha on May 3. Prisons officials said the technicians are already on the job to restore the service. \u201cWe have partly restored the service in some prisons,\u201d a jail officer said.

The Crime Branch has collaborated with the Unicef to train the cops, mostly inspectors and sub-inspectors. A joint team of cyber experts from Delhi and Odisha Crime Branch will educate the participants (IOs) about the evolving cyber threats and solutions during the three-phase training sessions. Crime Branch said the IOs will undergo a test at the end of the training programme and the best three performers will be sent abroad for further training on the skills of probing cyber crimes. DGP R P Sharma, who inaugurated the training programme, expressed concern over the sharp rise in cyber crime cases, including online banking frauds, e-lottery scams, child pornography and offences related to social media in last six years. While only 120 cyber crime cases were registered in Odisha in 2013, the figure touched 867 in 2018. At least 241 cases were already registered in first three months of 2019. \u201cOur personnel will have to develop the expertise to solve cyber cases. Children and women are more vulnerable to cyber offences. Police stations must accept cyber-related complaints and accord priority in solving the cases,\u201d Sharma said. Crime Branch\u2019s additional director general Santosh Upadhyay and inspector general Arun Bothra said the cyber experts of Crime Branch have been extending necessary guidance to the IOs of police stations. \u201cOur sustained efforts on public sensitization programmes and awareness campaigns paid off to a great extent, even though the cyber crime continues to be a challenging area for us. Internet explosion, unchecked use of social media and lack of proper mechanism to prevent the offence are some of the plausible causes of the occurrence of cyber offences,\u201d additional director general of police (Crime Branch) Santosh Upadhyay said. Bothra said the Crime Branch is in touch with the Unicef to establish child-friendly police stations in Odisha. Chief of the Unicef\u2019s field office in Odisha, Monika Nielsen said they would extend all necessary support to the Odisha police in protecting children from the clutches of online crimes. The state police were on their toes following circulation of nude and obscene clips of girls on WhatsApp and Facebook last year. Wary of circulation of obscene photos of girls on social media, DGP Sharma earlier issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) to district SPs, highlighting the methods of investigation and relevant sections of law to deal with the culprits.
