Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

In the last three years, foreign auction houses have earned Rs 6.20 crore by selling heritage furniture items designed by Chandigarh\u2019s creator French architect Le Corbusier, his cousin Pierre Jeanneret and others associated with the founding and planning of the city. In a recent auction of artefacts belonging to the city, furniture items designed by Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret were auctioned for Rs 1.12 crore in New York. Though the UT administration had started working on to stop the auction and had even written to these auction houses, but to no avail. A UT official said they had sought assistance of the French government in preserving city\u2019s heritage buildings and furniture. A letter in this regard was written by UT adviser Manoj Parida to French ambassador Alexandre Ziegler, wherein the UT had asked for help from cultural experts of the French government, he added. The UT administration had even prepared an inventory of as many as 12,793 heritage items belonging to Chandigarh. Notably, the entities include furniture, tapestry, drawings and other things, which were designed, made and used by Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret and others associated with the founding and planning of Chandigarh in the 1950s and 60s, comes under the category of heritage items. Chandigarh reportedly has 12,793 heritage items designed by Corbusier or his team. As per the report, there are 190 categories of the heritage items, including drawings, murals, models, tapestries, chairs and tables. In Chandigarh, UT Government Museum and Art Gallery has possession of a large number of heritage items, including furniture, drawings, murals, models among others, made by Corbusier and his other associates. Besides, Punjab and Haryana civil secretariat, Punjab and Haryana vidhan sabha, Punjab and Haryana high court also have huge stock of heritage furniture, including chairs and tables. Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret had designed these heritage furniture items. Both used to design chairs, tables, stools, and racks for government offices in the late 1950s. The designed furniture lot was replaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, after which the administration had tossed the items in its backyards and stores. Unaware of the furniture\u2019s international worth, most UT departments had auctioned the old furniture thinking it as junk. To preserve its heritage artefacts, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had recently asked the UT administration for taking corrective steps. The ASI director general had advised the UT administration to prepare an inventory of heritage items with subsequent authentication of their authorship. It had also suggested that a museum dedicated to Le Corbusier and his team can be established, which will prevent taking these works of art out of India.

Despite the fact that GMADA claimed to have issued notices to such violators, it has so far failed to take any action to get the government land freed or force the violators to abide by the bylaws. The government departments responsible for defending the government land from being encroached by the residents have been sitting idle and have not taken any concrete action till date. In June last year, MC had conducted a survey and identified around 4000 residents who have violated the norms and have encroached upon the government land. No action has been taken after that and residents have taken the things for granted.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Thereafter, the adjudicating officer imposed a penalty of Rs 2.5 lakh upon him. The appellant then contested that the entire procedure adopted by the said authority was vitiated and the same was liable to be set aside by allowing the appeal. The further argument then was the amount of penalty was disproportionate and therefore was liable to be reduced. Allowing the appeal, the court held that penalty of Rs 75,000 would make the ends of justice meet.

Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.

A complaint was moved to the cops by panchayat secretary Dalbir Singh.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs.

It is well settled that denial of fair trial is crucifixion of human rights. While emphasizing the principle of fair trial and the practice of the same in the course of trial, it is obligatory on the part of the courts to see whether in an individual case or category of cases, because of non-compliance of a certain provision, reversion of judgment of conviction is inevitable or it is dependent on arriving at an indubitable conclusion that substantial injustice has in fact occurred,\u201d observed the HC while allowing DNA of two accused. Justice Raj Shekhar Attri passed the orders while allowing the petition filed by a Sonipat resident and one more accused. Both the petitioners had approached the HC, challenging the order dated April 10 last passed by a trial court in Panchkula through which their application under Section 53-A of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for getting DNA profiling was dismissed. While dismissing their plea, the trial court had observed that the survivor, while stepping into the witness-box, had categorically stated every fact in sequence and now after recording her statement, both the accused have moved the applications, which were nothing but misuse of the process of law. A person cannot be allowed to move application at any stage he likes, the judge had observed. Aggrieved at this, the accused had approached the HC, submitting that the dismissal of their applications amounted to denial of fair trial. After hearing the petition, the HC observed that a criminal trial is a search of truth. \u201cTherefore, a judge has to intervene as and when required, especially to rule out illegalities, irregularities or infirmities and also the inadmissible evidence. Under the provisions of Section 53-A of the CrPC, it is imperative for the prosecution to go in for DNA test. No cogent reason has been assigned by the trial court while dismissing the application,\u201d observed the HC while setting aside the April 10 order. In July last year, a 21-year-old woman had alleged that she was held hostage in a guesthouse in Morni and gang raped by over 40 men. The case had hit national headlines, following which the Panchkula police suspended some officials for negligence in registering an FIR at the women\u2019s police station.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Put in category of \u2018dead\u2019 by the village multipurpose agricultural cooperative society, 13 small and marginal farmers of Badbar village in Barnala district have been struggling hard for the last six months to prove their existence and avail the benefit under Punjab government\u2019s debt relief scheme. Out of these 13 farmers, three held a protest outside the society office on Thursday, demanding justice. During these six months, these farmers have provided all the relevant documents, including Aadhaar cards, to prove themselves as alive but have still failed to convince the cooperative society to change their status from \u2018dead\u2019 to \u2018alive\u2019. Meanwhile, the officials claim that the farmers had initially failed to provide their Aadhaar cards and were to be put in the category of \u2018not available\u2019 but mistakenly got clubbed in the category of \u2018dead\u2019 by the cooperative society. Interestingly, this group of 13 includes Gurmukh Singh, who had prevailed upon a score of villagers to fill forms for getting compensation. Speaking to TOI, Gurmukh said, \u201cWhen the debt waiver process began in the village, I had filled forms of many farmers. Nearly six months ago, the cooperative society officials told me that my name had mistakenly been entered in the list of \u2018dead\u2019 and told to submit documents to prove that I was still alive. I deposited the relevant documents and was told that my name has been deleted from the list of \u2018dead\u2019. Now, about a week back, the cooperative society officials again called me, saying my name continues in the list of \u2018dead\u2019 and asked for documents again.\u201d \u201cI know that there are 12 others persons from my village who have also been shown as \u2018dead\u2019 and denied the debt waiver benefit. I have even approached the SDM in Barnala and requested him to instruct the cooperative department to set the record straight so that we (13) may also get the government assistance. But nothing has been done so far. I own 4 acres of land and am eligible for waiver of Rs 46,826,\u2019\u2019 he said. Another aggrieved farmer Jarnail Singh, who also owns 4 acre land and is eligible to get waiver of Rs 52,544, claimed, \u201cI provided all the documents to prove I was alive. Besides, everyone in the village cooperative society is well aware that I am not dead. I keep meeting them; yet remain in the category of \u2018dead\u2019. I am still struggling to get my status changed.\u201d Another marginal farmer Sukhwant Singh, who owns a oneacre landholding and is eligible for Rs 29,070 waiver, said, \u201cFor me, even this (Rs 29,070) amount means a lot as there is hardly any earning from the land and I am not in a position to repay the loan.\u201d Cooperative society secretary Jeet Singh said they had received a list from the assistant registrar\u2019s office nearly six months ago and it showed over 30 people as dead, when they were actually alive. \u201cAt a camp held at Kotduna village near here, I had informed the officials about the error and had provided the Aadhaar cards of these 30 people. I had even uploaded the Aadhaar cards on the official portal. After some time, the status of 17 beneficiaries changed, but 13 remained as \u2018dead\u2019 and they remain so despite me providing the Aadhaar cards again. Only a week ago, we got the list again \u2014 showing them as \u2018dead\u2019,\u201d he said. Barnala SDM Sandeep Kumar, when contacted, said, \u201cWe are trying to ascertain whose fault it is.

The commission proposed to dispose four complaints through a single order, as the issues involved therein, except minor variations, were the same. In all the four complaints, prayer had been made to give directions to the builder to refund the deposited amount, along with interest, compensation etc. At the time of arguments, on April 29, it was agreed by the contesting parties that the four complaints can be disposed of by passing a consolidated order. According to the commission, the complainants had purchased flats in a project launched by the builder, called KSB Greens in Gazipur Road, Zirakpur, Punjab. However despite making payment, the builder failed to deliver possession of the unit, which otherwise was supposed to have been handed over on or before December 2015. The builder stated that the buyers purchased the flats for future gain, as such, the complainants being investors, would not fall within the definition of consumer, as defined under Section 2 (1) (d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. But the forum held that it is not in dispute that the complainants purchased the flats in the aforesaid project of the builders. It was also not disputed that by the time these complaints were filed, possession of the units was not offered to the complainants, which otherwise was to be handed over on or before December 2015, as stipulated in Clause 10 of the Agreement to Sell. The forum further added that it is a simple case of non-delivery of possession of the unit by the committed date, despite receiving substantial amount from the complainants. The builder was then directed to pay up to all four complainants.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Minister of state for public health engineering Banwari Lal was also present in the meeting. The chief minister said that at present 126 villages with over 10,000 people were being covered under the Mahagram Yojana.

According to the suspension orders, Chadha has to report daily at the medical officer health office in Sector 17 and not leave without prior permission. Meanwhile, MC\u2019s initiative to start door-to-door garbage collection at source was only implemented in four UT villages. The MC is yet to finalize terms and conditions with collectors for starting the drive in urban areas too. The civic body had decided to segregate garbage at the source itself as the Supreme Court had issued directions to implement the Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2016. Besides, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) is also monitoring solid waste management cases. Last year, the garbage collection and segregation were majorly hit after the strike. The segregation of waste into wet, dry and hazardous is mandatory at household level under the Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2016, recently adopted by the Chandigarh administration. The bone of contention between the MC and garbage collectors was control over income after segregation of waste. While the MC is ready to provide jobs to private collectors on DC rates, along with benefits of provident fund and ESI, there is no consensus between both the parties over how the income after segregation will be distributed. But recently, the garbage collectors had agreed to help the civic body in segregation. The other modalities of memorandum of understanding between the MC and the collectors will be finalized by a panel formed by the MC commissioner.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

When the driver handed over him the original documents, Bhupinder took them away . Chand alleged the accused demanded Rs 25,000 for releasing the original documents . The deal was finally settled at Rs 20,000. Chand, in the meantime, lodged a complainant with the CBI.

The delegation had reached Shillong on Wednesday, after a radical outfit, Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC), recently threatened the Sikh settlers in Punjabi Lane area. The delegation also requested the committee formed by the Meghalaya government to take into account the genuine concerns of Sikh families before reaching any conclusion.

Taking up the issue of notices issued by Shillong municipal board to Sikh settlers to prove ownership of their land, the delegation urged Sangma to remove any apprehension from the minds of the community. It said that any arbitrary action of evacuation would be in gross violation of the right to movement and freedom of the Sikh community.

Professor Rajivlochan, former director of Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) at PU, said the \"academic reputation\", one of the components carrying maximum (40%) weightage in deciding QS ranking, was subjective. \"The evaluation is not transparent. We do not know who all are being interviewed by the QS in chalking out our academic reputation score,\" he said while maintaining that Panjab University not diversifying in research and not investing in outreach was equally responsible in the rank drop. From 701+ rank in 2017, the university has dropped out from the global top 1000 university list for the second time this year. PU's present IQAC director professor Ashish Jain said they were happy at another rankings that were also released on Wednesday. \"In the NTU rankings, we have outperformed all Indian universities. NTU rankings are significant for us because it compares the scientific performance of world universities based entirely on academic publications from three perspectives: research productivity, research impact and research excellence. QS rankings on the other hand does not give enough weightage to research and citations. Also, there were other factors that were not in our control,\" he said. Former vice-chancellor of PU professor Arun Kumar Grover said Indian universities always performed bad in QS rankings. \"Except for IITs and IISc, which are institutions and not universities, QS rankings have not been good for any Indian university as such. PU used to be in top 1000 but it was ranked low there in the list as well. The type of evaluation QS does is not really suitable for Indian universities,\" he said. The officials said the real test of the university would be two years later in NAAC rankings, wherein their own students and faculty members would be asked to assess the university on various factors. \"Right now, we don't know who is assessing us and how. But in NAAC rankings, if we score poor, we will at least know that we are not doing things right for our own students and faculty.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

In his complaint Dr Virendra Singh, a resident of sector 21, had stated that on September 6, 2018, he reached New Delhi at about 3.50am to board a flight to Chandigarh that was to depart at 5:55am. He checked in his luggage and was issued a boarding pass. He and other passengers were seated in the flight, but the said flight never took off and he was made to wait for several hours in the aeroplane and on enquiry, no satisfactory answer was given to him and other passengers by the crew members. Being mentally tortured for around one and half hours, the passengers were told to get off the aeroplane without assigning any reason. After waiting for about one hour at the airport, the staff/employee told them that the departure time of the flight had been revised and new boarding passes would be issued to them. However, no exact time of departure was conveyed. After collecting the earlier boarding passes, new boarding passes were issued whereby boarding time was changed to 8 am. However, the flight again got delayed contrary and the passengers were again made to wait for a couple of hours.

In its reply the airline stated that the first flight was cancelled due to technical reasons as the aircraft had developed technical snag and required immediate check up before flying. It added that technical experts tried their best to get it fixed up but could not and it took more than two hours and even more to get it rectified but the same was not sort out and as such the flight was cancelled and all the passengers were requested to re-board the aircraft and wait in the lounge area till further orders. It has further been pleaded that another flight, which the complainant later boarded, also did not take off as the same had just arrived from other destination and was not thoroughly checked up as the aircraft was not ready to fly because of refilling of gas that required two hours and for other technical checkups before take off. It was further pleaded that there was no other aircraft available with the airline as all flights were scheduled to fly at their destinations and as such the complainant was asked if he could share the taxi with others till Chandigarh, which he refused, therefore, his luggage was returned and he chose to come back to Chandigarh by Jet Airways flight. The forum, after hearing both sides, stated that no report regarding any technical defects/snags in the aircraft has been placed on record. Mere mentioning that the flights were cancelled due to technical snags could not be considered sufficient explanation to exempt the airlines from its liability. It was then directed to pay up.

Weekly once - or twice - these mandis make it possible for the residents of various sectors and colonies to get fresh veggies and fruits at reasonable prices, from, say about 12 noon, to sometimes till midnight. But the fallout of this is that the sellers tend to dump a whole lot of leftovers, when they call it a day. The residents of the locality end up dealing with the resulting consequences of these. Usually, they take in their stride a few disadvantages, given the benefits that they enjoy. But sometimes, like in the case of Sector 71 sabzi mandi, the consequences overweigh the benefits, leaving behind disgruntled residents. Now, it is here that the municipal corporation (MC) should butt in and ensure that public hygiene and safety are not compromised. But when they turn a deaf ear, the situation explodes sooner or later. Like it has happened in Sector 71. On the one hand, the sabzi mandi here is quite popular and are held twice a week - Tuesdays and Saturdays - drawing in quite a crowd. On the other hand, its popularity has become detrimental to the locals living here. They complain that over time the green waste left behind by buyers have accumulated into a mass and has started to stink unbearably. The problem has exacerbated because people from nearby areas have taken to dumping their everyday garbage here. Residents say trollies, tractors and redis come full with garbage and dump them here. Despite repeated pleas to the MC, there is no one to keep a check on this. Naturally, the overflowing garbage has become a constant source of supply for foraging stray animals, especially the cattle, who mill around the area, making it dangerous to commuters. The irony now is that locals are beginning to stay away from the mandis, as they feel buying veggies from there might compromise their health. Says Colonel Nirmal Singh, a resident of Sector 71: \"It's been more than 18 months since I last visited the mandi. Way too much dirty for me.\" Lt Col SS Sohi (retd), another resident of Sector 71, says he sent a petition to the commissioner and the MC on February 25 regarding this. But he received no response from them. He sent the petition again on June 10 and is now waiting for some concrete action by the MC. His petition, he says, does not just complain but also lists out actions that can be taken. He has even computed the cost of each solution that he has suggested. The million dollar question is: Will the MC take action before it is too late?

The state government\u2019s contribution to this scheme is in the form of land and the Centre contributes an equivalent equity, which is the cost of land.

The issue was raised by the state government by placing on record Amarinder\u2019s speech during the June 15 meeting of the governing council of Niti Aayog. The state government has informed the Union government that the state with just 1.5% of country\u2019s total land has more than 80% area under cultivation and allied agricultural activities. Therefore, accumulating contiguous land parcels of 10 sq.km is difficult. It has also urged the central government to consider raising the upper ceiling of its assistance for setting up of common facility centres for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) from Rs 15 crore to Rs 25 crore. Punjab is implementing the MSMEs cluster development programme of the Union government to create common infrastructure for enhancing productivity and capacity building.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party.

The Congress leader hit out at BJP's strategy of playing the nationalist card. \"We are Congress\u2026 we launched the freedom movement\u2026 gave our blood and sweat\u2026 braved British atrocities \u2026 we don't need any certificate to prove our nationalist feelings especially from the ones who apologised to the British at that time\", asserted Priyanka, urging the workers to go to every household in their area and meet every voter. She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022. And once we come, we will stay here for long on the basis of our hard work,\" she said adding that the hard-workers would be adequately rewarded.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.
