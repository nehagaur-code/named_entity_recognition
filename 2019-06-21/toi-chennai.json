Recently, a single judge of the court observed that the more hype was created over the Nadigar Sangam election than the elections to Parliament and state legislative assemblies. On June 19, the registrar of societies passed an order deferring election to the association in view of allegations including irregularities on the voters list. Challenging the order, associations counsel Krishna made an urgent mention before Justice P D Audikesavalu on Thursday morning. He wanted the court to set aside the registrar\u2019s order and permit the elections as scheduled on June 23. Refusing any urgent hearing, the judge said that the court would take up the case on Friday if a formal petition is filed.

Higher education minister K P Anbalagan released the engineering rank list on Thursday. Though 1,33,116 students had applied to the counselling, only 1,04,406 attended the certificate verification, of which 1,03,150 candidates were found eligible for counselling. Aravind G from Chennai, who scored 200 out of 200 marks secured the first rank, while Harishprabu S P from Harur, who also got 200 out of 200, got the second rank. Of the top 10 students, only seven students are from the state board, two are from CBSE schools and one student from other state board.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

The state is set to sign MoUs for fresh investments of more than Rs 3,500 crore in these sectors in the next few weeks. The bulk of new investments is in establishment of free trade warehousing zones (FTWZs) near Chennai. With China hit by US tariffs, manufacturing companies are looking at Vietnam and India for setting up new manufacturing units. \u201cGiven TN\u2019s strong presence as a manufacturing hub, the state is poised to attract more such investments, since India also has an added advantage of a large domestic market,\u201d sources in the state government told TOI. While Venkatesh COKE will establish an FTWZ at an investment of around Rs 1,500 crore, DP World put up Rs 1,000 crore for its FTWZ. While MM Forgings is scouting for a suitable location for investing around Rs 500 crore for making auto components, another company, Shreevari Energy Systems, will invest close to Rs 250 crore in a wind turbine manufacturing facility at Tuticorin. On the textiles and apparels front, PKPN group of mills and Ambika Cotton Mills are investing more than Rs 550 crore for their new facilities in Namakkal and Dindigul respectively. Following the Tamil Nadu government\u2019s sector- and country-specific focus for creating zones to attract fresh investments, Japan is fast emerging as a key source of new investments. While One Hub Chennai, a next generation industrial township jointly developed by Ascendas-Ireo beyond Tiruporur, has already become a hub for Japanese companies, a new industrial park, Origins, promoted by Sumitomo-Mahindra in north Chennai is set to become the second cluster for Japanese investments. Japanese conglomerate Yanmar, a leading global manufacturer of diesel engines for a wide variety of sectors including agriculture, is already setting up an engine plant for Rs500 crore at Origins. \u201cAnother Japanese company, Nissei Electric, will soon come on board with an initial investment of Rs80 crore for electrical parts manufacturing,\u201d sources said. Realizing the potential that Japan holds for new investments into Tamil Nadu, the state government too has gone out of its way. While only state-owned Sipcot developed industrial parks hitherto enjoyed 50% stamp duty exemption, for the first time Sumitomo-Mahindra\u2019s Origins was accorded that exemption. \u201cWith Tamil Nadu Business Facilitation Act and single window clearance in place, the state has become very proactive in attracting investments,\u201d a state government official said.

Barring a few like the Varadarajaswamy temple in Kancheepuram and Thyagaraja Swamy temple in Tiruvottiyur, very few of the 2,359 temples under the HR&CE have water. The tanks remain a rejuvenating source for urban areas. \u201cRequests have been made to see that drains are kept free of silt and debris so that inflow into the tanks can be maximized during the monsoon. Also, sewage outfalls into drains need to be plugged to ensure that only clean water enters the tanks,\u201d said an official source. The department renovated 847 of the 1,068 tanks identified for repairs in nine years. The urgency also stems from the water deficiency that has rocked several temples. The managers of temples like Kapaleeswarar in Mylapore, Jambukeshwarar Akilandeswari at Thiruvanaikaval in Trichy, Anbil Sri Brahmabureshwarar Temple in Trichy, and Arulmigu Meenakshisundreswarar temple and its 22-sub-temples, however, are reporting to higher officials that sufficient water is available to perform abishekams, sources said. While missing drain network to the temples is a concern, maintenance of existing links to collect rainwater is a top priority now. Last year, HR&CE had renovated 12 tanks by desilting, clearing encroachments, and facilities for inflow of rainwater and overflow channels for surplus water. S Rangarajan, Temple Exnora founding member, said the stormwater drain network to tanks such as Chennakesava Perumal Temple and Kandasamy Temple in Broadway, and Balasubramanya Swamy Temple in Teynampet needs immediate attention given the population in the vicinity and sewage outfall. \u201cLetting sewage into stormwater drains should be made an offence.

However, reports say that there were around 100 such cases across major airports last year. In a bid to prevent visitors from entering terminals, CISF personnel checks tickets and ID card of passengers before allowing them inside for check-in. However, there is no way for the CISF constable to find out if the ticket shown is genuine. And bags of passengers are not scanned at the gate. This means that the absence of a barcode scanner at the gate could lead to serious security risks, say senior officials. The exercise is also leading to congestion and queues during peak hours at the gates.

The committee, comprising senior officials from Chennai Port Trust, NHAI and state highways, will study if the project should be taken up under build-operate-transfer (BOT) or should be funded by the NHAI itself. \u201cThe committee members have met twice to discuss the funding pattern and related issues. They are yet to arrive on a decision,\u201d said an official from the NHAI. Initially, the state government and Chennai Port Trust had agreed to share the project cost of Rs1,800 crore. The project, which began in September 2010, was aimed to ease the city traffic and enable free movement of freight to the port. After the AIADMK was voted to power in 2011, then CM J Jayalalithaa opposed the project, stating that it would have an adverse impact on the environment and could also result in flooding of residential areas on either side of the river during monsoons. The government had also defended its decision stating that 14km \u2014 of the 18.3 km of the elevated expressway \u2014 run above Coovum river. The pillars were erected on the river. The NHAI resumed the project after the government signed the state support agreement (SSA) for the project in December 2016. The authorities have also completed the detailed project report (DPR) and estimated that the project would be taken up at Rs2,600 crore. There is no deviation from the alignment of the project. \u201cWe need to acquire around 14,000sq.m of defence land near Napier Bridge for the road project which Chennai Port Trust has assured,\u201d said the official. Experts, along with consultants, examined the 5km-long twin pillars constructed over Coovum river in Chetpet and Koyambedu seven years ago. \u201cPillars are in good condition. The pillars are good enough to withstand for 100 years,\u201d said the official. The NHAI is also preparing a DPR to extend the elevated expressway up to 10km from Maduravoyal to Ponnamallee to ensure free movement of freight to the port, said another official.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

While the state government will contribute Rs 50 crore, the remaining Rs 450 crore will be raised from the market. Funds will be used for incubation and start-up stage biotech projects. The move comes against the backdrop of the state-promoted TICEL Biotech Park II registering 100% occupancy a couple of months ago. Tamil Nadu\u2019s third biotech park is slated to open by January next year in Coimbatore. \u201cTamil Nadu Infrastructure Fund Management Corporation (TNIFMC) is a specialized body created for raising private equity from both India and abroad. Now, more money is coming from the Gulf nations. We will vest the task of raising and managing the fund with TNIFMC, which is a $1 billion category \u2013 1 AIF, registered under SEBI regulations. It is already handling a fund for TNEB\u2019s hydroelectric thrust projects,\u201d a state government official told TOI. \u201cOur focus will be to first get the Rs 50 crore contribution from the government to kickstart the whole exercise. TNIFMC will then initiate the process to raise the rest in private equity from high networth individuals (HNIs). We are expecting to raise the entire fund between December, 2019 and March, 2020. But, we need not wait till the entire money is raised. We will start identifying projects for incubation and startups for nurturing once the agency raises Rs 100 crore, to take the desired focus forward at the earliest,\u201d the official added. The need for a biotech-focused fund arose following the success of biotech parks promoted by state-owned Tidco, along with Tidel Park Ltd and other financial institutions. While the first biotech park \u2013 TICEL - was promoted in Chennai, in collaboration with Cornell University, USA, with a built up area of 1.45 lakh sqft at a cost of Rs 54 crore, the 100% occupancy of it enthused the promoters to come out with the second such park, with a built up area of 6.5 lakh sqft and at a cost of Rs 168 crore. The second TICEL park too reached 100% occupancy this year.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

His family told doctors that the teen had been complaining of pain for a long time. \"He was not given proper treatment. Whenever he complained of pain, he was taken to a quack or given over-the-counter pills,\" said the hospital's medical officer S Nandhini.

After he was brought here, his condition worsened and he did not respond to treatment. We could not ascertain the cause of his death,\" she said. Police have given an inquest for a postmortem after speaking to Hariharan's father, Sivakumar, and other family members. A relative of the teenager told TOI, \"He complained of pain. But after we gave him the tablet, he said the pain subsided. Later, at night he told the pain became unbearable. We rushed him to the hospital.\" \"His pain increased by the hour. We urged the duty doctor to refer him to a bigger hospital, but the duty doctor said it wasn't required,\" he said. At 2am, Hariharan vomited blood and collapsed inside the hospital's restroom. Doctors declared him dead a few minutes later. Following this his relatives staged a demonstration alleging negligence on the hospital's part. Hariharan is survived by his parents Sivakumar, Perarasi and brother Vignesh, 12. Arani police officials registered a case. Further investigations are on.

The revenue administration has given instructions to the district collectors to appoint the retired officials on a temporary basis for a consolidated pay of Rs 15,000 a month in the coming days. The VAOs, the heads of the revenue administration of one to three villages, are vested with powers to collect tax, certify for government welfare schemes, maintain law and order and extend assistance to farmers from crop insurance to assessment. While the sanctioned strength of the VAOs for the entire state is 12,616, at least 2,896 posts have now fallen vacant. The government decided to fill these posts after a recommendation from the commissionerate of revenue administration that \u201cwell experienced hands\u201d preferably retired VAOs who have considerable knowledge of the duties and responsibilities would be appropriate. It is left to the discretion of the district collectors to make the appointments, keeping in mind recruitments by TNPSC, appointments on compassionate grounds or promotions of village assistants to VAO posts. The retired officials will get salaries for a period of one year or till the necessity ceases. \u201cVacancies arise due to highly-qualified personnel moving to other jobs or superannuation. As a result, the serving VAOs are burdened with work and are accused of not making their presence felt in a village,\u201d revenue minister R B Udayakumar said, justifying the appointment of retired personnel. While the public service commission is informed about the vacancies periodically, the recruitment agency had delayed holding exams, the minister said. There was a thinking in the government to have one recruitment board for revenue services on the lines of Teachers Recruitment Board and Medical Services Recruitment Board. But, it was dropped. The move to appoint retired VAOs, however, evoked strong criticism from serving officers with representations being sent to the government opposing it. \u201cThough the government justifies its move to appoint the retired personnel on a temporary basis, it is condemnable,\u201d said TN Village Administrative Officers Munnetra Sangam president G Suresh. In 2008 too, there were more than 5,000 vacancies and the serving officers managed the show, he said. Tamil Nadu Government Employees Association president A Selvam said it was a known secret that the departments like treasuries, health and rural development temporary appoint retired officers. \u201cBut this move to appoint 1,000 retired personnel is unprecedented.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The party, however, went unrepresented at a meeting convened by the Centre to discuss the issue in Delhi on Wednesday. Sources said AIADMK representatives, law minister C Ve Shanmugam and Rajya Sabha floor leader A Navaneethakrishnan, could not participate after the organizers pointed out to them that the invite was meant only for party chiefs. The party later sent a note detailing its stand on the issue. The main opposition, DMK, which has opposed the \u2018one nation, one election\u2019 concept, skipped the meeting altogether. In its written submission, the AIADMK is believed to have recalled former chief minister J Jayalalithaa\u2019s stand that had been conveyed to a Parliamentary standing committee on personnel, public grievances, law and justice in 2015, just months before the last assembly elections in 2016. \u201cThere are several key issues which will have to be resolved before the model is adopted since it has wide ramifications. The party\u2019s stand is that the Lok Sabha and state assemblies should be given a fixed term first. Fixed dates of election and counting should also be announced as in the case of the Presidential election in the United States,\u201d said a senior leader, seeking anonymity. This would mean the dates would not be left to the whims of the Election Commission, that \u201csuddenly calls for a press meet and announces election schedule\u201d. The party is said to have insisted that a draft policy, that would include issues like the tenure of assemblies and Parliament, should be placed in public domain and discussed threadbare with the stakeholders. Jayalalithaa had demanded that norms should be worked out on the terms of the assemblies \u2013 either extended or cut short, as the residual period of the existing assemblies, especially that of Tamil Nadu, were not coterminous with the Lok Sabha. As the current term of the AIADMK government ends in 2021, the party is keen on completing its full term without any \u201chindrances\u201d whatsoever after registering a historic consecutive win in 2016 under Jayalalithaa. After failing to take part in the Delhi meeting, Shanmugam returned to Chennai in the evening. The AIADMK is of the view that a consensus must be arrived at ahead of any policy, given the contentious provisions in the Constitution to dissolve the assemblies and Parliament. The early dissolution will stand in the way of the conduct of simultaneous elections. \u201cA thorough discussion is required. While LS polls ended just now, there are several states that have got two, three and four years to complete. A lot of questions remain unanswered,\u201d said senior minister D Jayakumar. At a consultative meeting of the Law Commission in July last year, the party represented by former LS deputy speaker M Thambi Durai said it had no objections to simultaneous polls from 2024, if necessary.

Room rents in some of Chennai\u2019s hospitals had increased by up to Rs 350 a day in mid-May itself, and that was a month ago. Most big corporate hospitals claim that they have been able to absorb the cost, but only for now. On an average, a hospital with 30 beds is spending Rs 12,000 to Rs 15,000 more a day. \u201cThat would mean up to Rs 4.5 lakh a month. It is impossible for small hospitals to absorb that.

That could mean big hospitals, too, may not be able to sustain without price hikes.

The 200-bed Voluntary Health Services in Taramani, a Chennai suburb, said its monthly water bill has shot up by Rs 2 lakh.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The Congress leader hit out at BJP's strategy of playing the nationalist card. \"We are Congress\u2026 we launched the freedom movement\u2026 gave our blood and sweat\u2026 braved British atrocities \u2026 we don't need any certificate to prove our nationalist feelings especially from the ones who apologised to the British at that time\", asserted Priyanka, urging the workers to go to every household in their area and meet every voter. She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022. And once we come, we will stay here for long on the basis of our hard work,\" she said adding that the hard-workers would be adequately rewarded.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

It plans to hold a meeting for association members in which they would be asked to share the best practices to segregate and compost waste. \u201cMany residents are taking up initiatives to compost waste and set up terrace gardens. Some have zero-waste homes. We will ask them to send their entries and the best ones will be recognised and awarded. This is like an incentive such that others can follow these residents and ensure that waste is composted,\u201d said deputy commissioner P Madhusudhan Reddy. Reddy said the corporation was yet to finalise details of the competition. \u201cWe will meet associations and finalise the various categories. The competition will be launched soon. We want to make it participative and involve more residents,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are more than 6,000 bulk waste generators in the city and 10% of them are managing waste On their own campuses. We want to encourage those doing it and promote similar initiatives among other residents,\u201d Corporation commissioner G Prakash said. The civic body has stopped sending 700 metric tonnes of waste to its landfill as it has decentralised waste management through micro-composting centres and mulch pits in parks. Last week, it met hotel associations to ensure that waste from hotels are not sent to landfills. \u201cThe hotel association has agreed to send its waste to micro-composting centres. They will also reduce plastic waste. We will provide them with a plot where they can compost food waste,\u201d said an official.

The motion came in the backdrop of disqualification action initiated against the three rebel AIADMK MLAs for siding with independent MLA and AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran. TN cabinet will meet on June 24 at 10.30am to clear new proposals. The assembly rules demand that the notice \u2013 served by opposition leader M K Stalin on May 28 \u2014 be taken up first in the list of business on the day of the meeting, immediately after the expiry of the fourteen days\u2019 notice. The party maintains that the notice is live, and no decision has been taken on its withdrawal given the lack of numbers, especially after its poor show in the bypoll seats. \u201cWe are not in a dilemma over pursuing the notice. As of now, the notice given by the party president holds good. He will reveal the party\u2019s stand on his return to the city on Saturday,\u201d said DMK organising secretary R S Bharathi. The DMK and its allies enjoy a strength of 108, including seven of Congress and one IUML, as against the ruling party\u2019s 123 in the 234-member House. While the DMK senior leaders remain tight-lipped about pursuing the notice in the wake of party chief\u2019s \u201cwait and watch\u201d policy, all eyes are now on the business advisory committee of the assembly that is scheduled to meet on June 24 to decide on the business transactions for the month-long session. It is a 17-member panel headed by the Speaker. Assembly sources said the DMK chief, who is a member of the committee and issued the no-confidence motion notice, could make known his inclination to withdraw or pursue the notice in the committee meeting itself. \u201cIf he says yes, the motion will be brought to the assembly for leave of house on the first day, which is July 1,\u201d said a source. The assembly will adjourn on June 28 after making obituary references on AIADMK MLA R Kanakaraj (Sulur) and DMK MLA K Rathamani (Vikravandi), and former MLAs. The month-long session will get to see sparks fly high, with the opposition gearing to corner the government on various issues including the severe drinking water crisis in the state, as well as suicide by students over NEET. The party has already announced state-wide protests on June 22 demanding measures on a war-footing to tackle water crisis, while blaming it as \u201cadministration failure\u201d that has left the state high and dry. In a statement, Stalin on Thursday also demanded that the AIADMK government move a special resolution to discuss drinking water crisis on the day one of the assembly session. The ruling party is bracing for the challenges after having gained adequate strength to run the show. \u201cEven if rebel MLAs stay away, and those who won on AIADMK symbol keep off, we will still have majority and be intact despite the poaching threat of the DMK. We are prepared,\u201d said a senior minister seeking anonymity. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, along with his deputy, O Panneerselvam, had a special district-wise session with all MLAs, ministers recently to maintain \u201cdecorum\u201d in the House.
