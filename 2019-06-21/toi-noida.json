Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Officials said the remediation of waste at the new site will begin within a month as just about 2,000 tonnes of waste is left to be recycled at the earlier site in Sector 54. The shift was necessitated after residents approached the National Green Tribunal, protesting the waste plant near residential areas of Sector 54. The NGT had in February last year asked the Authority to look for an alternative site and Mubarakpur was chosen as it does not have human habitation around it. Most of the waste at Sector 54 has already been recycled and the 2,000 tonnes that are left will be treated in a week, officials said. Of late, the Authority has been dumping waste at Mubarakpur, where around 1 lakh tonnes of garbage has accumulated. The transfer of equipment to treat waste from Sector 54 to Mubarakpur has already begun. \u201cAround 95,000 tonnes of waste has already been recycled in Sector 54. We are almost through with the work there and the shifting of equipment has begun,\u201d said Alok Tandon, chief executive officer at Noida Authority. Most of the refuse derived fuel produced after remediation in Sector 54 has been sent to cement factories to be used as raw material. The leftover inert waste is being used to cover the area where waste was dumped earlier. \u201cWe also got a small portion of compost after the remediation. However, it wasn\u2019t found to be very useful for plants. Therefore, we are just using it to fill the empty space now,\u201d said SC Mishra, deputy general manager (public health). The Authority had employed a contractor to set up the plant for 1.5 lakh tonnes of garbage in Sector 54 and Mubarakpur. The contractor still has to remediate about 55,000 tonnes of waste. Once the contract is over, the Authority will float a tender for a new agency that will take care of the waste treatment. \u201cSince the existing contract for remediation of 1.5 lakh tonnes of waste is getting over, we will be opening it for application again. If the process takes time, we may extend the existing contract for a brief period,\u201d Tandon said. Residents who moved NGT described the shift as a \u201cgreat victory\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a great victory for us. It shows that if residents come together, the biggest of battles can be won,\" said K Arunachalam, a resident of Sector 22 (one of the RWAs that approached NGT) Activists sounded an alert. \u201cThere is no human habitation very close to Mubarakpur area, but if untreated waste is used in the landfill, it can contaminate groundwater and affect our health,\" said Vikrant Tongad, an environmental activist.

The Authority had earlier asked all RWAs, malls, hospitals, hotels and industries to start segregation at source. It had also ordered that after June 30, only dry segregated waste will be picked up from residential areas. The RWAs are expected to use composting machines to manage wet waste internally. While residents claimed that it was difficult to start segregation immediately, officials said they were hopeful of meeting the deadline. \u201cWe have been speaking to RWAs regarding waste segregation and I have personally met members of over 20 RWAs.

Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

Previously, the Authority had attempted to get the site cleared at least three times but their efforts remained unsuccessful owing to the protests. The Noida Authority said a few houses and a marble market have illegally come up on the green belt. \u201cThere are several small patches of land that are part of the Noida Authority\u2019s green belt and park area along the DSC road in Barola. These have been illegally encroached upon by the marble market. It has to be cleared sooner or later,\u201d said MP Singh, officer on special duty, Noida Authority. After the villagers gathered, extra police force and the city magistrate was called in to settle the matter. The Noida Authority team returned on Tuesday without taking any action. The officials said paperwork is being checked. Residents of Barola village, who have been protesting the drive since Sunday, said the land was acquired and later given back to them. However, the Noida Authority still comes back for demolition after misdirecting the National Green Tribunal, they alleged. \u201cThe Authority had acquired our land in 1976 but it was later notified in our names following years of protest. Most people had not taken any compensation for their previously acquired land. However, in 2017, the authority and residents of Sector 48 approached the NGT stating that the marble market is built over the green belt,\u201d said Shubhash Chauhan from Barola . After the NGT ordered the demolition, the villagers said the Authority had deliberately not mentioned that the land was given back to the villagers. \u201cThe NGT had asked the Noida Authority to handle the matter. They have not responded to our queries regarding the matter. There are over 200 families living here and we cannot just let them demolish our homes and take away our land illegally,\u201d said Prem Singh Bhati, another Barola resident.

Officials said that this is a test project to check feasibility. \u201cThis is just a pilot (project). It is initially being tested if the water flow and the technique are feasible or not. It will soon be installed in offices, public toilets and other areas as well,\u201d said Rajeev Tyagi, general manager, Noida Authority. According to private companies that are offering this nozzle, it reduces the size of the water droplets so that is just enough for washing hands, vegetables and fruits. This can reduce water usage by up to 95%, the firms say. However, if greater water flow is required, the nozzle can be turned accordingly for more force. The size of the water droplets, however, remains small, and usage with this is reduced by up to 80%. \u201cIt is a one-time investment that can be a huge leap towards water conservation. People can start using these at home as well. It is a technique already being used in many hotels and was suggested by a resident over WhatsApp,\u201d said Alok Tandon, chief executive officer, Noida Authority. The nozzle requires cleaning once every 45 days. Several designs of altered nozzles and tap filters are available online through e-commerce websites.

The new bridge will come as a relief for thousands of commuters who travel between Delhi and Noida. Officials said the widening work had been done by the Delhi Flood Control Board at a cost of Rs 5.4 crore. Earlier, the road had two lanes, which has been widened to four. Work on the project had started eight months ago. \u201cWe had been receiving a number of complaints from commuters as well as traffic police about the bottleneck on the road leading to Sector 15 roundabout from Noida gate. Earlier, this traffic jam would trail back to Sector 14 A, which caused a lot of problems to commuters. We are hopeful that with the construction of this 72-metre patch, the issue will be resolved,\u201d said Vijay Rawal, project engineer at the Noida Authority. He added that the bridge would be thrown open next week. Another boost to Noida-Delhi traffic was the opening of a roundabout before the Mahamaya flyover on Thursday. Constructed at a cost of about Rs 3 crore, work on the new roundabout had started in January. Abdul Kadir, site engineer of the project, told TOI that the cut had become prone to accidents because of traffic merging from three directions. \u201cTraffic coming from Greater Noida, Amity University and Kalindi Kunj were merging at this point while those who needed to go towards HCL would get puzzled,\u201d said Kadir, adding that with the construction of this new roundabout, the choke point would be decongested. Officials said the first bridge over the Shahdara drain was constructed near Sector 18 in 2017, while the second one was the Kalindi Kunj bridge that was inaugurated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath last year. The site engineer said construction work on the roundabout had not been fully completed yet as the Authority is also planning to construct two tripods at the curves to avoid congestion. \u201cTo fully implement the diversion plan, we will construct two tripods on the opposite curves of the roundabout \u2014 one on the expressway side and the other one on the Kalindi Kunj side. This will make the passage of the vehicles easier,\u201d said Kadir. He added that they had currently placed a few barriers to mark the boundaries of the tripod, and construction would begin after a 10-day trial.

The Aranya project was probably the first housing project in India to be deregistered under the new real estate law and taken over for completion by the regulatory authority in May. The project, which began in 2007, is valued over Rs 1,500 crore, and the total number of investors is around 1,400. According to UP-Rera member Balwinder Kumar, the step will help the regulatory authority to know exactly how many genuine buyers are invested in the project, so that a correct estimate can be drawn of the amount of money paid up to the builder and how much the investors still owe towards the completion of their flats. \u201cDuring preliminary investigation, we found multiple allocation of single flats. We have also found multiple flats \u2014 10 or 15 in a bunch booked under a single name. So obviously we are finding it difficult to get a true picture of the list of buyers. But a fresh registration of all buyers of the project would help us identify them,\u201d Kumar told TOI. Moreover, the regulator is in the process of getting a co-builder on board for the completion of the pending flats. \u201cWe have also asked a builder, chosen by the buyers to present their completion plan to UP-Rera on Wednesday. If we are not convinced, we may ask Noida Authority to select a builder for the same,\u201d he added. The UP-Rera had earlier asked the state government to constitute a special investigation team to look into the alleged misappropriation of Rs 147 crore by Unnati. The figure came to fore after a forensic audit by Curry & Brown. Moreover, an inspection team of Noida Authority earlier found that out of eight towers, only four are ready for completion and in four towers, major construction work is still pending. While Aranya phases 1 and 2 apartment buyers have completely paid up their money and the phases 3, 4 and 5 buyers have so far only paid up about 20% of the cost to the builder. UP-Rera officers earlier confirmed that the builder had left the country. The completion of the project has been initiated by UP-Rera by invoking Section 7 of the Rera Act, which makes provision for UP-Rera to step in and facilitate completion of abandoned projects.

Khanna is suspected to have expired nearly three days ago, but her body was found only when an employee working with a meter reading company informed police that the house was emitting foul smell. Amit Kumar, Sector 37 chowki in-charge said that a police response vehicle was sent to the spot around 11am on Monday. \u201cHer elder son is working in Dubai as a trader while her younger son is working in Bengaluru.

Rathore, who was suffering from high blood pressure and high sugar levels, told his attendant Ankit on Tuesday night that he felt uneasy. When Ankit checked his room later, he found that Rathore was not moving and informed police, said Sector 39 SHO Rajesh Sharma. Rathore is survived by three daughters, all based in the United States. While police said that Ankit was a full-time attendant, neighbours said he used to work part-time.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The protests came on a day the Gautam Budh Nagar district was felicitated by the UP government for collecting around Rs 14.8 crore in power revenue between October last year and this March, the highest in the state during the period. The district was followed by Ferozabad at Rs 9.6 crore and Mainpuri, which collected Rs 9.3 crore in the same period. GB Nagar\u2019s overall collection of power revenue for the financial year 2018-19 was also at an all-time high of Rs 103 crore, in comparison to Rs 64 crore collected in 2017-18. District magistrate BN Singh was felicitated with a gold certificate by chief secretary Anup Chandra Pandey for the highest revenue collection. \u201cCollection of revenue from power has been maximum at Rs 103 crore for the financial year 2018-19, as against Rs 64 crore in 2017-18. This award is in recognition of such steep collection,\u201d said Singh, the district magistrate. Residents, however, protested the plan to increase tariff and called for an upgrade in power infrastructure. \u201cWe welcome the felicitation of the district for collecting the highest revenue. But we are completely opposed to the proposed 20% hike in power tariff for the simple reason that we have been facing long outages of late in Noida and Greater Noida. There has been lack of upgraded infrastructure and accountability on the part of the power department in the district. Despite paying hefty bills, we are facing 4-8 hours of power cuts every day. How can a tariff hike be justified in a situation where the power department is unable to provide regular supply?\u201d asked NP Singh, president of the Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA). Apart from the 20% increase in power tariff across slabs, the UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) has also suggested a hike in the fixed charge from Rs 90 per KW to Rs 110. If implemented, this will lead to a steep increase in power bills \u2014 a monthly bill of, say, Rs 3,000 will rise to around Rs 4,000. In the tariff proposal submitted to UP Electricity Regulatory Commission, UPPCL has recommended the highest increase of 26% in the lowest slab of 0-150 units, raising it from Rs 4.90 per unit to Rs 6.20. The tariff for the 151-300 units slab is proposed to be hiked from Rs 5.40 to Rs 6.50 per unit. According to the RWA federation president, the hike is all the more unjustified in a district that pays the highest revenue and steep electricity bills. \u201cNoida is a \u2018no power cut zone\u2019, which is required for promotion of industry. It\u2019s also an area which provides the maximum revenue. Then, why should it be subjected to a tariff hike? We oppose the proposal and will take up the matter with chief minister Yogi Adityanath. We will approach Prime Minister Narendra Modi, if needed,\u201d said NP Singh. Greater Noida resident Alok Kumar suggested that the power department should instead focus on laying underground cables, upgrading old transformers, replacing rusting poles, panel boxes and increasing load capacities of substations. \u201cWe congratulate the district magistrate for the felicitation in revenue collection, but strongly oppose the hike in tariff,\u201d said Kumar. District magistrate Singh maintained that the hike was in the proposal stage. \u201cThe tariff hike proposal pertains to the power department. Residents should raise their concerns regarding tariff etc with them or the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Committee. It does not fall under my jurisdiction,\u201d said Singh, adding that he was only authorised for revenue collection.

A major survey is currently on to determine whether an underpass or a flyover can be constructed to ease traffic at the roundabout, officials said. The move comes after previous experiments failed to reduce congestion at the busy intersection and in the wake of the Greater Noida Authority approving the extension of the Aqua Line with a proposed station in Sector 123 at the Parthala Chowk. The metro extension project is expected to kick off later this year. \u201cParthala roundabout is a key junction in Noida. We are currently carrying out the survey. And once we get the report, we will take a call on whether an underpass or a flyover would be able to provide smooth connectivity from Ghaziabad to Noida and Greater Noida via the FNG corridor,\u201d KK Aggarwal, Authority\u2019s general manager, told TOI. \u201cThe decongestion project at the junction entails an investment of Rs 90 crore. We will spend the money once we finalise a structure on the basis of the feasibility survey report,\u201d he added. Experts also agree. Naveen Sharma of Medulla Soft Technologies that submitted a traffic feasibility report on the area to Noida Authority in March this year, said that while about 7,000 to 8,000 vehicles ply every hour in the area during day time, the number increases to about 18,000 during peak hours. \u201cWe had recommended reducing the circumference of the roundabout and other minor alterations. But in the long run, a graded separation by way of a flyover or an underpass is the eventual option for the intersection, especially since metro connectivity is planned in the area,\u201d he added. Residents of highrise apartments in the vicinity of Parthala Chowk say unclogging the roundabout is the need of the hour. \u201cCongestion at the busy intersection is increasing with each passing day. The Noida Authority must take a concrete step to ease traffic snarls at the roundabout once and for all,\u201d said Sanjeev Dixit, a resident of Sector 121. Currently, the Parthala Chowk connects many areas and is a main connecting point for Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. While it has traffic coming from Ghaziabad in the north side of the roundabout, its east side has the busy Kisan Chowk. The south of the roundabout caters to Surajpur area of Greater Noida, including the collectorate and the police headquarters, and its west side has traffic coming from Sector 71 and beyond, including the populated 7x sectors as well as the industrial sectors of 62 and 63.

Workers at the site said the two private contractors overseeing the construction had forced them to get into the ditch despite the soil being loose. Angoori (24), a construction worker, took along her three-year-old child, Monika, with her into the ditch as there was no one to look after her. Angoori, her husband Guddu (25) and Monika were all trapped under the soil along with two other labourers \u2014 Babulal (35) and Bari (55). The cave-in took place at the construction site of a private building in Knowledge Park area around 11.45am. An excavator had just dug a ditch to lay the foundation for the building when the two contractors \u2014 Lalit and Kapil Bhadana \u2014 asked six of their workers to get inside the 6ft ditch and level the walls manually. As both Angoori and Guddu were ordered to get inside, they could not have left Monika alone. \u201cMinutes before the accident, an earthmover had dug up the area. After this, the contractors asked a bunch of workers to get inside the ditch and level the walls. This seemed risky, but the contractors forced the workers,\u201d said Rajkumar, Angoori\u2019s brother. He said the workers had told the two contractors that the soil was loose, but they refused to budge. \u201cThere was a pile of debris that needed to be excavated, but the contractor, without realising the odds, forced the workers inside the ditch. The walls collapsed within minutes and fell on the workers. The adults survived, but Monika succumbed to her injuries. My sister and brother-in-law, too, suffered injuries in the head and chest,\u201d Rajkumar added. The victims were rushed to Sharda Hospital, where the child was declared dead on arrival, while others were admitted for treatment of injuries. The two contractors have been booked under sections 304A (causing death by negligence) on a complaint by Rajkumar. \u201cThe contractors \u2014 Lalit and Kapil Bhadana \u2014 fled the spot soon after the accident. Prima facie, the construction workers were not given any helmets before they were sent inside the drain. A probe has been initiated, and due action will be taken against those found guilty,\u201d said Arvind Pathak, the station house officer of Knowledge Park police station. Asked about the condition of the other workers, the officer said one of them, Bari, was being treated for critical injuries. \u201cMost of them have been discharged after first-aid. A woman named Bari is still in the ICU for critical head injuries,\u201d Pathak added.

But Ishika Singh, Anuj Shukla and Anshul Kaushik won\u2019t walk out of jail yet because they have been booked in two FIRs, only one of which the court has ruled on. The court of additional district and sessions judge Nalin Kant Tyagi on Wednesday heard arguments in the defamation case filed by police against the trio for the show on the CM. The judge granted bail after submission of two sureties of Rs 40,000 each. The other case, which relates to charges of forgery and cheating and was registered because Nation Live, the channel, was allegedly found not to have the requisite permits, was heard by fast track court judge Ved Prakash Verma. The order has been reserved. The court asked the three news channel staffers not to seek a postponement of hearing during statements of witnesses and ensure presence either in person or through their lawyers on the dates of hearing. According to Nitin Gupta and Parth Upadhayay, lawyers for Shukla and Kaushik, respectively, they argued in court there was nothing defamatory in the TV discussion that was aired on June 6 and the channel had, in fact, tried to expose a woman who has been making controversial claims about the CM and also whether she was part of any political conspiracy. The woman featured on the programme through a dial-in. \u201cWe contended before the court that while the FIR states that the channel\u2019s show was solely aimed at provoking members of a party, there were no riots even after two days of the discussion being aired as against what the police report anticipated. No complaint was lodged by any of the party members and despite allegations of defamation, the CM did not lodge an FIR but it was a policeman who did so,\u201d Gupta said, adding they had also apprised the judge that the arrested trio was not produced before a court even 48 hours after their detention. The arrests took place after the local administration put together a report that saw the possibility of a law and order problem as a result of the show being aired. The office of Nation Live in Sector 63 was sealed on the same weekend as the arrests of Shukla and Ishika (June 8/9). Kaushik was arrested the following week. The FIR relating to defamation was filed on the complaint of a sub-inspector. The other was based on an inquiry by the district information department\u2019s assistant director, Meena Biswas. The government counsel opposed bail, stating that the channel had aired a discussion on the CM, who is at a level where \u201ceven a small aspersion can spoil the situation of society\u201d, and that it was a \u201ccrime serious in nature\u201d. But the court said the discussion did not seem to cause enmity, hatred and disaffection in society. \u201cThe accused are in jail since June 9 (Ishika and Anuj) and June 11 (Anshul). Looking at the facts, there are sufficient grounds to grant bail without commenting on the merits/demerits of the case,\u201d reads the court order. The court noted that the lawyers had contended that the trio had been \u201cframed\u201d and \u201cthey had no ill-intention in airing the discussion\u201d. It also said the accused \u201cdo not have any criminal past\u201d.

His daughter Kavita was married to Vivek Kumar, a private firm employee, in 2011 and she had been staying at her in-laws\u2019 house in Salarpur village in Noida.

The committee, which recently surveyed Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Nodia, has dubbed the Hindon a \u201cdead river\u201d that has a dissolved oxygen level of almost zero. The team also visited 23 industries and government hospitals in Ghaziabad and noted that hardly any of them were adhering to environmental norms. In its report, the committee has said that \u201cup to 35-40% patients coming to these medical colleges and hospitals may be infected and they are prone to suffer from variety of diseases like cancer, asthma, collitis and other alike water and air-borne diseases\u201d. On pollution in the Hindon, the committee has said that government agencies have turned a blind eye on illegal colonies that have mushroomed around waterbodies. \u201cWe have issued directives to the administration of these three districts to initiate a demolition drive in the river catchment area,\u201d said Rajendera Singh, general secretary of the NGT committee. In Ghaziabad, the committee found that eight major drains \u2014 Jwala drain, Arthala drain, Kaila Bhatta drain, Indirapuram drain, Dasna drain, Pratap Vihar drain, Karheda drain and Hindon Vihar drain \u2014 were discharging untreated sewage in the Hindon. \u201cNo STP/ETP has been connected to treat the entire sewage, in consequence thereof, the entire city of Ghaziabad is polluting river Hindon with untreated sewage,\u201d the report said. The team also noted that industries were not adhering to environmental norms. \u201cOf the 20-plus industries we inspected, except for Honda industry, no other industry meets the environmental norms. Even those industries that have installed STP/ETP often bypass their effluents and discharge it directly into drains, which ultimately find their way into the Hindon river,\u201d said Singh, who added that a detailed report on the committee\u2019s findings is being prepared and will be released shortly. City-based environmentalist Sushil Raghav said that in July last year, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had carried out a survey to ascertain the level of groundwater and surface water contamination around the Hindon. \u201cGroundwater samples were analysed for parameters such as fluoride, sulphate, oil and grease and heavy metals. The report revealed that 93 of 168 groundwater sampling locations in Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur and Shamli are contaminated with one or more parameters and exceeded BIS drinking water specifications,\u201d said Raghav. \u201cWhat the committee is saying is nothing new, but despite such damning report and observations, no one is really interested in the river,\u201d he added. Hindon, also known as Harnadi, is a rain-fed river that originates from Saharanpur and flows through Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Baghpat and Ghaziabad before emptying into the Yamuna. Due to the high levels of pollution, Hindon has earned the status of \u201cdead river\u201d and its water declared \u201cunfit\u201d even for bathing.

The number of runways originally planned was four, for which PricewaterhouseCoopers carried out a survey, and the government had later sought another feasibility study to increase the number of runways to six.

An Indirapuram resident for the past seven years, the 38-year-old drives to Delhi, where his office is, every day. Yet last Friday, while returning from a late shift, he almost drove his car into a barricade on NH-9, a few hundred metres before the Noida Sector 62 crossing. It was dark and he saw the diversion late. There was no \u2018diversion ahead\u2019 warning. An Uber driver who does the Noida-Ghaziabad-Delhi circuit every day learnt the hard way that he could not trust his GPS on NH-9 like he does everywhere else. He likes the GPS because it gives him the shortest route. But recently, while taking passengers to Noida from Vaishali, the GPS pointed to an exit that brought him to a dead end. There was a mound of earth ahead. He said his passengers had warned him but he had insisted on following the map. Now, he just takes the advice because the highway is a maze. Changes are happening almost every day on NH-9, or Delhi-Meerut expressway, as the road gets widened and upgraded from UP Gate till the Dasna toll plaza and work picks up pace. The result is diversions, detours and closed turns, which are necessary because traffic cannot be stopped while the highway is being upgraded. But the complete absence of helping hands for traffic has drivers at a loss as to which way to turn. For instance, the original right turn into Noida from the highway, towards Labour Chowk, as one drives from Delhi is closed. A U-turn has been created a little further, but with no clear markers or personnel directing traffic, motorists have been left to figure it out on their own. It\u2019s the same for the new exits created on the Indirapuram side. The GPS can\u2019t keep pace with the changes, and unless one is familiar with the terrain, a motorist could easily miss an exit and end up taking a long detour, or worse, driving on the wrong side like many already do. This has led to the possibility of an accident shooting up. Regular commuters pointed out that when the Delhi portion of the highway \u2014 between Sarai Kale Khan and UP Gate \u2014 was being upgraded, similar diversions had to be made, but there were always a couple of traffic personnel posted at the diversions. This was very helpful, particularly at night, because traffic did not go stray. But as the construction machinery has moved into UP, the same standards are apparently not needed. Currently, between Kala Patthar in Indirapuram and Pratap Vihar, where the highway upgrade work is on in full swing, motorists have to negotiate about six diversions. The central verge is almost entirely dug up but not uniformly barricaded, so if motorists are not careful, they could slip into it. \u201cThe diversions are mostly marked with fluorescent strips, which during the daytime are useless and if you are not cautious enough, chances are there you might veer into the muddy track,\u201d said Abhishek Singh, a commuter. At night, there isn\u2019t enough light for these strips to glow, unless a strong headlight beam falls favourably on them. Mohan Mohanty, another commuter, points to another major problem caused by the lack of police oversight \u2014 autos and bikes diving between diversions and driving on the wrong side almost across the entire stretch, making driving difficult and often holding up traffic. \u201cAt Chajarsi cut, chances of a head-on collision are high,\u201d he says. The NHAI, which is in charge of the project, is aware of these problems but isn\u2019t promising any solutions, pointing out instead that work will be completed in four months. \u201cThis is a transition phase. We could possibly close down the stretch, nor could we stop work. Both have to go on simultaneously,\u201d said Mudit Mudgal, project engineer with NHAI. \u201cWe have done all we could do under the circumstances\u2026 at times, even workers are stationed at seemingly troublesome spots to manage traffic but it cannot be done at all times of the day.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Movies to watch on New Year's Eve": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/movies-to-watch-on-new-years-eve/photostory/67299074.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Caste more important than regn no?": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/castemoreimportantthanregnno3f/articleshow/65537320.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "\nSara Ali Khan promotes Kedarnath in Noida\n": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/sara-ali-khan-promotes-kedarnath-in-noida/articleshow/67000767.cms", "time": "", "description": "A day before the release of Kedarnath - her debut film - actor Sara Ali Khan visited DLF Mall of India to promote the film.

While the wetland saw two months of dry spell last year, this year\u2019s heat too has taken a toll on the marsh, with water levels reducing drastically. While the forest department has written to the irrigation department to release water through the Tilpata canal, its main source of water, the only hope for the wetland is the upcoming monsoon that may help reverse the habitat loss of birds to some extent, say officials. The 60-acre wetland within the 308-acre Surajpur forest area is hydrated by the Tilpata canal perennially and the monsoon rains, seasonally. \u201cWe have asked the irrigation department to release the water at the earliest so that the birds which are present do not lose their habitat,\u201d PK Srivastava, district forest officer of Gautam Budh Nagar, told TOI on Thursday. Last year, a similar situation had created an alarm among environmentalists and bird watchers. The water supply to the wetland through the Tilpata canal has been affected over the past two years since a concrete drain was created to divert the supply of Tilpata water into the wetland. The artificial construction has disrupted the flow of the water into the marsh. The wetland had completely dried up for during May and June in 2018. Surajpur was granted the status of a wetland by the National Green Tribunal in September, 2018. It is now protected under the Wetlands Protection Act of 2010. And according to bird watchers and environmentalists, it is important that the wetland remains adequately flooded so that fish and other water-borne food for birds like algae can survive. \u201cWe hope the wetland will be refilled soon, otherwise the hope now is for the monsoon rain when the water will definitely get recharged in the area,\u201d Srivastava said. While the migratory birds have left the marsh by the end of March, local resident birds are still present at the wetland. Surajpur wetland represents a vibrant habitat supporting diverse threatened flora and fauna. The wetland hosts 186 species of birds belonging to 44 families, of these 102 species are resident, 53 species are winter migrant and 28 species are summer migrants. The wetland supports birds like Asian Openbill Stork, White-necked Stork, Black-crowned Night Heron and Black-headed Ibis. The wetland also supports the breeding of some rare birds like Bristled Grassbird, Black-necked Stork and Sarus Crane in Delhi-NCR.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

A piece of the broken glass window was found near the spot,\u201d she said. Vaishvi said though the two CCTV cameras installed near the house were working, they were not put on recording mode. \u201cIt is very disturbing because the car was a keyless vehicle.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Unauthorised parking": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/unauthorisedparking/articleshow/65361137.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "RCB team 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rcb-team-2019-players-list-royal-challengers-bangalore-team-2019/articleshow/67151637.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Police and other authorities keeping a blind eye": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/police-amp-other/articleshow/63422927.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Shiv Sena List 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/shiv-sena-announces-21-lok-sabha-candidates-for-maharashtra/articleshow/68523309.cms", "time": "", "description": "MUMBAI: Shiv Sena has come up with it's first list of 21 candidates, out of 23 to contest in Lok Sabha polls in Maharashtra.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

According to the complaint filed by Shivendra Sharma, DGM (projects) of Saya Buildcon, the incident took place on June 11 on the 7th-floor flat of Tower I outside the flat of the Guptas. \u201cAround 11am, the maintenance department was informed that the fire alarm on the 7th floor had caught fire.
