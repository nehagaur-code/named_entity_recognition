The 13th century marvel, a major tourist attraction, was shut since May 3 after the cyclonic storm made landfall near Puri. A team of Archeological Survey of India (ASI) visited the temple on Friday and found that the cyclone had not caused any \"structural damage\" to the temple, said superintendent of ASI (Odisha circle) Arun Kumar Mallick. Tourist flow to Puri and Konark has been badly hit after the cyclone as basic facilities like power, drinking water, telecommunication, transport and ATM services are yet to be fully restored. \"It is almost 11 days and business in Puri is yet to be revived as tourist flow has gone down significantly after the cyclone. People are struggling for basic needs. The opening of Konark Temple may bring some change,\" said Badal Das, president of Konark Surakshya Samiti, a local organisation. On Tuesday, the government said restoration of power supply to consumers in Puri and Konark will start from May 15. \"It will take time to restore power supply in the entire district as the damage is huge. Over 5,000 skilled workers have been engaged 24x7 to restore power to over 29 lakh consumers,\" said information and public relations (I&PR) secretary Sanjay Singh. Meanwhile, a seven-bed dialysis unit started operating at the Puri district headquarters hospital from Monday. Altogether 35 patients have undergone dialysis in the last two days. Even as the state government targeted to normalise banking operations in all affected districts, including in Puri by Monday, official figures said only 79% banks are functional in Puri district while only 22% ATMs are operational. Banking services in other affected districts like Khurda, Cuttack, Kendrapada and Jagatsinghur is gradually becoming normal. On relief operations, Singh said initial cash assistance of Rs 2,000 has been given to 84% of eligible affected families in Puri district and over 90% persons received aid in Khurda, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapada, Cuttack and Bhubaneswar by Tuesday. Even though the state government claims to have restored power supply in Bhubaneswar by May 12 midnight, several areas in and around the city are reeling under darkness. People living in Baranga, Pahala, Nakhara, Naharkanta, Nuagoan and Chandaka are yet to get power.

From the time it was forecast that Fani may make landfall in Odisha, the government had decided to ensure zero casualty. We worked shoulder-to-shoulder with the civil administration to move the people from the predicted path of the cyclone. It was very difficult in some areas because they were reluctant to leave their homes. Our role was to persuade them to do so. Our men and women helped carry the elderly, the infirm and children to safety. Once they were moved to cyclone shelters, we provided them security there. What about police's duty after the cyclone? After the cyclone struck, we played a role in moving the injured to hospitals. We were in the community and the people's first point of contact with the government. We helped clear important roads, besides ensuring that communication lines were kept opened. The Reserve Police Line, where 250 families of police personnel live, was badly damaged but all the policemen reported to duty. We started a common kitchen for the affected families. Realising that others in the affected areas also needed cooked food, we opened four centres - Karuna camps - in Puri where cooked food is being served to the people. Fifteen more such centres will be opened this week at police stations. Police personnel from the unaffected districts have volunteered to help run the centres. There have been many incidents of people resorting to protests after delay in getting relief. How are you handling them? We cannot stop the people with grievances from resorting to democratic protests. On Sunday, two days after the cyclone made landfall, there were instances of people blocking roads between Puri and Bhubaneswar. We reached out to them and convinced them to end their agitation. Only the protest at Malatipatpur lasted for hours but the others were lifted within 30 minutes. There have been no major protests since then. Police parties are accompanying relief trucks to prevent any incident. Are the strong-rooms housing the EVMs intact? Thankfully, there has been no damage to the strongrooms. Only the boundary wall of a strong-room in Puri has collapsed. We have increased security there. During the cyclone, security personnel were guarding the strong-rooms while also ensuring their own safety. How are you managing the security of the strong-rooms without electricity? Are the CCTV cameras working? Security is fool proof. The CCTV cameras are being run by diesel generators. The central armed police forces make up the inner ring of security. In Puri, the BSF makes up the inner layer. Odisha Police is providing peripheral security. Amid tackling a cyclone and guarding EVMs, how did you manage an encounter in which five Maoists were killed? After rebels killed a worker on election duty in Kandhamal, we had intensified surveillance. We had specific intelligence about a group of Maoist cadres having food at a place. We formed five teams, four of Special Operation Group personnel and another of district voluntary force. When such an operation is planned, we wait till night before taking action. On Wednesday, we took a calculated risk and reached the spot during the day, within four hours of receiving the inputs. The rebels were caught unawares but they reacted by firing at our personnel. In the exchange, a rebel was killed at one spot and four others were killed while trying to escape.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

I was disturbed seeing the devastation and suffering of the people. Since the people of Odisha had extended a helping hand to Nepal in 2015, I thought of giving back,\" she said.

She was addressing a workshop on 'Climate Change - Present Scenario' organized by the climate cell of the state's forest and environment department in association with the Centre's department of science and technology. In 1999, when the Super Cyclone hit the state, mangroves forests along Kendrapada's coast significantly reduced the number of deaths there. \"The mangroves also reduced livestock loss and property damage then. The death toll would have been more if there were no mangroves in the villages of Kendrapada,\" Padhy said. Referring to Fani, Padhy said the storm claimed more than 60 lives and caused massive damage to infrastructure in the coastal districts and in Bhubaneswar. Shankar Narayan Bez, a botanist and convener of the Eco Club in Ganjam, said the trail of destruction caused by Cyclone Phailin in Ganjam district would have been lesser if there were mangroves along the district's coast. \"Climate change gives rise to cyclones in the coastal regions,\" the convener added. \"The risk of climate change not only affects the environment but several other sectors,\" said Ashish Kumar Behera, the divisional forest officer (DFO), Berhampur. The DFO added that 23 lakh samplings will be planted in the district this year under various schemes of the government.

The court issued the order after finding that the tax authorities had in the case of Tata Sponge Iron Ltd levied value added tax (VAT) on the export sale of carbon credit which was never pointed out in the AVR. Such assessment of tax violated an Orissa high court ruling given more than six years ago and was tantamount to contempt of court, the Court observed, invoking a ruling given by the Gujarat high court that said \"if the decision of the high court is not followed by the subordinate officers it will amount to contempt\". In 2012, the Orissa high court had in its ruling in the case of Bhusan Power & Steel Ltd restricted assessing authorities to observations made in the AVR while framing assessment. \"Registry is directed to communicate the order to the commissioner of sales tax who shall in turn communicate the same to all concerned instructing them to comply with the direction of the Court as well as the law decided by the Gujarat high court (1982) in its letter and spirit otherwise, it will amount to contempt of the Court or the Supreme Court\", the division bench of Chief Justice KS Jhaveri and Justice KR Mohapatra said in its order.

Trading was badly affected at the mandi - the state's biggest wholesale market for essential commodities. For nearly a week, it remained dark after sunset. With nearly 1,200 commercial establishments spread over 25 acres, the Cuttack Malgodown differs from other mandis in that it starts functioning at 1 pm everyday. The shutters are kept up well into the night. Normally, it sees transaction of over Rs 50 crore a day. \"Business dropped by nearly 50 per cent as retailers did not enter the area after sunset and traders felt unsafe about keeping their shops open,\" said Praffula Chatoi, secretary of the Cuttack Chamber of Commerce, the umbrella organization for Malgodown traders. Apart from big retailers in the city and the district, those from neighbouring districts like Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapada, Dhenkanal, Angul, Jajpur and parts of Khurda depend on the Cuttack Malgodown. Power supply was restored after the labourers at the Malgodown staged a protest and forced the traders to down their shutters on Friday. Water supply in the trading zone has also been restored. Nearly a 1,000 labourers including trolley rickshaw-pullers depend on Malgodown for a living. The traders of Cuttack Malgodown said they were upset with the administration for not reciprocating the cooperation they had extended in providing relief materials since May 2. \"We were left in the lurch with no power and water for nearly seven days. Cyclone debris was not cleared till garbage collection was resumed in the entire area after a week on Friday. The collector was requested for several things repeatedly, but in vain,\" a cross-section of traders said. The traders were peeved at the alleged apathy of the civic administration in ensuring timely clearance of drains. As the existing drains remain permanently choked, the discharge of waste water is a perennial problem. \"As the drains were choked, the stormwater flooded the godowns,\" Chatoi said. The Cuttack Chamber of Commerce secretary said 30 per cent of the business establishments had been affected by Fani; either their tin roofs tore or were blown away or their godowns were flooded. \"The loss caused is yet to be assessed,\" he said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The doctors of the hospital worked while wearing black badges. \"All doctors are supporting the cause but closing down the OPD would cause severe inconvenience to the public. So we staged a protest and wore black badges,\" said deputy superintendent of the hospital, Dhananjay Dash. Thousands of patients were seen returning from hospitals after failing to get OPD treatment. \"We had registered for paediatric OPD earlier. We learnt about the strike after coming here. Our child is crying a lot and we have no option but to return home,\" said Naresh Sahu, who came to AIIMS-Bhubaneswar from Khurda. \"We did not have any intention of putting patients in trouble.

The 40-ft-long bus was developed by the Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSMCRI) at Bhavnagar in Gujarat in 2007-08. Realizing the plight of the Fani-affected people, the CSMCRI sent the bus from Gujarat to Puri on May 7, four days after Fani devastated the coastal district. The indigenously developed bus can purify more than 40,000 litres of drinking water per day. Led by senior scientist Dr Sanjay Patil, the bus reached Bhubaneswar on May 8 and conducted a site survey in Puri district with the officials of Panchayati Raj and drinking water department. \u201cWe are working in coordination with the state rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) division. Our bus is moving to affected areas as per the guidance of the RWSS. We were stationed in several villages in Kakatpur and Satyabadi areas in the district since May 9,\u201d said Bhoumik Sutaria, a CSMCRI scientist associated with the high-tech bus. Patil said the bus\u2019s plant can purify contaminated turbid, brackish and saline water and make it potable and good for drinking. The bus has a reverse osmosis (RO) desalination and ultra-filtration plant and consists of thin-film composite membrane filtration that can remove viruses and bacteria from water. \u201cAt present, we are purifying at least 4,000 litres of water from ponds per hour. The purified water is being filled in RWSS tankers for smooth supply,\u201d Sutaria said. The bus works on 23 kilowatt power produced by generator attached to the vehicle\u2019s engine. \u201cWe currently face power supply problem in Odisha and are using the generator. The bus has also solar panels on its roof and can draw part of the solar power to maintain basic energy needs,\u201d he said. Villagers at Biragobindpur where the bus was stationed on Tuesday heaved a sigh of relief after getting pure drinking water. \u201cWe are obliged to the CSMCRI for sending us the bus to our village in this crisis time. We were struggling to get drinking water as our village pond was filled with garbage, tree branches and dust,\u201d said Subrata Mishra, a villager. Sources said the specially designed bus was mobilized in a number of states, hit by natural calamities in the past. The CSMCRI had despatched the bus to Odisha during flash floods in 2013 and quenched the thirst of countless villagers in Ganjam, Kendrapada and Jagatsinghpur districts.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

BJP managed to win only from one assembly seat. I will rate my performance as exemplary. Didn\u2019t Modi wave work in your favour?The Modi wave was a Pan-India phenomenon. Besides, BJP workers worked very hard and we had supporters at the grassroots level. People wanted a change and it happened. It was a fight between two family members of Balangir\u2019s extended royal family. How do you feel after defeating your brother-in-law?It is simply an election battle. Family has its own values and exclusiveness. I had to face defeat twice in 2009 and 2014 and my brother-in-law had won. With this win, it will be your fourth term as MP from the seat.

I will ensure that it happens. Besides, I will also lay emphasis on employment generation of youths. Farmers\u2019 woes is another big area that needs attention. People have a lot of expectation from their MP in Balangir because it is a backward region. How do you plan to deal with them?I will try to bring more projects to the district for poverty alleviation. However, it is too early to say what new plans I will have to counter poverty. You are from BJP and won from Balangir Lok Sabha but Congress veteran Narasingha Mishra retained Balangir assembly seat.He is my colleague. We have worked together earlier too.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught.

As things stand today, the process of opening of packets received in the second phase is still on and the number of affidavits received is expected to go up by another seven lakh.  In the first phase, the commission had received 8.17 lakh affidavits claiming compensation by October 31, 2013.  The commission invited fresh affidavits again in November last year and there was an equally overwhelming response by January 31, the last date fixed for receiving affidavits.  What's more worrying is that the commission is yet to start the process of digitization of the affidavits received in the second phase.  The process of digitization involves scanning of the affidavits and preparation on the basis of the data base of the investors.  Commission secretary Devraj Rout said the approval of the sate government has been sought for undertaking the digitization of the huge number of affidavits received in the second phase.  \"The digitization process will start soon after the approval from the government is received\", Rout told TOI on Saturday.  The commission has been identifying duped small investors with genuine records of deposits of Rs 10,000 and below from among the around 8.17 lakh affidavits received by it in the first phase.  The huge work that remains to be done can be gauged from the fact that the process of identifying large investors - those who had invested more than Rs 10,000 - from among the 8.17 lakh affidavits is still on.  The term of the commission was last extended on February 5 by six months till August 4. When constituted on July 9, 2013 Justice RK Patra was appointed as the head of the single-member judicial commission to submit report in three months.

The last interim report submitted on February 12 had recommended 1.43 lakh small investors eligible for compensation.  Commission officials said that during the course of the identification of investors, it was evident from different sources that many investors who had been duped by unauthorized deposit collection companies, had not been able to file affidavits for claiming compensation.  \"So the commission felt if affidavits are not called for again it would be inequitable as many would be left out,\" the commission secretary said Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Cuttack for prohibition of sex determination test": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/cuttack-for-prohibition-of-sex-determination-test/articleshow/69785488.cms", "time": "2019-06-14 13:07:00", "description": "CUTTACK: Cuttack district collector Arvind Agarwal on Thursday directed health officials to ensure the implementation of the Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Technique (PCPNDT) Act to ensure prohibition of unauthorised sex determination tests here.

The committee in a ground survey report revealed that the area proposed for use or used by M/s Essar Steel India Limited had the characteristics of forest, containing 20,003 trees of different varieties.

For now the police are removing the number plates and creating awareness. \"But we will impose fines in the days to come,\" he added. \"The number plate of the vehicle is its identity and most criminals and anti-social elements use bikes with fancy number plates to hide their identity from police. There are instances when chain snatchers have fled and people could not identify the registration number because of the use of fancy plates. There are also instances of thieves stealing motorcycles and using fancy number plates to hide its identity. The drive against such number plates will help in curbing crime,\" Udgata said. He also complained about youths indulging in rash driving. \"We have installed CCTV cameras to monitor rash driving and criminal activities. The cameras have been installed at 16 strategic locations in the city. Four CCTV cameras have been installed in each location. But it often becomes difficult to identify the fancy number plates in CCTV. Hence, it is essential to enforce that proper number plates are used,\" he added.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The court felt it was forthcoming from the confessional statement of co-accused Alok Prusty that Ranjita made firearms and ammunition available for extortion of money by associates of the notorious gangster siblings - Sushant Dhalsamant and Sushil Dhalsamant. \"I am not inclined to release the petitioner (Ranjita Biswal) on bail for the larger interest of society as there is an apprehension that she will repeat the same and might threaten the prosecution witness being a corporator and veteran criminal of the locality,\" Judge Sushree Rajalaxmi Pattanaik observed while rejecting Ranjita's bail plea. \"The prosecution case revealed a strong prima facie against the petitioner for commission of offence which is very serious in nature,\" the Judge further observed in her May 15 order, a copy of which was available on Friday. According to the order, the co-accused had confessed that Ranjita along with the other associates of the Dhalsamant brothers, who are hardened criminals engaged in extortion, had encouraged youngsters to take up criminal activities under her leadership. Prusty also confessed that their team would deposit the arms and ammunition with Ranjita after committing the criminal activities. \"Further basing on the confessional statements of the co-accused, police had seized the illegal arms and ammunition from the petitioner. This speaks of the conduct of the accused petitioner,\" the Judge observed. Initially, police had picked up Prusty after he was found to possess a country-made single-shot pistol with an iron barrel, brass body and wooden grip along with live ammunition. \"Based on the information given by Prusty, police raided the house of Ranjita Biswal at Deula Sahi and seized one 9mm pistol and a 7mm pistol with magazines along with five rounds of live ammunition.

This has prompted mango farmers to urge the government to provide insurance to them. \"There is huge demand for the mangoes of Odisha in other states because of their flavour and size. The mangoes are organically grown and ripened. Our farmers neither use fertilisers nor carbide to ripen the fruit,\" said Paresh Bhanja, a mango farmer in Koraput, at the five-day mango festival organized by Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society (ORMAS), which began here on Saturday. He said varieties such as Amrapalli and Mallika had many takers in Delhi, Raipur and Bokaro, among other cities. Cyclone Fani, which had ripped through coastal Odisha on May 3, has damaged over 60 per cent of the mangoes grown in the state. \"We could not save them. Most were felled by strong winds. The state government provides crop insurance to paddy farmers and should start something similar for us, mango growers,\" Bhanja added. At the festival, farmers from eight districts have presented over 10 varieties of mangoes, including Mallika, Dassehri, Amrapalli, Lengda, Sundari, Bombay Green, Totapali, and Baiganpalei. \"We supply around 80-100 MT of mangoes to Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand, besides selling them in bulk in local and state markets. This year, over 60 per cent of our mangoes fell before they could be harvested,\" said Paltan Hembram, a member of Maa Ambika Mango Producers' Group from Udala block in Mayurbhanj district. Storms also damaged huge quantities of mangoes before they could ripen. \"This year, we supplied about 10 MT of mangoes to Delhi,\" said Leban Soren, another member of the group. \"As the varieties available in the local markets are mostly brought from other states and are artificially ripened, the festival in the city is a big hit because of the organically grown mangoes. After witnessing the extent of the damage caused by the cyclone, we were surprised to see any mango left on the trees,\" said Rajashree Sahu, a housewife. Odisha produces around 18 to 20 lakh MT of mangoes of over 200 varieties every year. The major mango-growing districts are Dhenkanal, Angul, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj, Jajpur, Cuttack, Sonepur and Deogarh. Besides, districts like Kandhamal, Kalahandi, Koraput and Rayagada harvest some late varieties. Mango is cultivated on around two lakh hectares in the state, with 10,000 hectares getting added every year, official sources said.

Unauthorized parking of buses during idle hours along the stretch has been adding to the congestion on the busy thoroughfare, said a traffic cop. Traffic officials claimed idle parking of buses had gone down considerably during the daytime since a temporary parking place was developed near Madhupatna a few years ago. But things have gone haywire in recent months due to the ongoing construction of underground sewage system under the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) assisted integrated sanitation project along the Link Road, said a traffic official. Assistant commissioner of police (Traffic) Jatin Panda said the problem has already been taken up with the JICA officials and they have sought 15 days time to clear the hindrance posed due to the project work in the area. \"We will clear all unauthorized parking of buses along Link Road after that. We will also ensure shifting of vehicles which are left idle along the stretch due to general breakdown,\" Panda said. Obstruction of any form along the busy thoroughfare will be dealt with sternly, he said.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa.

And if their indigenous rain forecast method is anything to go by, the state is going to get a good monsoon this year with plentiful rain for three months. This prediction was made on Saturday by tribal priests during the Birpani Parab, a festival during which rituals are performed to predict the annual rainfall and appease the Birapani deity for a good harvest. It's a festival that falls on a Saturday, on the sixth or the tenth day of the lunar month of Jyestha, where thousands from the Paraja, Halwa, Pentia and Bhumia tribes, dressed up in their traditional attire, gather at the Kodanmali hilltop near Gadapadar village under Jeypore block to appease the goddess. The place of worship is marked by three water holes set in a straight line with rough circular openings. According to tribal beliefs, the first and the second holes symbolise Birpani and Dongar Dei. The third one symbolises Bhairab-the attendant of the two goddesses. It is believed that one of the three holes belonging to the deity (Birpani) pumps out water from the earth and the force with which the water gushes out indicates the arrival of rain. \"I insert my right hand into the hole to feel the quantity of water and its intensity. It is on the basis of these observations that I predict the onset of the monsoon and the quality of harvest,\" says Bhagaban Bhumia, the chief priest. \"We have been following this tradition since times immemorial and our prediction has never gone wrong. This year, the state will receive good rain for three months,\" he adds. Jeypore MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati says the tribal priests predicting the quantity of rainfall has never ever gone wrong.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

According to the recent Crime Branch letter to the SPs, a number of instances were reported where accused persons escaped from the police custody during their transit for appearance in the court. Crime Branch sources said at least 9 arrested persons escaped from the police custody in connection with separate crimes in 2018. \u201cIn cases of heinous offences, including Naxalism, it is a challenge for the police to safely produce the accused persons in court,\u201d additional director general of police (Crime Branch) Santosh Upadhyay said. The Crime Branch\u2019s concern assumes significance as an alleged Maoist had escaped from the police custody in Nuapada district last year, leaving the police red-faced. Manoj Madkami, who was arrested by Nuapada district police in May 2018, jumped the police custody from court premises on September 18, 2018. Madkami is still on the run. The incident had happened when Madkami was being taken back to jail from the court. At least seven cops were suspended for negligence and dereliction of duty. In order to avoid escape of hard core criminals, the Crime Branch has suggested the SPs to produce the former in court through electronic video linkage. Crime Branch said the concerned police stations should move the court, seeking approval to produce the accused via video conference. \u201cWe have electronic video linkage in the jails and courts. Since arrested persons are compulsorily produced in court in regular interval, the apprehension of their escape cannot be ruled out. Police stations should not take the risk of transporting dreaded criminals to court and use the technology for their safe appearance before the judge,\u201d another Crime Branch officer said. Authorities in some jails and courts said the video linkage and internet connectivity was damaged after Cyclone Fani battered Odisha on May 3. Prisons officials said the technicians are already on the job to restore the service. \u201cWe have partly restored the service in some prisons,\u201d a jail officer said.
