Speaking to reporters at his residence, Baig, who categorically refused to take queries on his name being dragged into the IMA Group Ponzi scheme, said he was paying the price for being forthright with his views. \u201cIt is obvious that I have been targeted by the state leadership,\u201d Baig said. \u201cIs it a crime to speak the truth? I have the highest regard and respect for AICC president Rahul Gandhi. I never criticised him. I am a worker of the Indian National Congress, not Siddaramaiah Congress.\u201d Baig claimed party workers would second his comments against senior leaders. He had called AICC general secretary KC Venugopal a buffoon, criticised what he called Siddaramaiah\u2019s \u201carrogant attitude\u201d and described KPCC president Dinesh Gundurao as a flop leader. \u201cIf speaking the truth amounts to anti-party activity, then let it be,\u201d Baig said. \u201cIn a democracy, such open and transparent discussions [his comments against leaders] are required to strengthen the party. Closed-door discussions within the four walls of a hall will not help.\u201d Baig also took exception to being singled out for disciplinary action, claiming others who had openly worked against the Congress during the Lok Sabha elections got away without so much as a slap on the wrist. \u201cCongress leaders in Mandya openly campaigned for independent Sumalatha Ambareesh,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Tumakuru, former MLA KN Rajanna worked against the coalition candidate HD Deve Gowda, party leaders openly said they will defeat KH Muniyappa in Kolar, a senior Dalit leader and former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi has been continuing his tirade against the party, but no action has been taken against any of these people. Why action only against me? For speaking the truth?\u201d The Shivajinagar MLA said he will discuss with senior leaders Mallikarjun M Kharge, Ramalinga Reddy, Muniyappa, HK Patil and his supporters before firming up future plans. \u201cAfter that, I will take a call whether I need to go to New Delhi,\u201d he said.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Kumaraswamy, 19, from Tumakuru, suffered a spinal injury and is undergoing treatment at Victoria hospital. Dancers say backflip is one of the most difficult moves in street style and hip-hop dancing and practising it cannot be a casual affair. Shilpa Somananthan, a dance expert who won the first place in the World Dance Championship (2018-2019), said: \u201cThree major factors matter while doing a backflip: Physical strength, presence of mind and a partner who is understanding. Even if one of these goes wrong, the dancer can easily fall and break neck.\u201d She said dancers with basic gymnastic training are better equipped to perform this move. She also pointed out that the partner needs to be firm on the ground and his/her legs must be positioned in a way that allows the dancer to run and step on his/her knees and flip in the air. \u201cA person needs to practice on the crash mat, sand or soft bed before doing it on any other surface,\u201d Shilpa said. Bharatanatyam dancer Sneha Nair said mental strength is more important than anything else while performing acrobatics in dance. A dancer normally takes a month to learn the art and two months to master the act, until which support would be advisable. \u201cMany times, our children fall and injure their legs or bruise their hand. We always keep a pillow to ensure neck is not damaged,\u201d she added. \u2018He did not use right flooring\u2019On what could have caused Kumaraswamy\u2019s accident, street dancer Princy William, who has been practising the act for eight years, said: \u201cHe did not use the right flooring to do it and his partner did not lift him properly.\u201d Kumaraswamy\u2019s relative Bharath M said the dancer\u2019s spinal cord is broken. \u201cHe tried the act twice and they were perfect. When he attempted it for the third time, it went wrong,\u201d he said. Denying that Kumaraswamy was attempting to do a Tik-Tok video which was being recorded by his friend, Bharath said the incident happened 10 days ago though the video went viral on Tuesday.

The CM came half an hour late to inaugurate the operation theatre block.

Thursday\u2019s Kidwai episode \u2014 denying treatment to patients for hours in the name of an event involving the CM \u2014 seems to have breached basic hospital protocols. Ambulances, too, were held up indiscriminately. Improving facilities at government hospitals is much needed, but by being insensitive to patients on such occasions, the authorities have done more harm than good. It\u2019s high time steps were taken to end the obnoxious display of VIP culture on roads, especially in a city like Bengaluru which is already choked with traffic.Most patients were caught unawares as there was no public notice about the event and strict restrictions on vehicle movement. The hour-long VIP visit triggered chaos on the road too: Several commuters were stuck on stretches surrounding the venue as vehicles piled up due to traffic restrictions. Ambulances, too, were stopped by traffic police to allow the CM\u2019s convoy to pass through. Hassan, who came for the treatment of his one-year-old son Subhan, said it took hours for all the proceedings and formalities to get over. \u201cWe\u2019ve come from very far for treatment, but were denied even entry into the hospital for such a long time,\u201d he rued. Minister for health and family welfare Shivanand S Patil, who was on his way to attend the event, was also stuck in traffic. \u201cThe minister\u2019s securitymen alerted cops after which they let him in.

The play travels way back in time to pluck a portion of India\u2019s history that is more relevant now than ever before. Through the plot that revolves around an intellectual discourse about a religious succession in a matha of the Pala Empire in the eighth century, the play sheds light on a historical milieu when the ideas of Hinduism were challenged by those of Buddhism, even though the latter was on the brink of an imminent decline. Muktidham\u2019s uncanny parallels with the country\u2019s current ideas about nationalism is quite evident. \u201cThe play piques one to rethink the common argument placed by the right-wing movement that their faith is under threat now. This only reflects how they still dwell on an imagined history,\u201d says the playwright-director.  The two-hour play features a cast of prominent actors including Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwini Kumar Chakre, Ipshita Chakraborty SIngh, Irawati Karnik, Kumud Mishra, Neel Sengupta, MD Pallavi, Pratyush Singh, Sandeep Shikhar and Shubhrajyoti Barat. Apart from an extensive tour of Uttar Pradesh \u2013 covering Bareilly, Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Allahabad, Delhi and Agra \u2013 the play has also travelled to Pune and Goa, and has even won awards in 2018.  Back to Ranga Shankara, where it premiered in 2017, it\u2019s bit of a reunion for the cast and crew of the play. But why wrap up the play so soon? \u201cIt will only be the closing shows of this particular production. The text of the play is published and available for theatre groups, if they want to adapt it into another performance. Muktidham was the first play we travelled so much with. And, we have had actors from every place we visited becoming part of the cast. Travelling with a production has its own limitations, and right now we want to concentrate on newer plays,\u201d says Vivek Madan, of Bhasha Centre that is presenting the play. Light design for the show is done by Anmol Vellani, while music and sound design is handled by Abhijeet Tambe and Pallavi. Tracing the dilemma\u2026The story is set in a time when the Pala kings, who followed Buddhism, were ruling the east and large parts of northern India. It is about this Hindu temple town, called Beerpur, which is surrounded by Buddhists. The protagonist of the play is Agnivesh, a scholar in the matha. Its head, Nath Nand, who is about to retire, is in a dilemma as to who among his students should become his successor. Will it be Yuyutsu, who believes in opening up the doors of the temple for the lower castes, or Agnivesh, who believes in raising an armed resistance to Buddhism? 00:35Muktidham's last run of shows in BengaluruDownload The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "'Bigg Boss Kannada' fame Jaganath Chandrashekar's wedding reception": {"link": "http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/events/bangalore/bigg-boss-kannada-fame-jaganath-chandrashekars-wedding-reception/articleshow/69535795.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Government will strengthen law to stop attacks on doctors: CM": {"datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-will-strengthen-law-to-stop-attacks-on-doctors-cm/articleshow/69881460.cms", "time": "2019-06-21 08:23:00", "description": "BENGALURU: In the wake of attacks on medical fraternity across the country, the government will strengthen the Karnataka Prohibition of Violence Against Medicare Service Personnel and Damage to Property in Medicare Service Institutions Act-2009, chief minister HD Kumaraswamy said on Thursday.

HAL spokesman Gopal Sutar, however, sought to downplay his colleagues\u2019 concerns over the lake\u2019s rejuvenation; the water body is being cleaned, desilted and deweeded. \u201cHAL does get involved with civic authorities in ensuring the area around its airport is taken care of, for instance in matters of garbage disposal, so that birds such as kites feeding on garbage are kept at bay. In this particular case (Bellandur Lake renovation), we cannot comment on the extent of our involvement,\u201d said Sutar. \u2018Cleaner lake welcome\u2019\u201cHowever, a cleaner lake is welcome as it\u2019d ensure reduced bird population, especially of varieties like kites which feed on garbage and swoop down on filthy surroundings. In clean surroundings, water birds may not pose a risk, unlike kites. In any case, we have a mechanism to deal with bird menace and ensure safe tests of our flights,\u201d added Sutar.

In fact, when the revenue department questioned him last December on whether IMA had obtained permission from the RBI and Sebi, the IMA founder-owner replied: \u201cWe do not deal with financial instruments. We deal with metals such as gold, silver, copper, nickel and precious stones. Hence, the need does not arise to obtain any permission from RBI or Sebi.\u201d TOI has accessed a copy of the reply Khan sent to the authorities on December 14 when his firm\u2019s transactions raised the suspicions of revenue officials and they made moves to attach IMA\u2019s properties. Maintaining his stand that IMA had never collected deposits from the public, leaving police with no jurisdiction to take action against him, Khan said his mode of business was a limited liability partnership (LLP) governed under the LLP Act, 2008, under the purview of the registrar of companies (RoC) of the Union ministry of corporate affairs. \u201cFrom the outset, Khan tried to mislead state authorities by citing the RoC,\u201d said BC Thiruvengadam, a company lawyer who has dealt with similar cases. \u201cBut the fact of the matter was that the bullion business he was taking about is under the ambit of commodities market regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC), which the government merged with Sebi in 2015. So Khan could not have run his business without permission from Sebi.\u201d On Khan\u2019s claim that his company had never dealt with financial instruments, Thiruvengadam said while LLPs attract company laws, Sebi and the RBI could, in coordination with the state government, have moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and attached IMA\u2019s properties. \u201cThe authorities took a similar step in the Satyam case before they attached Ramalinga Raju\u2019s properties,\u201d Thiruvengadam said. But Khan may have inadvertently been helped by the state government\u2019s withdrawal of the assistant commissioner\u2019s powers to attach properties after he replied to its notice. \u201cThe powers were withdrawn for a technical reasons, but that move helped Khan get off the hook,\u201d said assistant commissioner, revenue, LC Nagaraj. After the scam broke out, however, chief secretary TM Vijayabhaskar convened a meeting of senior officials at which it was decided to restore the assistant commissioner\u2019s powers to attach properties in such cases.

Over the last couple of weeks, the Kannada Development Authority (KDA) has held talks with Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) officials on teaching Kannada in these schools. However, the KDA has been told that most of the 50 KVs in the state do not have teachers or students for the language. According to the KDA, Kannada as a language has been made mandatory in all schools, including KVs in the state, under the Kannada Language Learning Act, 2015.\u201cHowever, it has come to light that KVs are not teaching the language due to lack of students. We are seeking clarifications from the state government and the Centre on this,\u201d said KDA chairman SG Siddaramaiah. Sources in KDA say, KVs are trying to \u201cevade\u201d teaching Kannada, as it\u2019d mean additional budgetary and academic burden on them. \u201cThey show Kannada as an option initially and later withdraw the same, even if parents are keen on their wards learning the language. For example, in Mysuru, there are only five students at one KV. However, the school principal has said they require at least 20 students to offer Kannada as a language option. This means those five students will have to study Sanskrit, the only other third-language option in the state,\u201d said one KDA member. KVS authorities admit there is shortage of teachers and students for the language. \u201cAs per our sangathan policy, a regional language can be taught at our institutions only if there are 20 or more students in each of our schools. Even for this, we have to budget for a language teacher on contract and cannot hire permanent staff,\u201d explained one senior KVS official. The authorities, however, were quick to add that though they were keen on implementing the regional language as a subject, they haven\u2019t done so also due to a particular point in the Kannada Language Learning Act. \u201cThe Act mentions only private, aided and state government schools. However, there is no mention of central government schools. Effectively, this does make it difficult for the sangathan to implement the regional language policy,\u201d said a senior KVS official. However, with the KDA and KV officials having held discussion, the regional office will be writing to the sangathan in New Delhi on how best to address the issue. Q-papers, marksheets, PhD submissions in KannadaThe state has issued a government order asking all varsities in Karnataka to issue bilingual question papers, marksheets and PhD summaries. It has also instructed universities to allow students in all courses to write exams in the language of their choice, options being English and Kannada. The order has already been implemented by the six agriculture and horticulture universities, while 18 other varsities are yet to implement the same.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Instead it was glasses and glasses of rice beer and a chicken sacrifice that welcomed Devang Singh and Varud Gupta when they visited Rongmesek, a tiny village in Meghalaya, to observe a holy ceremony that was being conducted by the Karbi tribe. Singh and Gupta had undertaken the trip as part of research for their recently- launched book, Bhagwaan ke Pakwaan. The book, as the name suggests, is an indepth, incisive yet tongue-in-cheek exploration of India\u2019s aeons-old temple food traditions, which continue to thrive and satiate the hunger pangs of millions of visitors, irrespective of their religious beliefs. \u201cWe were quietly taken to the site of the chicken sacrifice. One of the interesting sights that still remains with me was watching the village elder clean the intestine of the chicken with rice beer,\u201d says Singh with a pause for added effect. It takes some time for one to digest the fact that an offering to god needn\u2019t be limited to a laddoo, pedha or payasam. \u201cWhen we set out to write the book we were clear that we didn\u2019t want to write a pious book, nor was it going to focus only on prasad or bhog (the food served to god). We instead wanted to look at how food and faith mix, and in our country, they have always mixed,\u201d says Singh. This search for the seamsless marriage of food and faith took Singh and Gupta to certain unusual locations: Rongmesek, the Christian village in Meghalaya; a monastery in Spiti valley; the Jewish Synagogue in Kolkata; Udvada, Gujarat which is the most sacred fire temple for Parsis in the country; and the Jagannath Temple in Puri that is famous for the 56-course meals that are served every day, all year. Last Sunday, at Ahara, a food and wellness workshop that was held in Bengaluru, musician and popular food and travel TV host Rakesh Raghunathan took his audiences on a sensorial journey as he spoke, sang and gave a live demonstration of the preparation of Akkaraadisal (rice cooked in milk with jaggery). A prasadam that is offered at the Srivilliputtur Andal temple, Tamil legend says that this was the food that Andal had promised Lord Ranganatha if he married her. \u201cShe promised to make him 100 thadas (tanks) of Akkaraadisal and 100 thadas of ghee,\u201d narrated Raghunathan who made a presentation called Sacred Offerings at the event. \u201cIt is a popular presentation series that I have made on our temple food traditions. The idea here is to try and appeal to the five senses of the audience through music, food and mythological stories.\u201d For Raghunathan, a keen foodie since he can remember, exploring temple food traditions is an offshoot of his wider interest in documenting south India\u2019s culinary variety. \u201cI have been documenting less-known recipes that have been handed down generations and it was during my travels that I got curious about temple food,\u201d he says. \u201cDoing research on prasadam, I realised, was a great way to learn about local regions, their geographies, agricultural practices, the local produce and their cooking traditions,\u201d he says, before noting how a common temple prasadam as simple as a puliyogare (tamarind rice) varied from one state to another. \u201cWhat\u2019s unique about temple cuisine is that it is adapted to suit the place. So, if in Kerala you have temples offering prasadam made with jaggery/or jackfruit(the local produce), in Andhra, where the climate e common offer- panakkam, a drink that helps cool your body.\u201d A PRACTICE OF FEEDING PEOPLE \u201cThe practice of naivedya \u2013 one of the sixteen upacaras acts) of a puja orship) \u2013 seems have been in from at least the f Ramayana\u2019s on, where we learn of the recommendation that naivedya should be what everyone\u2019s food was. Modern-day priests offer more pragmatic explanations for the development of the naivedya and prasad tradition. Babu Shastri, one of the head priests of the Kanchipuram Kamatciyamma Temple, told me that he suspected that the naivedya tradition developed because devotees would come from far away, or at least travel a great length of time to come to a temple and see a deity,\u201d explains Andrea Gutierrez, Researcher, University of Texas. SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRACTICES \u201cWhen we set down to write the book, we didn\u2019t want to look at temple food only on basis of taste, but also on how they came about. In Spiti, for instance, the food served in monasteries is nonvegetarian because that is their staple diet. And there used to be a time when they\u2019d cook kala mattar (black pea), which is tastier than green peas but that has become rare now. Similarly in Meghalaya, rice beer was a part of every ritual,\u201d explains Singh. The biggest takeaway from writing the book for Singh has been about learning how temple food, minus the religious angle, epitomized sustainable food practices, be it in using local, seasonal ingredients or using sustainable slow cooking methods. \u201cThe reason that food cooked in temples tastes so good is because it is cooked with a lot of devotion, but there\u2019s also technique involved. Use of fresh local ingredients, cooking all components of a dish from scratch, and the fact that it is cooked without being tasted because it is a holy offering differentiates it from other cuisines we have,\u201d says chef Aditya Fatepuria, who runs Sattvam restaurant and is one of the few who has trained in cooking food based on sattvic principles. \u201cTemple food was almost always made using seasonal food. Historically, for instance, dishes were made only using indigenous ingredients like moong dal and pepper. Items like chillies came later. Even today, if you look at the offering made during the yearly observance of the departed, only moong dal is used. And only country vegetables like snake gourd, bitter gourd and raw bananas are used,\u201d explains Raghunathan. As someone who holds workshops and has hosted temple food festivals for five star hotels, Raghunathan says that these initiatives are attempts to make people aware of our heritage. \u201cThese are recipes that are 1000s of years old. I think we have taken our food legacy for granted and so I do this because I want to share it with everybody.\u201d Unusual Temple Foods From dried fish and toddy to insect chutney and rice beer, there are holy spaces in India that serve prasadam that is not conservative by any measure. \u201cThe Karbi tribe make a chutney made out of cicadas (insects that appear once in four years), and I think that was probably the most unusual sacred offering I have heard of,\u201d says Devang Singh. For Raghunathan, it\u2019s the payasam served at the Suryanallar temple in Kumbakonam that stands out. \u201cI had the priest tell me rather enthusiastically about how the offering was made of broken wheat and not rice because according to myth the Sun God is toothless,\u201d he laughs. Other temples that have unusual offerings include the Sri Muthappan Temple in Kannur, Kerala where toddy and dried fish is served. The Muniyandi Swami temple in Vadakkampatti, Tamil Nadu holds a three-day festival in January where over 2,000 kg of rice and mutton is cooked and served to devotees. Meals Ready It would be a rueful comment from his mentor, Darshini man R Prabhakar, on how none of the restaurants in Bengaluru served food as safe and tasty as a temple meal that would goad Raghavendra Padukone to start Temple Meals in Malleswaram. Placing high emphasis on quality, the food served here takes inspiration from fare served in south Canara temples. \u201cWe do not use onion or garlic, the rice is parboiled, the spices and powders we use are made in Udupi and the vegatables are handpicked,\u201d says Padukone. The formula is a success and its proof is the long line of customers who wait for the tasty elle oota everyday. \u201cWe serve 400-500 meals per day,\u201d says Padukone.

It plans to induct 500 buses under the lease model in the second phase. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for 500 e-buses on a lease model under FAME II, but the Centre is likely to give funds for only 300,\u201d said an official. A decision on the specifications of buses and other infrastructure requirements will be taken in a few weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll send a new proposal to the Centre to avail the FAME II scheme before July 18,\u201d he added. Several states including Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Delhi have already inducted e-buses on a lease basis. The BMTC's earlier plan to induct 80 e-buses on lease basis under FAME-I (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India) was delayed after transport minister DC Thammanna insisted they be purchased. The BMTC board in February had scrapped the earlier tender to induct 80 e-buses on lease and opted for the purchasing model. A BMTC official said it\u2019s a policy decision. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to loss the FAME II subsidy as well. The new tender will plug loopholes in the earlier one,\u201d he added. Another BMTC official said they are exploring both purchase and lease model. \"If there is financial assistance from the state government, then we will purchase e-buses\". However, 80 e-buses would have hit the city roads by now if the BMTC had gone ahead with its earlier proposal. These buses were supposed to start service in August 2018 itself. Under FAME-II scheme, department of heavy industry had invited expressions of interest from state transport departments for deployment of 5,000 e-buses across the country under the operational cost model. Six firms keen on project Under criticism for delay in inducting e-buses, cash-strapped BMTC in March had called expressions of interest from global firms to supply 1,500 electric buses in another five years. However, the corporation is not in a financial position to procure 1,500 vehicles, each costing between Rs 1 crore and Rs 2 crore, without support from the Centre and the state government. The state has so far not committed any financial assistance to purchase e-buses. Sources said six companies \u2014 Olectra Greentech Ltd, Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors, Edison Motors, JBM Group and AMS Electric Mobility Limited \u2014 have shown interest in the project. In fact, Olectra Greentech Ltd had emerged as the lowest bidder (Rs 37.5 per km to operate AC e-buses and Rs 24.5 per km for non-AC buses) under the lease model in the BMTC\u2019s earlier tender. The BMTC was the first state-run bus corporation in the country to have conducted trial runs of e-buses as early as in 2014. Cash-starved BMTC to borrow Rs 160cr The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has decided to borrow Rs 160 crore to pay off its dues, said sources in the corporation. Sources in BMTC\u2019s accounts department said they have recently invited expression of interest from nationalised/scheduled commercial banks to avail a loan of Rs 160 crore. \u201cThe proposed loan will be drawn in one go. The tenure of the loan will be a period of seven years.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

The comment is another indication of the deepening rift between the two sides and follows reports that Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah advised Rahul Gandhi that they should consider pulling the plug on the coalition to prevent further political damage to the Congress. Siddaramaiah met Rahul in Delhi on Wednesday. In his first presser after the drubbing in the Lok Sabha elections, Gowda said the coalition government in Karnataka was never his idea. \u201cI did not take the initiative to form this government. It was (senior Congress leader) Ghulam Nabi Azad who held my hands and pleaded that Kumaraswamy should become the chief minister.\u201d On his recent meeting with Rahul, Gowda said they didn\u2019t specifically discuss politics, though he requested the Congress president to instruct Congress leaders in Karnataka to stop talking openly against the alliance. \u201cOur leaders will not issue any adverse statements and ensure that there\u2019s no problem to the government. But Congress leaders should also follow suit,\u201d Gowda said, adding that he also asked Rahul to reconsider his decision to quit as the Congress chief over the election debacle. Gowda, who lost the Lok Sabha election from Tumakuru, said he would focus on strengthening the JD(S) and prepare for any eventuality. Siddaramaiah\u2019s meeting with Rahul on Wednesday immediately triggered speculation about the coalition\u2019s future. The former chief minister apparently believes that the tie-up is hurting the Congress at the ground level. \u201cThe party should look to strengthen its base in the state and gear up for the next assembly polls,\u201d Siddaramaiah is said to have told Rahul. \u2018Simultaneous polls will create confusion\u2019Former PM HD Deve Gowda said on Thursday that holding simultaneous polls to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies would create confusion among voters. \u201cI have apprehensions about One Nation, One Election. I feel we are not so advanced,\u201d he told reporters, a day after PM Narendra Modi held an all-party meeting in Delhi to build consensus on the idea. Gowda said under such an exercise, voters would need someone to guide them, something the Election Commission alone cannot do and something political agents were not permitted to. \u201cThere will be one polling booth for Lok Sabha polls and another for the assembly elections. This will create confusion,\u201d he said. Gowda recounted that separate paper slips given to voters during simultaneous polls in some states had resulted in confusion. JD(S) patriarch\u2019s plea to VishwanathGowda said on Thursday that he would urge AH Vishwanath to continue as state JD(S) president in the larger interest of the party. \u201cOur party will hold a meeting on Friday. We will try and persuade Vishwanath to reconsider his decision,\u201d he said. Gowda made the statement moments after Vishwanath threatened that he would give up his assembly membership if the party didn\u2019t accept his resignation from the president\u2019s position. Gowda has called another meeting on June 23, this time with JD(S) leaders who lost in the Lok Sabha elections, to discuss ways to make the party stronger. \u201cBut there will be no discussion on the coalition government or cabinet expansion,\u201d he said.

Asserting that his comments against state Congress leaders were the opinion of the party workers, he said he was in the Indian National Congress headed by Rahul Gandhi and \"not in the Siddu (Siddaramaiah) Congress\". \"Last night, I got the information that I have been suspended from the party...Is it a crime to speak the truth? What I have said is the truth,\" Baig said. Speaking to reporters here, he said he had not criticised Gandhi and that he continued to be a \"disciplined soldier of the party\". \"My criticism of state leaders is true. Is speaking the truth a crime? They have taken action against me. There are some senior leaders and friends in the party like Ramalinga Reddy, H K Patil, Mallikarjun Kharge and K H Muniyappa. I will meet them and discuss with the party workers on whether to go to Delhi and speak there,\" he added. The Congress suspended Baig, a rebel MLA, on Tuesday night with immediate effect, citing his \"anti-party\" activities. Hitting out at Karnataka Congress leaders for the party's dismal show in the Lok Sabha polls, Baig had recently held Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah's \"arrogance\" and KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao's \"immaturity\" responsible for the \"flop show\". He had also called Congress general secretary K C Venugopal a \"buffoon\". Baig had dropped hints of quitting the party and appealed to Muslims to \"compromise\" with the situation on the BJP-led NDA returning to power at the Centre. The Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) had issued a show-cause notice to the MLA for his conduct, to which he had not responded. Noting that Gandhi had offered to resign as the All India Congress Committee (AICC) president, taking responsibility for the poll defeat, Baig said, \"When we criticise here in the state for the party winning only one seat in the Lok Sabha polls, action is being taken.\" \"Muniyappa, who is a senior Dalit leader in the party, was defeated (in Kolar) openly by those within...no action is being taken against them. \"At Mandya, our party leaders openly met and campaigned for (Independent candidate) Sumalatha...no action against them,\" he pointed out, claiming that he was being selectively targeted. Baig said he had ensured a lead for the Congress from his Shivajinagar constituency in the city, while the BJP got ahead in the poll race from the constituencies represented by the KPCC president and the CLP leader respectively. \"What I have said about a few of our state leaders is the opinion of thousands of our karyakartas,\" he said. Baig, a seven-time MLA and a former Karnataka minister, has been unhappy with the state Congress leadership over not being included in the coalition cabinet headed by Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy. The senior leader said he felt \"sorry\" for Gandhi and alleged that the Lok Sabha poll campaign in Karnataka was run in such a way that \"we were not involved and there was no political management\". \"...I have not criticised Rahul Gandhi. He is the Indian National Congress president. I am in the Indian National Congress, not in the Siddu Congress. \"I am a disciplined soldier of the Indian National Congress and was upset about the state of the party in Karnataka. I had said those things after seeing the exit polls, even before the results,\" he said. Gundu Rao had Tuesday said Baig's alleged links with IMA Jewels, which is involved in an alleged financial fraud that duped thousands of investors, would also be brought to the notice of the party's central leadership. State Revenue Minister R V Deshpande had Monday said Baig had introduced the firm's owner, Mohammed Mansoor Khan, to him about two months ago, but denied doing any undue favour to him. Not willing to comment on the IMA Jewels case, Baig said the matter was before a Special Investigation Team (SIT). \"I will tell the SIT whatever I need to,\" he said.

Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Thanks to the near-constant drought, about three-quarters of the estimated 39,000 traditional kalyanis (ponds) and tanks that existed two decades ago across the state have either dried up, been encroached upon or have been turned into sewage dumps, leading to an alarming fall in groundwater levels. With water now scarce in most districts, the government has launched an ambitious project to rejuvenate the state\u2019s age-old water system. Titled Jalamrutha, the community-driven programme is aimed at blunting the impact of climate change and battling drought. \u201cOur focus is on spreading water literacy, rejuvenation and construction of conservation structures, smart use of water and afforestation drives,\u201d said LK Atheeq, principal secretary, rural development and panchayat raj department. \u201cThe goal is to make Karnataka water secure by 2020.\u201d Under the project, the government intends to rejuvenate at least 14,000 lakes and tanks this year with the help of communities at the gram panchayat level. There are about 6,068 gram panchayats in the state. The government will also construct 20,000 check dams across major rivers to retain water upstream to help recharge the groundwater table. \u201cCheck dams also help conserve rainwater as it prevents discharge into the sea,\u201d said a senior RDPR official who is overseeing the project. \u201cThey also provide fresh water bodies for local use and strengthen the ecosystem and local bio-diversity.\u201d Officials say by the end of June, every gram panchayat will have planted 500 saplings in schools, hostels, government buildings and community complexes besides near water bodies and other public places to develop social forestry. \u201cAbout 20 lakh saplings have already been planted,\u201d said Atheeq. \u201cWe are encouraging communities to help nurture two crore saplings.\u201d The state government has earmarked about Rs 5,000 crore for the project and the government has already allocated about Rs 600 crore for the first phase. Construction of check dams, revival of small water bodies and planting of trees will also be funded under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA). However, GN Girish, a green activist, said that while the plan looks good on paper, it may not work. \u201cEvery year, the forest department plants around two crore saplings, but green cover in the state continues to diminish,\u201d Girish said. \u201cGovernment programmes often start with a bang, they fail to deliver.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "BWSSB transfers engineer who pointed out structural flaws in KC Valley project": {"datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bwssb-transfers-engineer-who-pointed-out-structural-flaws-in-kc-valley-project/articleshow/69865133.cms", "time": "2019-06-21 04:51:00", "description": "BENGALURU: A tragedy similar to Monday\u2019s centring crash at BWSSB\u2019s Hebbal sewage treatment plant (STP) that claimed three lives is waiting to happen at a similar structure at KC (Koramangala and Challaghatta) Valley project.

Nasscom was responding to the speculation that the US is mulling a 10%-15% cap on H-1B visas issued to Indians if India does not relax its data localisation mandate. Nasscom said Indian nationals accounted for majority of all approved H-1Bs in fiscal year 2017 and this was a testimony to their skill-set. It said only a small share of these Indian nationals is employed by Indian companies. \u201cThe vast majority of them are sponsored by global and US multinationals,\u201d it said. Nasscom president Debjani Ghosh had told TOI that Indian companies take less than 12% of H-1B visas. Of the 65,000 visas available each year, less than 8,500 go to Indian companies, she said. The visa intake has gone down by about 43% in the past two years, she said.Stephen Yale-Loehr, professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School, said if the Trump administration carries through on reported plans to limit H-1B visas for citizens of India, it would be both bad law and bad policy. \u201cBad law because only Congress can change US immigration laws, which prohibit discrimination based on national origin; the President can\u2019t change that unilaterally. Bad policy because the United States is in a global competition for talent. We would be shooting ourselves in the foot by limiting work visas for talented Indians. Any restrictions would particularly hurt Indian IT companies, which many US companies rely on.\u201d However, Ron Hira, associate professor of graduate studies in the department of political science in Howard University, noted that India has a huge trade surplus with the US, and indicated that a country cap on H-1Bs would not be unwarranted. \u201cIn its nearly thirty years of existence, the H-1B guestworker programme has not had per-country limits or caps, but such a regime is quite common in permanent immigration programmes such as family-based and employment-based lawful permanent residency (green cards). So, the implementation of such a per-country regime should be fairly straightforward to implement and is certainly not outside the norm,\u201d he said.Vijay Govindarajan, Coxe Distinguished Professor at Tuck at Dartmouth, said America\u2019s protectionist backlash against globalisation will hurt no one more than America. \u201cCapping H-1B visas is short-sighted,\u201d he said. Govidarajan said Indian IT companies must use this inflection point to fundamentally change their strategies. \u201cFirst, they should pivot from being service-providers to global multinationals to creating digital business models. Look at the value created by Airbnb, Uber, Google, Alibaba, Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon. India doesn\u2019t lack talent to do this. Second, Indian IT firms must help asset-heavy companies like Tata Steel to embrace digital technologies to create new pockets of value,\u201d he said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Police were told to submit their requirement of equipment to measure noise levels for the entire city. They were also directed to provide security to the petitioners. Meanwhile, the BBMP was directed to undertake an inspection of rooftop bars operating in the area.

The Election Commission had received a complaint which claimed Prajwal didn\u2019t submit actual details of his assets in the affidavit. Manju, who fought the election in Hassan on a BJP ticket, alleged that the grandson of JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda was planning to pre-empt the outcome in the case by resigning as a member of Parliament. \u201cI will write to Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, urging him not to accept Prajwal\u2019s resignation; he is expected to resign after taking oath as the member of the Lok Sabha to pre-empt himself in the false affidavit case,\u201d Manju told reporters in Bengaluru. Prajwal will take oath on Friday. After the results were announced last month, he had offered to vacate the Hassan seat, so Gowda could contest from the constituency. The segment has been a stronghold of the family. Gowda made room for his grandson there and fought from Tumakuru, where he lost. Manju claimed on Thursday that Prajwal\u2019s offer was a ploy by the Gowda family to preempt humiliation and punishment resulting from a potential court ruling against Prajwal in the affidavit case. According to section 125(A) of the Representation of People Act 1951, any candidate who fails to furnish correct information or willingly gives false information in the affidavit can face a prison term of up to six months or a fine, or both. Manju and an advocate, G Devaraje Gowda, had filed the complaint over the affidavit. On May 15, the Hassan Lok Sabha returning officer and then deputy commissioner Priyanka Mary Francis had said the complainants could move court over the issue, quoting a 2014 order by the Election Commission. The order said any aggrieved party could directly approach a court against a false declaration in a candidate\u2019s election affidavit. On the delay in moving court, Manju said he was waiting for the district electoral officer\u2019s report to be submitted in court. He alleged that Prajwal not only concealed facts but also provided misleading information about his assets, including bank balance and land holding.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

I will change gears and make Karnataka the number one state in the country in terms of development. I will win back people\u2019s confidence so much so that they would repent for not voting for us in the Lok Sabha elections,\u201d he said while releasing a booklet on his government\u2019s achievements over the past year. He was accompanied by deputy chief minister G Parameshwara at the event. Kumaraswamy expressed satisfaction over his performance as the leader of the state and said his cabinet made honest efforts to provide good administration despite the pulls and pressures of the coalition format. \u201cFrom the Rs 25,000-crore loan waiver to English medium schools, and from tackling drought successfully to helping victims of the Kodagu floods, my government has done a lot of work. Unfortunately, our work didn\u2019t get much publicity in media,\u201d Kumaraswamy said.

He said he had asked all ministers and MLAs to undertake village stays. \u201cIt will energise the bureaucracy, and boost work,\u201d he added.

My government has been stable, and it will remain stable in future,\u201d he said. He criticised Yeddyurappa for trying to discredit his recent tour of drought-hit districts. \u201cIn private, he has confided in officials that the government is tackling drought effectively, but he cannot say so in public,\u201d Kumaraswamy claimed. He sought to know why Yeddyurappa had not submitted any report or complaint to the government if the latter had detected shortcomings in the drought relief efforts. Meanwhile, Parameshwara dismissed the reported stand of Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah and senior legislator HK Patil that the Congress should severe ties with the JD(S), saying \u201cindividual opinions\u201d don\u2019t count. \u201cThey are all individual opinions and they are different from the collective opinion of the party.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Asserting that there was no threat to his government and that he would complete its remaining 4-year term despite differences with the ally over several issues, the chief minister sought to blame the BJP for creating uncertainty and attempting to destabilise his ministry by wooing the ruling allies' legislators to defect to the saffron fold. \"Though you all are happy that I became the chief minister, I am not because I know the pain of heading a coalition government and running it despite pulls and pressures from all sides,\" he said. Assuring the pubic of fulfilling their expectations despite feeling the pain, the chief minister said he had the responsibility of running the government. \"I can't give the reason behind my pain now, as am responsible to run the state well and ensure the officials has the confidence in running the government,\" said Kumaraswamy.

He came half an hour late to inaugurate the operation theatre block. The plight of hundreds of patients and their caretakers was no different as they were stopped at the gate until the CM arrived at 11am, completed the formalities and left the premises around 12.30pm.Most patients were caught unawares as there was no public notice on the event and strict restrictions on public and vehicle movement. The hour-long VIP visit triggered chaos on the road too: several commuters were stuck on stretches surrounding the venue as vehicles piled up due to restrictions on traffic movement. Worse, ambulances too were stopped by traffic cops to allow the CM\u2019s convoy to pass through.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

This World Music Day, we got eight musicians from the city, from varied genres and age groups, to discuss the fuel that keeps Bengaluru running \u2014 music, at the soon-to-be-launched Indian Music Experience museum in the city. From explaining the inclusive ethos of Bengaluru for audiophiles to suggestions to bring in a more holistic approach towards music, the eight musicians discussed many things. Excerpts from the chat\u2026 Dr Suma SudhindraBengaluru\u2019s \u2018music\u2019 USP: Nowhere else in India have I seen this happen. From classical to folk to contemporary, new experiments here are always welcome. Bengaluru has a very good receptive audience. How can Bengaluru cultivate a better music culture: We need smaller venues for intimate shows. All shows in Bengaluru need to be ticketed, you pay for a movie so you can pay for concerts too. We need musicians to play in more venues across the city, as traffic deters audience. Manasi PrasadBengaluru\u2019s \u2018music\u2019 USP: Bengaluru has a good mix of artistes, audience and venues. Having lived across Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru, I can confidently say today, that if you\u2019re a musician, classical or contemporary, this city the place to be. How can Bengaluru cultivate a better music culture: While I said the venues are there, the number of venues and the quality of venues needs to improve. We can do better in terms of acoustics and size. 00:54Bengaluru musicians get together for World Music DayShalini MohanBengaluru\u2019s \u2018music\u2019 USP: Bengalureans represent the whole of India because people from all parts of the country live here. Musicians have the opportunity to cater to this cultural diversity. How can Bengaluru cultivate a better music culture: The onus is on both artistes and the people who build and nurture venues for performances. When venues tend to play safe by booking just tribute-based performances, they do not encourage local original bands. Artistes too need to ensure they play to entertain those who are paying for their tickets. Bindu SubramaniamBengaluru\u2019s \u2018music\u2019 USP: Apart from the fact that the audience in this city is open-minded, the musicians in Bengaluru are also open-minded. So you get to see collaborations like nowhere else. How can Bengaluru cultivate a better music culture: Here, we need access to a higher quality of education in music for children. This will build the next generation of musicians, as well as open-minded listeners. Prakash SontakkeBengaluru\u2019s \u2018music\u2019 USP: Back in history, the Mysuru Palace was the place that encouraged performances and promoted all sorts of music. The Indian classical violin, for instance, was invented there. Mysuru was where it all began. Today, Bengaluru is that Mysuru. There is an audience for everyone. How can Bengaluru cultivate a better music culture: With Bengaluru developing along with metros, it would be perfect to have accessible venues along or close to the metro line. This way, people can hop from one concert to another. Keeping places closer to public transport access points ensures greater awareness of and participation at performances and concerts. Dheerendra DossBengaluru\u2019s \u2018music\u2019 USP: Music is intrinsic to the genes of native Bengalureans. We understand our classical music and yet have our knowledge of classic rock. This is what defines the city. How can Bengaluru cultivate a better music culture: The venues in the city need to up their game, they need to create the hype. This is the only way they will get more audience, as the audience today are spoilt for choice. We need to revive properties like Sunday Jam. Khalid AhamedBengaluru\u2019s \u2018music\u2019 USP: Our city is multi-cultural destination. I come from Kashmir and when we started playing Sufi music here, we had people coming in specifically to listen to our kind of music. The openness to new things and new experiences makes this city the best place to be. How can Bengaluru cultivate a better music culture: Coming from the indie scene, I see so many young talented bands here. People enjoy a great performance too, but I do not understand the concept of trying to be on the \u2018guest list\u2019. We need to respect musicians and the arts. Brodha VBengaluru\u2019s \u2018music\u2019 USP: Bengaluru has a very calm vibe to it. It is away from the rat race where everyone is trying to make commercial music. It allows everyone to be and do whatever they want to do. How can Bengaluru cultivate a better music culture: We have all that we need to cultivate good music.

When sold in Hindi-speaking areas, they'll be in Hindi and Kannada.\"  For products sold globally, KSDL will use English as the primary language along with the local language of that nation. \"Introducing Kannada for the export market has not yet been considered,\" said Kumar.  Also, the 103-year-old company will use photographs of Mysore Sandal Soap creators - Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar and his diwan Sir M Visvesvaraya - on all products sold worldwide. Board\u2019s nod awaitedThe state government has given its concurrence for using their photographs and the KSDL board\u2019s approval is awaited. The idea to promote the founders came after a spike in demand for its sandal incense sticks. \u201cWe initially mooted branding of our sandal incense sticks as \u2018MV 100 sticks\u2019 in recognition of Sir M Visvesvaraya\u2019s contribution. Soon after the meeting with KDA a few months ago, we decided to acknowledge Wadiyar\u2019s contribution in starting the company,\u201d said Kumar. The company\u2019s turnover in 2018-19 is Rs 700 crore with a net profit of Rs 110 crore, while 2019-20, the turnover is estimated to rise to Rs 900 crore with a net profit of Rs 150 crore.

At an event in Bengaluru on Thursday, where she shared the dais with chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, Murthy addressed him directly and sought permission to carry out the project. Read Also: Why brides say no to youths from Kumta villageResponding to the report, the CM directed the deputy commissioner of Uttara Kannada district, Harish Kumar K, to visit the village to get first-hand information about the plight of its residents. Kumar said he had received a call from the CMO about the report and would visit Medini on Friday. The CM also offered all support to Infosys Foundation for the initiative. TOI had reported that the village of about 400 people was connected to the rest of the state only by an 8km trail from Kumta-Siddapura road to the village, through thick forest, which becomes treacherous during monsoon. With little infrastructure in the remote village, its youths are turned down by prospective brides from elsewhere. The village produces a fragrant rice variety, \u2018Medini akki\u2019, but the lack of road and transport facilities means they cannot sell it in markets in nearby towns. Villagers said they were happy that the deputy commissioner would visit them. \u201cWe are thankful to the CM for his response. We hope to get a good road to connect the village with the rest of the world,\u201d said Shivaram Gouda, a village elder. While campaigning for the assembly polls last year, Kumaraswamy had promised villagers, who met him at Gokarna, that he would visit Medini soon. They were disappointed Medini did not figure in his CM\u2019s Grama Vastavya (village stay) programme. With a road in place now, villagers feel they won\u2019t be lost on a map anymore. \u201cI felt very bad when I read the report on Medini. Chief minister Kumaraswamy must give us permission to build the road,\u201d Sudha Murty said at the event. \u201cMany hesitate to take this initiative because of the difficulty in obtaining such permissions. Kumaraswamy said he will do it, but I have volunteered to do it.\u201d Referring to the plight of women who have to walk 8km for basic facilities, she said, \u201cMy grandfather used to advise me to use the blessings of goddess Lakhmi (money) to aid women who are also referred to as Lakshmi,\u201d said Murty.
