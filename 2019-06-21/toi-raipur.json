Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

Prima facie indicates that the girl might be playing in and around the under construction water tank and would have slipped in the water while the bricks kept on the tank wall would have fallen upon her causing her death, police said. Amid speculations if something unfortunate had happened to the girl before she died, police said that the case would be investigated on all angles based on the reports of autopsy. Her body was sent for autopsy and reports are awaited. The murder angle will also be investigated as there was chance that someone had killed her and threw her body inside the tank and to prevent it from floating in the water, heap of bricks were used. While the mother of girl is fainting in regular intervals, police earlier doubted it to be case of kidnap. The 5- year-old girl at Darrapara had left home around 12 noon on Sunday and she was last seen around 2 with her friend. When she didn\u2019t return till evening, parents started looking for her and had to report the matter to police by late evening. A missing report was lodged based on complaints of her parents. Police had intensified the search and the case was personally being monitored by Raipur range inspector general of police Anand Chabra who went to Gariyaband and had asked officials to check each nook and corner, all closed buildings and homes, river sides and hills. Sniffer dog squad was also pressed into service and all the houses in the region were being checked to verify if any person had kept her confined due to personal rivalry.

However, the police dropped the charges on Friday after chief minister Bhupesh Baghel went public expressing his displeasure for slapping IPC section 124A and vouching that he was all for protecting freedom of expression. The arrest of accused Mangilal Agrawal, who hails from Rajnandgaon, comes at a time when the Congress in its election manifesto to review and amend the law including the contentious IPC section 124A that deals with sedition. Mangilal Agrawal had posted a video on social media platforms strongly criticising the Congress government for frequent interruptions in power supply in Chhattisgarh, which is known as a power surplus state, during this summer. His social media post claimed that interruptions in power supply were deliberate to benefit inverter companies to boost their sales and the power cut is just a ploy to mint money. On the complaint of state power holding company officials, police swung into action late on Thursday and picked him up and slapped charges under 124A for sedition, 505 for statements conducing to public mischief, rumours with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquillity. State power holding company chairman Shailendra Shukla forwarded this video to company legal advisor NKP Singh, who advised that legal action for spreading rumours to tarnish the image of chief minister and power company chairman and to cause alarm to the public that could adversely affect public tranquillity. Later, an FIR was lodged against the accused. However, Power companies chairman Shailendra Shukla told media that power supply is affected due to various factors, including natural causes like strong winds. But some people are spreading false information that these were caused due to some deal with inverter companies which is totally fake. The arrest sparked an outrage on the social media and BJP MP from Rajnandgaon Santosh pandey said while the Congress had promised to repeal the sedition law, the government itself is misusing it to implicate and threaten the common masses. If spreading rumours is such an offence, so far several Congressmen should have been put behind bars, he said. Stung by criticism, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel issued a statement disapproving the police action and asked the Director General of police DM Awasthy to have review and re-investigate the matter. Within hours, police dropped the sedition charges against Mangilal Agrawal against whom the charges of IPC section 505 would remain. Later, Baghel issued a statement saying that he and his government vouched for people\u2019s freedom of expression. \u201cSuch actions were followed as a tradition by the previous BJP governments. We are always for freedom of expression\u201d, he said and appealed to the people to exercise restraint in their expressions. \u201cI have directed those concerned to withdraw seditions charges immediately and to ensure that such actions are not repeated in future\u201d, he said.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

This Ramzan, quite a few families in Raipur turned sehri into an opportunity for get-togethers with family and close friends. People who are fasting gathered after the late-night tarawih namaz for leisurely meals and conversations, until there was no room for another morsel.

In fact, we welcomed anyone who wished to come, underprivileged or uninvited,\u2019\u2019 says Razia. Several families also organised potluck Sehri parties, where people brought different food items, turning the occasion into a grand feast. It\u2019s a great way to celebrate sans stress or expenses.

The first party this year had delectable mutton do pyaza, yakhni pulao, dahi vada, pasta, Russian salad and dates on the menu. \u201cWe all gathered post midnight, and as any gathering in Raipur is incomplete without tea and snacks, we all begin with a hot cuppa,\u201d said Zameer, adding that the festivities went on till they couldn\u2019t eat anymore. Adding to this, homemaker Sana Salim says they planned the menu properly before the gathering so that no dish got repeated. \u201cThe meal was savoured sitting on the floor, surrounded by the dastarkhan. It helps in improving digestion. The constant movement of bending forward to pick up the food and then returning to the sitting position activatess the muscles in the abdomen and secretes digestive juices better,\u201d says Sana.

They have been asked to appear on June 25, the SIT notice said. Raipur SSP Arif Sheikh said that the SIT notice has been issued to four suspects in the case, including Ajit Jogi, Amit Jogi, Puneet Gupta and Manturam Pawar, the Congress candidate who had abruptly withdrawn his name from the by-election. The SIT notice said that an FIR was registered in February regarding the Antagarh tape scam at Pandri police station of Raipur by former mayor Kiranmayee Nayak. Moreover, there is a pen drive with purported recording of telephonic conversations of the alleged accused and voice sampling needs to be done to verify the same. Hence, Jogis, Pawar and Gupta have been asked to appear at cyber control room in Ganj ground on June 25 at 10.30 am. The audio tapes are related to the assembly bypolls in 2014, and allegedly comprise conversations among Ajit Jogi, his son and Gupta over poll fixing.

Reacting to the notice, Amit Jogi said that the notice for collecting voice sample can be taken seriously only after SIT provides me the seized equipment along with the certificate. In absence of these documents, the notice is illegal. Jogi took to the social media to make his reaction viral saying that in case of failing to do so, he will exercise his legal rights and approach the court. Moreover, Jogi said that the police might be aware that I have already moved the high court challenging the legality of the SIT constituted to probe the case and the HC has already issued a direction that no coercive action should be taken in the case. He said that the notice issued to him is in contravention to the HC order and he would move an application in the HC in this regard. The case is registered under section 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), section 420 (cheating and dishonesty) and other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and an SIT was formed to probe the case. Amit Jogi was expelled from Congress soon after the incident came to light. Later, Ajit Jogi resigned from the party and formed a regional party Janata Congress.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users.

He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said.

Police said, Manoj Sachdeva of Fafadih locality in Raipur owns a plastic scientific equipment company - M/s Sachdeva Scientific Equipment Pvt Ltd situated at Baloda Bazaar Road. His factory is in operation since 2014. He hired the accused Haresh Purohit and Girish Purohit as manufacturing head and director soon after. Taking advantage of Sachdeva's faith in them, the accused registered the 'Casablanca' trademark of his company in their own name and ever since then have been supplying manufactured goods in the market under a brand owned by them, minting crores and causing losses to Sachdeva. This is in addition to the Rs13 lakhs. In April, the accused told Sachdeva, that the moulds used for manufacturing various equipment need maintenance and repair, and they sent them to a Mumbai-based firm. On May 2 the accused took the repaired moulds worth Rs13 lakhs from the firm and fled. Sachdeva came to know about the swindle only after a telephonic conversation with the owner of the Mumbai firm. Stunned by the fraudulence of his employees, Sachdeva launched an audit of the accounts of his firm while simultaneously tracing the absconding duo. It is then he found that they had registered his company's trademark under their name. Sachdeva lodged a complaint against them in Kharora police station following which an offence under Section 420,408 IPC was registered against both. A manhunt was launched with the help of Cyber Cell. A few days ago, their location was traced to Kandivali (East) area of Mumbai. A police team was sent to Mumbai and the accused were taken into custody. They have been brought to the city under transit remand.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Baghel shot back that as CM he has to meet people, and if he should make public his discussions with Amit\u2019s mother Renu Jogi as well. Amit Jogi in a series of tweets claimed that chief minister Bhupesh Baghel had a closed door meeting with senior officials of Adani Group during his recent visit to Delhi, urging him to make public the discussions which he had with the Adani Group. Replying to Jogi\u2019s statement, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said \u201cwhosoever the CM meets come out in public and there's no reason to hide.\u201d Baghel added that he had also met Amit's legislator mother Renu Jogi alone as a politician and does he want that the conversation should be made public?

Last week, tribals in Bastar had strongly protested against Adani Group proposed mine developer and operator (MDO) project for extraction of iron ore from deposit number 13 at Bailadila. Subsequently, the state government had put on hold the pre-mining activity, including cutting down of trees, being carried out by joint NCL limited, a joint venture of NMDC and Chhattisgarh Mineral Development corporation.

The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Thousands of tribals are camping out in Kirandul, determined to protect 'jal-jangal-jameen', handing the six-month-old Congress government its biggest challenge yet. At the heart of the protest is Nandaraj Hill, which is marked as Bailadila iron ore deposit No. 13. In September last year, Adani Enterprises incorporated Bailadila Iron Ore Mining Private Ltd as a special purpose vehicle, and successfully bid for mine developer-cum-operator (MOO) for the Bailadila deposit. But villagers rose in protest against deposit No. 13 being given to the private firm, alleging it will bring about \"destruction and deforestation\" in the 315.8-hectare forest patch. Moreover, tribal villagers say, they have a strong religious connection with Nandaraj Hill, where they regularly go to pray. The Adani Group has issued a statement that it believes in 'growth with goodness', but the protesters refuse to budge. They gheraoed the National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) office on Friday, alleging that thousands of trees are already being felled. To make things more difficult for the administration, Maoists of Darbha division have thrown their weight behind the agitation. The rebels have distributed leaflets to support the tribals. Protestors threaten to block highways, railway tracksUnder the banner of \u2018Gramin Panchayat Sangh Samiti\u2019, tribals have started gathering in the thousands in Kirandul. Many of them have travelled all the way from Sukma. People from Hiroli, Benpal, Mudadi, Guniyapal have gathered in large numbers and were seen cooking food on Friday.  Police said they have not taken action so far as it\u2019s a peaceful protest. Security is being tightened even further as police suspect Maoists are egging on the agitation. The protesters have warned that they will begin blocking trains and national highways if mining isn\u2019t stopped. JCC, AAP and CPI leaders are supporting the protesters. Tribal leader Soni Sori and Ajit Jogi might join the protest, say sources. In a statement issued by Adani Group, a company spokesman said, \u201cLocated in South Bastar in Dantewada, Bailadila Iron Ore Deposits (natural resources) are owned by government. It is important to note that central and stateowned NCL owns these mines and Adani Enterprises Ltd only provides the support as an experienced and responsible mining contractor.\u201d  \u201cAdani Group strongly believes in \u2018Growth with Goodness\u2019 and this is evident from the community-oriented initiatives undertaken by its notfor-profit arm, Adani Foundation,\u201d it said. NMDC and state PSU, Chhattisgarh Mineral Development Corporation Ltd (CMDC Ltd), formed a joint venture in 2008 to commence mining, it pointed out, adding that NMDC conducted gram sabhas between 2010 and 2014, got environment clearance in 2015 and forest clearance in January 2017. In 2017, mining lease was transferred to the government-owned joint venture company, NMDC-CMDC Ltd (NCL), the Adani Group statement goes. \u201cIn January 2018, at least 10 companies expressed interest in the international competitive bid for development and operation of Bailadila iron ore deposit No. 13. AEL was selected as successful bidder through transparent reverse bidding. In December 2018, NCL appointed AEL as mining contractor. AEL was not involved in obtaining clearances for the project and only after December 2018 it assumed role of mining contractor through transparent bidding,\u201d it said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

It triggered a storm of criticism, and the charge was revoked on Friday on the orders of chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who told police to ensure that it isn't repeated.  The controversy began with a Rajnandgaon resident, Mangilal Agrawal, posting a video of his on various social media platforms on Wednesday, criticising the Congress government for frequent interruptions in power supply in Chhattisgarh. He alleged that the power cuts were deliberate, as a ploy to boost inverter sales .  The video went viral. State power holding company chairman Shailendra Shukla forwarded it to company legal advisor N K P Singh, who advised legal action. An FIR was filed and Agrawal was arrested on Thursday. He was charged under IPC 124A for sedition and IPC 505 (intent to incite any class or community to commit offence against any other class or community). Both of them are non-bailable . What made the arrest even more controversial was that ahead of Lok Sabha election, Congress had sought votes on its pledge to abolish the British-era law.  The arrest sparked outrage on social media. \"Congress had promised to repeal the sedition law, yet its government is misusing it. If spreading rumours is such a serious offence, then several Congressmen should have been put behind bars by now,\" said BJP MP from Rajnandgaon, Santosh Pandey.  Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel issued a statement, disapproving of the police action. Within hours, police dropped the sedition charge. Baghel said he and his government \"vouch for freedom of expression\".  However, Agrawal is still in custody as he faces charges under IPC 505. \"Power supply is affected due to various factors, including natural causes like strong winds. But some people are spreading false information that it's due to some kind of a 'deal' with inverter companies. This is totally false,\" said power companies' chairman Shailendra Shukla.

The ultras kept on hostage three guards deployed at the godown premises, and breaking the locks of one of the warehouse, they put on fire nearly 1,700 ruck sacks stuffed with tendu leaves . Police said that the incident took place in the village of Nawamguda at the warehouse where the forest produce tendu leaves are stocked up for supply. There are three godowns owned by Forest Department for storing tendu leaves. Tendu leaves are used to wrap tobacco and used as 'beedi'. Police added that more than a dozen armed Maoists appeared fromt eh darkness of forest late on Tuesday around 2330 hours and got hold of the guards on duty. While few of them kept the guards on hostage others went towards one of the three godowns with kerosene oil and match boxes. They broke open the locks and set ablaze 1700 ruck sacks full with tendu leaves. It took minutes for fire to engulf the whole godown and the dry leaves turned into ashes while the premise was gutted. The stock of leaves were worth Rs 9 crore. The rebels escaped the spot and left the guards locked inside a room to prevent them informing police immediately. After efforts of few hours, when the guards came out of the room, they informed fire brigade police and forest official and the spot of incident taken over by the fire department which was further sealed for inquiry. As it is peak of summer, the fire took long to get doused till Wednesday morning. The remaining stock of tendu leaves will be shifted to some other warehouse, police said. The Maoists also have left a leaflet that alleges the villagers who go for collection of tendu leaves in forests were not getting proper and full payment for the work they do, therefore the stock was put on fire. However, the stock belongs to a local contractor who was being questioned by the police. However, police said that efforts were being made to keep Maoists at bay who indulge in extortion of money from contractors for collection of tendu leaves, which is why the rebels were upset and have tried to create terror. The Manpur Naxal Divisional Committee is behind the incident, police said addingt hat searching was on to nab the accused. Subsequently, Gariyaband police successfully recovers a huge cache of arms and ammunition at a Maoist camp in forest. Based on input about presence of Maoists in the region, a team of district police went on an anti-Maoist operation in forests of Manpur on the mountains of Tarjhaar when they spotted a bunker of Maoists which had huge cache of arms and ammunition including an indigenous rocket launcher. Police said that two muzzle loading guns, one air gun, one country revolver, five gelatin wire, 12 bore rifle, eight live bombs and equipment to make weapons along with explosives were recovered from the spot. This shows that Maoists were present on the spot few moments ago and they might have escaped on being informed by local villagers about police approaching their camp, a police official said.
