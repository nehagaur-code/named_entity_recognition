Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

The manufacturers and traders claimed that a growth of up to 25% was noticed in production and sale of sewain during Ramzan this year as the production units worked with full capacity due to better power supply. On the eve of the festival of Eid-ul-Fitr shops selling superfine quality Banarasi kimami sewain (vermicelli), especially in Dalmandi market, remained flooded for all day long. If the sewain sellers are to be believed there was high demand for ghee-fried soot pheni for sehri during the holy month of Ramzan. When TOI contacted general secretary of Varanasi Sewai Grihudyog Vyavsyaik Sangh, Sacchelal Agrahari, he said, \u201cProduction of sewain industry for Ramzan and Eid remains above 1,000 tonne every year in the city to cater to the need of local markets as well as across the country and export. This year the demand from all the markets remained high up to 25% as compared to previous years and we produced sewain and soot-pheni accordingly.\u201d Irshad, one of the prominent sellers of sewain in Dalmandi market, also admitted a boom in sale this time. For the special Banarasi sewain, traders and exporters depend on Bhadau, an area surrounded by several Muslim dominated localities, the biggest hub of the world famous Banarasi Sewain manufacturing in past four-five decades. A group of about 40 Hindu and few Muslim families live here. This area caters to the demand of domestic market as well as for export to other countries through traders based in Delhi and other major cities. Agrahari, whose three generations have been into sewain production, recalls how it started as a home-based trade in Bhadaun decades ago. \u201cMy grandfather started sewain production by preparing thin strands with hands. Soon, neighbours and relatives residing nearby also learnt the art. After a few years, manual machines were installed in many households for sewain production. With time, modern machines operated by electricity took over and at present each of 50 families including two Muslim families have a machine installed at their place to churn out sewain,\u201d he said. Manufacturers in this locality said that while the normal size sewain are prepared at many places in the country, thin sewain of various sizes, including size 1, size 2, size 0 and size 00 are prepared only in the holy city. Interestingly, the delicacies are prepared from special refined flour, while pure ghee gives it its special texture. \u201cFine quality \u2018Kimami\u2019 sewain (raw and white) are in high demand for Eid festivities while thicker and ghee-fried soot-pheni are cherished for Sehri during Ramzan,\u201d they said. Another sewain manufacturer and wholesaler, Rajendra Kumar said, \u201cSewain preparations starts immediately after Holi and continues till June and July. About two-and-a-half quintal of fine quality Kimami sewain is produced at a time in a machine while about three-and-a-half quintal of thick Laccha sewain is produced at a time.\u201d Abdul Hameed, a wholesaler from Chandauli district, was in the city to purchase Kimami sewain. He said, \u201cBanarasi sewain stands out from all other types of sewain due to its fine quality due to which there is a huge demand for it from across the country as well as abroad.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Weight Loss": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/weight-loss/weight-loss-read-how-an-embarrassing-mall-trip-made-this-dj-lose-32-kilos-in-6-months/articleshow/69877041.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Yoga Day Wishes": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/happy-international-yoga-day-2019-wishes-messages-quotes-images-facebook-whatsapp-status/articleshow/69875845.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Mamata Banerjee": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/news/who-is-modi-to-ask-about-our-pm-candidate/articleshow/68661875.cms", "time": "", "description": "VISAKHAPATNAM: Projecting TDP supremo and AP chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu as a \u201cnational leader of importance\u201d and keeping the debate on the alternate front prospects in the ensuing elections alive, West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee appealed to people of AP to elect TDP again to keep the duo of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah away from power. \u201cWho is Modi to ask about our Prime Minister candidate?

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Under the Namami Gange programme, two STPs of 120 mld were recently completed at Dinapur and Goithaha in Varanasi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated the Dinapur STP in November 2018. During the inspection of 140 mld Dinapur STP, he directed the officials, including director general, National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, to ensure a complete check on industrial and other toxic discharge into the river.

He also reviewed the regular cleaning project of all the 84 ghats as well as the river surface and work of ghat pumping stations and tapping of drains.

The locals, who were agitated over the incident, reportedly made an abortive attempt to damage the house of the suspect at nearby Asawan village dominated by people belonging to minority community. The situation was, however, brought under control due to the intervention of the panchayat mukhiya, who informed the senior police officials about the incident around 2 am on Wednesday. \u201cWe have deployed additional police force in the area as a precautionary measure. Patrolling has been intensified and the locals have been warned of stern action for taking law into their hands,\u201d Bhagwanpur SHO said, adding that prima facie the incident appeared to be a fall out of love affair. Kaimur SP Dilnawaz Ahmad said that the accused involved in abetting the girl for taking the extreme step wouldn\u2019t be spared. The victim\u2019s viscera has also been preserved.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

Varanasi, also called Banaras and Kashi, is the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Not only does the station building make the railway station class apart, but also all its various passenger-friendly amenities. The new facilities provided by Indian Railways include LED lights, an air-conditioned waiting lounge and stainless steel benches. According to the reports, the Modi government plans to rename the revamped Manduadih station as 'Banaras' railway station. Fountains have been set up to beautify the areas which now have a spacious waiting area, circulating area, booking/reservation office, cafeteria, food court, waiting rooms and more.  The station also has AC and non-AC retiring rooms as well as dormitories. The architecture in the station premises reflects the spirit of Kashi. The platforms are clean and shining with LED lights and LCD display panels. The premises are well lit with LED lights and cleanliness is top-notch. This station will not only provide world-class international standard facility to the passengers but, it will also offer employment to Varanasi citizens. The Manduadih railway station has eight platforms and currently, eight trains originate from the station. Former Union Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha had written to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath requesting him to consider the renaming of the Manduadih Railway Station. \"The name Manduadih does not sound good and does not connect with the legacy of Banaras,\" a top railway official of Varanasi division was quoted as saying. The matter, however, did not reach its logical conclusion since elections were announced shortly after the new railway station was completed. Soon after Narendra Modi-led NDA came to power, the historic city of Varanasi has come alive as massive development projects have been sanctioned to re-develop Kashi or Varanasi, one of the most important religious and revered sites for Hindus.

Getting late to workplace due to traffic snarls? Take a ropeway. Varanasi could soon be one of the first few cities in India to get a web of cable car networks to beat congestion on streets. The cable car network based on ropeway system in PM Narendra Modi\u2019s constituency is estimated to be 70% cheaper than Metro rail network.The state government has junked the Metro rail proposal and instead has decided to go in for the system in the temple town. This proposal of ropeway system at advance stage is being seen as a move to help commuters get the better of Kashi\u2019s winding bylanes and a complex traffic profile \u2014 from meandering bulls and rickshaws to SUVs and buses. Sources said if the government gives the go ahead, cable cars moving in all directions would be a reality in less than two years. Till now cable cars are limited to tourist destinations in India unlike some of the western cities where it\u2019s a mode of daily commuting. Doppelmayr, an Austrian company which has put cable cars in a few cities including the most acclaimed project in La Paz in Bolivia, has made the proposal to put the cable car system in the city. Vikram Singhal, managing director of its India operations told TOI, \u201cA feasibility report by RITES was presented to the local authority. The frequency of cable cars will be in every few seconds and hence there will be almost no waiting time for commuters. We plan to put the system across the city and not on a few stretches.\u201d Ropeway can ferry 12,000 people an hour\u2019He added that the company is in dialogue with city administrations in Dehradun, Vishakhapatnam and Kanpur to put this system to beat congestion. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had suggested cities and towns in hills to explore cable car system for better connectivity. Varanasi Development Authority (VDA) chairman Deepak Agrawal said, \u201cRITES has been asked to prepare a comprehensive mobility plan by integrating ropeways with mini-metro (monorail), bus rapid transport system and waterways in view of city\u2019s topography. It will make another presentation before officials and stakeholders on June 25 after which the DPR will be forwarded to the Centre for a final nod.\u201d The presentation will give a clear picture on the possible routes. Apart from densely populated areas, RITES will explore the possibility of introducing cable cars along the 11km Varuna Corridor by integrating a 7km stretch of River Varuna, which can used for water transport. In February 2018, the VDA had consulted Austrian companies in the wake of the success of cable car travel in old cities of Europe and other continents. The companies had conveyed to VDA that a ropeway system required no major ground coverage, as elevated stations were feasible in congested areas too. They said up to 80 passengers could be accommodated in one cable car and it was possible to ferry 12,000 people an hour.

This was the second time in a gap of 10 days, when the mercury crossed the 46 degree mark. On May 30, the maximum temperature soared to 46.1 degrees Celsius. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum temperature in the city stood at 46.4 degrees Celsius, seven notches above normal. The minimum temperature was also registered two notches above normal at 29.5 degrees Celsius, making life miserable for the people. Unrelenting heat wave added to the discomfort of the people and experts have claimed there would not be any respite from the blistering heat in coming days. Markets are wearing a deserted look with people preferring to remain indoors fearing sunstroke. Health experts have advised people to stay indoors during peak heat hours (12 noon to 3pm) to avoid sun stroke and take plenty of fluids like aam panna and fruit juices to stay hydrated. The weather department has forecast no respite from heat wave in the coming week as the mercury will keep vovering around 45 degrees Celsius. Hot and humid conditions will persist in evening and night. In the past 10 years, the mercury has touched or crossed the 46 degree mark five times. On June 7, 2014, the maximum temperature was recorded as 46.7 degrees Celsius, while 46.5 degrees Celsius and 46.4 degrees Celsius was recorded on June 4, 2017 and June 9, 2015. All-time record of maximum temperature in Varanasi was 48 degrees Celsius on June 9, 1966. The weather department said the water-laden winds may lag further and reach Uttar Pradesh 8-10 days late and arrive in June last week. State Met officials said normal dates of monsoon arrival in UP and its capital are June 15 and June 18, respectively, but since it has hit Kerala eight days late, it would arrive in UP between June 23 and 25 if its advancement continues at normal speed. It will hit east UP first and cover Varanasi by June 24-26, Allahabad by June 27-28 and Lucknow only by June 28-29, the officials added.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai.

A case was registered against Rai at Lanka police station in Varanasi on May 2 on the complaint of a Ballia girl under sections 376 (rape), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of IPC. \u201cRai was declared an absconder by Lanka police on May 20,\u201d said Lanka inspector Bharat Bhushan. Following the FIR, Rai absconded after leaving the responsibility of his poll campaign on his wife Priyanka Rai and brother Pavan Rai. He then tried to get a stay against his arrest from Allahabad High Court and Supreme Court. However, on rejection of his pleas, he presented a surrender application in Varanasi court on May 17. Even though he is on the run, Rai succeeded in defeating BJP candidate Harinarain Rajbhar from Ghosi parliamentary constituency.

Imarti\u2019s wife was arrested after lodging of an FIR by the Cantt police. SP city Dinesh Kumar Singh said that Imarti is being suspended while police teams have been engaged to arrest him and his two sons in this connection. Police also asked food safety and drug administration officials to carry out a drive in Pandeypur and adjoining areas to detect how many illegal water plants are operating. On Sunday morning Srivastava raided Pandeypur area. Initially he entered the house of an electricity department employee, who was also found running water plant to prepare packaged water for selling in retail market. It is alleged that Srivastava avoided initiating any action against the owner of the unit. Later, he raided the neighbouring house of Imarti where on detection of similar water plant and packaging unit he allegedly threatened to initiate legal action. SP City said that during initial investigation of police it surfaced that following exchange of heated words between Srivastava and Imarti the latter attacked the inspector with his family members. Later, more supporters of Imarti joined him in attacking Srivastava, who somehow managed to escape. Later, he reached Cantt police station after which he was taken to hospital for medical examination. Following these developments SP City along with heavy police force raided incident site and carried out a massive checking drive after it was found that illegal water plants were being run in many houses. Upon noticing it he asked FSDA officials to carry out a massive drive as refilling of used bottles of branded packaged water was also suspected there.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan.

The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

With dozens of applications daily in the handful of moksha bhavans, the wait list can run into several years. But all that\u2019s set to change. A new site for salvation that's coming up will be both \"more sacred\" and have enough rooms to make the wait shorter. As part of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) project, a government-funded moksha bhavan is being built, with equal number of rooms for men and women, that will accommodate about 50 people. Chief executive officer of Kashi Vishwanath Temple Vishal Singh told TOI that while one of the existing moksha centres in Kashi only allows couples, the other is for those on their deathbed. The latest moksha bhavan will have no such riders. But what truly renders the new centre different from existing ones is the fact that it will come up in the most sacred part of Kashi \u2014 the Avimukt circle that falls between the Kashi Vishwanath temple and Manikarnika Ghat. The three-storied building will also house a hospital and accommodation would be provided on first come first serve basis. \u201cTo develop the hospice at the most sacred site, the building of an ashram \u2014 Vriddha Sant Seva Ashram \u2014 has been purchased for Rs 2.5 crore,\u201d Singh said.

A controversial figure, Rai was reinstated in women welfare department in 2016 after spending 14 years in jail in a case of murder. District magistrate (DM) Surendra Singh has, meanwhile, attached Rai to the Government women\u2019s old age home, Durgakund, and also recommended suspension and disciplinary action against him in a letter sent to the principal secretary, women welfare department, stating that his acts were violative of the Juvenile Justice Act as well as service rules. The DM said that after collecting video clips in which mentally challenged children could be seen cleaning toilets and kneading flour in the kitchen of the home on June 10, district probation officer Pravin Kumar Tripathi raided the place the same night. During investigation, the officer recorded the statement of the inmates and the staff. The children told the probation officer that Rai often forced them to clean the toilet. In his report submitted to the DM, the probation officer claimed that Rai, who has created a lobby with the help of some service providers of the home, uploaded the video on social media in a bid to malign the image of the home. The probation officer also reported that Rai had a criminal background and was in jail for 14 years on charge of murder. After his release, he managed to get himself reinstated in the department and was posted at the Government children\u2019s home (boys), Ramnagar in 2016, he added.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.
