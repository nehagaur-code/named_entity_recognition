Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Rajasthan Engineering Admission Process(REAP) are upbeat over the responses in the ongoing admission process. Last year, for around 40,000 seats, less than 15,000 applications were received. Till June 7, the body has received 7000 applications against the figure of 2000 last year in the first seven days of the admission process. As per experts, one of the reasons for less number of applicants last year was lower awareness among students regarding the examination and its benefits. This year, officials said that they have been promoting the examination by advertising on radio, television, newspapers and even sent officials to promote it within government school students. Sandeep Kumar, convener of the REAP, 2019 examination, said, \u201cLast date of filling the form is June 29. Till June 7, we have already received 7,000 applications and the number is increasing every day. This is really a positive sign as last year by this date only 2,000 forms were received.\u201d Due to the low turnout of students, government has been attempting various methods to attract more students. In 2017, one of the reasons for less number of applicants was the condition to deposit of advance amount of Rs 10,000 (refundable) along with the form fees of Rs 700. However, this was changed in 2018 and students were able to directly apply by depositing form fees. Earlier, exam was conducted for selection but now candidates are selected on the basis of JEE Mains and Advance rank An institute round is also conducted for any remaining seats where students can directly apply to the college of their choice. An official on condition of anonymity said that less number of students are opting for engineering because of low rate of placements in the field. \u201cIn Rajasthan, students opt for civil, electrical and mechanical engineering due to the scope available in government jobs. In other branches of engineering, placements are not as good as most companies prefer to hire engineers from Bangalore and there is no mechanism to hire graduates from Rajasthan colleges,\u201d said the official. For mechanical engineering, equipment is costlier than other streams, hence, investment in infrastructure is poor. Punneet Sharma, an academician said that this year the trend is shifting and serious students are opting for Computer Science and Information technology due to the new developments in Artificial Intelligence.

The accused was arrested and video recovered from him on Thursday, while search is on for his accomplice. Deputy superintendent of police, Suresh Kumar Sanwariya is investigating the case. The 25-year-old married woman had gone to a gas agency for free LPG connection under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana on March 12 this year.

Mukesh said that one of his acquaintances runs an E-mitra centre in Kuchaman and took the woman there. Mukesh and Kishore took the woman to a house in Kuchaman and said that their friend is coming with the thumb impression machine. Kishore then went to the fridge and brought something to drink and offered it to the woman. The woman soon fell unconscious and they both raped her, says the FIR.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "BSP List 2019 UP": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/lok-sabha-elections-2019-bsp-releases-first-list-of-11-candidates/articleshow/68522558.cms", "time": "", "description": "LUCKNOW: The BSP on Friday announced its first list of 11 candidates for the Lok Sabha elections 2019, fielding JD(S) turncoat Kunwar Danish Ali from Amroha.

So, the only way to find the Jewish cemetery in the city is to ask for the Christian graveyard. \u201cNo one from the community exists anymore. Once the population of Jews was around 150-200. But most of them migrated to Israel or other parts of India seeking better opportunities,\u201d says Ratan Bennett holding onto the rusted gate of the Jewish cemetery with a \u2018Star of David\u2019 on it. Ratan Bennett (70) is the only person in the city with a Jewish heritage. Born as Abbey Gail Jared in Abu city, she was a Jew before converting to Christianity after her marriage. With only eight graves, the Jewish cemetery has no boundary wall. The land surrounding the cemetery is full of wild plants and thorny bushes. The epitaphs are in Hebrew and English and only state the name and date of death of the person. The oldest grave dates back to 1904. \u201cAbu Road was one of the biggest railway junctions in the British era. Jews, have always been an educated community who settled here to work in the railways. Earlier, the boundaries of this cemetery were intact. Some graves used to have beautiful statues of a woman reading from the Torah (Jewish religious scripture) but slowly due to encroachment and neglect it is now in a dilapidated condition. Around 40 years back, my uncle was the last Jew in the city who migrated to Israel,\u201d recalled Ratan. Ratan\u2019s maternal grandfather who was a guard in railways is buried at the Abu Road cemetery and her paternal grandfather is buried at another Jewish cemetery in Ajmer. These are the only two places to have Jewish cemeteries in Rajasthan. Like on Abu Road, Jews settled in Ajmer were also in the railways. Once a flourishing community, now there are no more Jews left in Rajasthan. As per the 2001 census, one Jew was recorded to be living but no one knows his whereabouts. Migration towards Israel started after its formation in 1948. As per Hansey Timoty (42), a Christian, who is the fourth generation of his family taking care of the Jewish cemetery in Ajmer, the last person buried there was in 1962. \u201cThis is the grave of a six-year-old girl who died in an accident. Her father was in railways before migrating to Israel in 1965. Since then, some of her relatives and others have come to pay a visit once in a while. Otherwise, even the municipal authorities of Ajmer have no clue about this place,\u201d said Hansey. Like Abu Road, Ajmer Jewish cemetery is bordering with the CNI Church Christian Graveyard at Christian Ganj. Built around the same time as Abu Road cemetery, the Ajmer Jewish cemetery has 46 graves and is in shambles with no one to look after it. At its peak, Jews were 250\u2013300 in number before migrating to Israel. At present, both the cemeteries are looked after by the Jewish community settled in Ahmedabad. Joint secretary of the Magen Abraham Synagogue (Jewish place of worship) Jacob Robin Srigawkar while talking to TOI expressed concern about the fate of two cemeteries.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

A drop of almost five degrees Celsius on an average was reported across the state on Thursday. However, Churu and Sriganganagar were the hottest places with a maximum temperature of 44.5 degrees Celsius. Attributing the rainfall and dust storm to the active northerly winds and upper air cyclonic circulation, the Jaipur Met office said that similar conditions will continue in the state for the next couple of days. The ongoing rain spell in the state has also become a catalyst for the increased humidity levels which are conducive for monsoon rain. People in Jaipur witnessed a warmer morning as a minimum temperature of 28.2 degrees Celsius was recorded in the city. It was followed by a cloudy and pleasant afternoon as a maximum temperature of 36.3 degrees Celsius was recorded. For the first time in the season, the city recorded maximum temperature below 40 degrees. Farmers in the city outskirts were elated as rainfall prior to the monsoon is always considered a blessing for sowing seeds. Some places in the city witnessed scattered rainfall which also guided the mercury to take a dip. The ongoing rain spell has increased the humidity upto 72 percent. The Jaipur Met office, however, denied that the spell was related to cyclone Vayu. Many places in the state received rainfall varying from 70mm to 10mm. Mount Abu (Sirohi) received 70 mm rain, the highest in the state on Thursday. Churu and Sriganganagar were followed by Bikaner where a maximum temperature of 43.1 degrees Celsius was recorded, Jaisalmer 41.2, Kota 39.5, Barmer 38.9, Jodhpur 37.6, Jaipur 36.3, Udaipur 34.5 and a maximum temperature of 33 degrees Celsius was recorded in Ajmer.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Another local, Satish Sharma told TOI, \u201cThere are two water tanks and three tube wells for close to 5,000 villagers but they are empty or dried up. Water pipes are broken, and no authority takes the pains to repair them in spite of the fact that we have complained many times.\u201d When there is no water supply, the villagers resort to buying water from the tankers or walking to the closest village which has a functional tube well.

At present, the dam is supplying 395 MLD of water to Jaipur, against the demand of 600 MLD. To continue the supply till July, there are possibilities of deduction of supply in coming days. Bisalpur Dam can produce water only up to 300.5 metres and the water below that is not potable, thus cannot be used for supply. PHED reduced the supply even to Ajmer district where the average demand of water is 350 MLD, but it is able to supply only 250 MLD. On Saturday, for the first time, the level of water went down to 306.96 metres and officials are trying to retain water level till July and are expecting the monsoon to set in in the region by last week of June. On Wednesday, the water level in the dam was 307.2 metres, but it has come down to being lower than 307 metres in the last three days. \u201cFor next 50 days, it\u2019s going to be tough, as because of the heat, the demand is increasing by the day, while the supply is being decreased to retain water till July,\u201d said an official source. He added that now, management is the only way to continue the water supply, mostly in Jaipur and in Ajmer, but people have to sacrifice and limit their water consumption. \u201cAt present, 1.5 crore litres of water is reduced to Ajmer and that has created a crisis, mostly in the rural region,\u201d added the source. Official sources said that the pre-planned deduction in water supply is to save the skin of the department, because reduction in supply of water from Bisalpur was started from September 1, 2018 and now, department claimed 48 hours\u2019 supply in Jaipur, and 72 hours\u2019 water supply in Ajmer city region, but that varies with distribution system. \u201cThe level of water in the dam is decreasing by two centimetre per day, because the catchment area of water is reduced,\u201d said a technical source of the dam. But in reality, there is a water crisis in Ajmer and people are getting only 15 to 20 litres of water in three to four days. People of Nagphani, Ambedkar Colony and nearby regions staged a protest at the office of senior executive engineer of Ajmer and broke an earthen pot in front of the office to register their protest. The supply in Vaishali Nagar and Foy Sagar has also been curbed and people are forced to purchase water tankers. Condition of the rural regions is also getting worse as hand-pumps and wells have already dried up and farmers are worried about availability of water for cattle, mostly in Pisangan region.

Not only his health was spiralling out of control, but also he had to face embarrassment due to his obesity in social gatherings. Weighing 190 kg, Jaiswal is one of the heaviest persons of Ajmer who underwent surgery to reduce his weight. Saturday was the first day he spent at his house after returning from Jaipur\u2019s private hospital where he underwent the surgery. \u201cI hope that everything will be fine now. They (doctors) told me that in six to eight months, my weight will be reduced significantly,\u201d said Jaiswal. Jaiswal works as a storekeeper of kitchen at a private college. His obesity had prevented him from getting socialised. \u201cI started feeling bad about my weight. I started avoiding going to attend marriages in relatives and other such functions. My college administration helped me financially in getting the surgery done,\u201d said Jaiswal. Sedentary lifestyle of Jaiswal has completely changed his life in 16 years. \u201cHe came to hospital with complications in the form of gastroesophageal reflux disease, severe gastritis, joint pain pedal edema swelling in the leg leading to ulcerations on leg, obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, low back pain, inability to do his routine work normally. He had complications of morbid obesity in the form of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease,\u201d said Dr Ajay Sharma, gastrointestinal and laparoscopic bariatric surgeon of a private hospital. Sharma said, \u201cThis is one of the heaviest man operated at Jaipur till date. We have done mini gastric bypass surgery and his weight is expected to decrease by 50 kg is at the end of six months so at the end of six months he would be around 150 kg and by the end of two years he should be around 100 to 125 kg,\u201d said Dr Sharma. Most of his complications of obesity would resolve by the end of two months from now. Hospital director Dr Suhasini informed about the operation being done at the hospital. Gastrointestinal surgeons claimed that elderly obese patients are also opting for surgery to reduce weight. \u201cAged 72, Jannat Bano's health was deteriorating. Her weight, which had seesawed up and down for years, had started piling on along with increasing medical issues. Diagnosed with diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure, Jannat was taking a handful of pills every day. She was 120 kg, when we conducted bariatric surgery last week,\u201d said Dr Sanjay Singhal, bariatric surgeons of a private hospital. She tried many diets, exercise classes and ways of preparing foods. She\u2019d stick with them for a while, then return to old habits. \u201cJannat's condition was similar to that of the one-third of all Indians who are obese or morbidly obese due to sedentary lifestyle. She was more than 100 pounds\u2019 overweight, had a family history of diabetes, and was unable to maintain a healthy weight with diet and exercise,\u201d said Dr Singhal.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.
