The children\u2019s ICU, which will provide a more sanitized ambience for critical care and a lesser risk of infections, has been set up in the first floor of the old CT scan building. It is equipped with 16 beds, each of which can be remotely operated and offer five different positions. \u201cThis will make children more comfortable while they are being made to undergo various procedures, like tube feeding, inserting a ventilator among others. Each bed has also been equipped with oxygen, suction facilities and equipment to monitor vitals,\u201d GH dean Dr B Ashokan said. Earlier the children\u2019s ICU was functioning in a portion of the pediatric surgical unit. Children above the age of one usually require intensive care if they suffer from a severe infection that has progressed to septicemia, severe asthmatic attacks or generally any infection that affects their respiratory tract. \u201cSince children\u2019s trachea and bronchi are very tiny, severe infections like encephalitis or the flu immediately leads to breathing and oxygen intake issues, which sometimes need oxygen or ventilator,\u201d the dean said. The hospital serves children from at least four nearby districts. They come with different types of severe infections, which progresses to septicemia before they are referred to us, the dean said. Private hospitals charge Rs 20,000 a day for the same facilities, while in GH its free, he said. The space for the ward was handed over to Rotary Club of Satellite, who roped in two private firms\u2014Aquasub and Jewel one\u2014 and raised Rs 1.2 crore. They built the ward and handed it over back to GH.

The students were constantly monitored to ensure that they do not drop out again,\u201d said M Thangavel, director of the organization. Compared to girls in rural areas, it is the boys, who are often forced to quit schools. More than 65% of the dropouts from the blocks were boys, Thangavel said. \u201cTo understand the reasons behind it, we conducted a study in the blocks. We chose the blocks as several child marriages were reported from there. Child labour was also rampant at these three places.\u201d \u201cWe had selected 20 villages in Nambiyur block and started children resource centres (CRC) in each village to assist the children two years ago. Apart from guiding them through their academic syllabus, other assistance like counselling and life skill guidance were given to them. In the last two years, no child marriage, no child labour and no school dropouts were reported from those villages,\u201d Thangavel said. The NGO has now identified 60 villages to launch the CRCs. \u201cThe main reason for dropout among boys is the poor financial situation in their families. After a certain age, they would be encouraged to work rather than study. Initially, it took us a lot of time to convince the parents, but eventually they accepted and started sending their children to schools. Now, many of the them are in colleges,\u201d said S Vidhya, a facilitator from Ekalikovilmedu village in Nambiyur block.

They said the population of native cattle breeds, specifically the Malai Kongu Maadu, had dropped drastically after farmers were banned from grazing their cattle in reserve forest zones. They also demanded that the price at which Aavin buys A2 milk from farmers be raised to encourage more farmers to breed and maintain native cow breeds. Farmers, led by the Kongu Patteeshwaran Ghoshala, have requested the collector to make the forest department again issue \u201cpatti passes\u201d to cattle farmers. \u201cThis is a pass that the forest department was issuing to allow us to graze our cattle in forest areas and lands. Around 2000-01, there were nearly 1.5 lakh to two lakh Malai Kongu cows in villages in and around Thondamuthur including Madhampatti, Karadimadai and Viraliyur,\u201d said T Shanmugam a member of the Ghoshala. \u201cHowever, in 2002, when the forest department withdrew our patti passes and banned our and our cattle\u2019s entry into forest areas, many farmers panicked and sold thousands of their native cows to slaughterhouses. We hardly have a few thousand cows of the native breed left,\u201d he said. The farmers said the government should incentivise rearing of native breeds of cattle. \u201cWhile one way is to allow us to graze in forest areas, the other one is to make Aavin buy A2 milk from farmers for at least Rs 50 to Rs 60 per litre. They currently buy it for Rs 20 per litre, which is the cost for A1 milk. They have only one category called milk,\u201d said Shanmugam. \u201cThey should also ban construction on hill area conservation lands and foothills of mountains, because it eventually takes away greenery and open lands which can be used for grazing,\u201d he added. The cattle farmers said that the ban on cattle has affected their environment in multiple ways. \u201cWhenever our cattle used to graze in the forest fringes, wild animals never came out of the forest. We have never seen wild elephants, bears and leopards. Now they have begun coming to our villages,\u201d the petition said. \u201cThe cow\u2019s urine and dung were so beneficial to the soil that the forests were thicker and they used to eat grass so well, that fresh grass kept growing. Now we have less greenery and temperature is higher. We have also had to start using chemical pesticides, because we don\u2019t have enough cow urine to make biopesticides,\u201d it said.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The corporation took the stern action after issuing several eviction notices and holding talks with the residents many a times to vacate their houses in the past two years. Town planning officer (TPO) S Ravichandran said, \u201cThere are 252 houses at Jeeva Nagar. We issued eviction notice to all the houses shortly after the Madras high court gave a direction in 2017. Over a period, 132 families moved to the houses provided by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board at Keeranatham.\u201d As the rest of the residents were refusing to vacate their houses and move to alternative accommodation, the corporation suspended the electricity connection, he said. The corporation had earlier demolished the houses of 90 families who had moved to Keeranatham. The high court gave the direction to remove the encroachments based on a writ petition filed by members of KK Pudur Residents Welfare Association. The petitioners contented that the 50-feet link road, which is a part of designated cart road, for over a kilometre stretch is encroached and none of the emergency service vehicles, including ambulance and fire service vehicles, could enter the street because of the encroachment. The legal battle had commenced as early as 2000. \u201cIf the encroachments are removed and the road is developed, it would significantly reduce the traffic congestion in both NSR Road and Kavundampalayam Road in the city as it connects Thadagam Road and Mettupalayam Road,\u201d secretary of the association KKM Selvaraj, who had filed a writ petition demanding the removal of encroachments, said. But residents refused to move out of their houses for different reasons. \u201cThe residents are not encroachers at all. They have been paying a sum between Rs 80,000 and Rs one lakh in installments to the slum clearance board to own the land. In 1990s, the TNSCB has signed a lease cum agreement with the residents. As per the agreement, residents would be provided patta if they pay a sum between Rs 2,000 and Rs 8,000 per square feet of their house,\u201d district president of the Tamil Nadu Odukapattor Valvurimai Iyyakam A Ashraf Ali, who have been working with the residents, said.

Acknowledging that such an agreement was signed, an official from TNSCB said it was to compensate the amount that they had paid, they were provided alternative accommodation at free of cost and they have no other option but to obey court\u2019s order.

Activists have petitioned the city corporation officials, urging them to take immediate steps to retrieve the land. The layout was formed in 1988 with 21 plots. About 10% of the total layout area - i.e., 28.37 cents - was reserved to create a park site, as per the directorate of town and country planning (DTCP) approval. As per the Town and Country Planning Act and high court directions, the land reserved as OSR could not be used for any other purpose and none other than the local body could claim ownership of it. But the norms are being violated here, said activist S P Thiyagarajan, who escalated the issue. \u201cThe corporation had regularized the OSR land in 2009 and collected vacant land tax for the property. It, however, issued building approval licence in 2011. The land was then documented in the name of the layout promoter\u2019s brother and later purchased in 2013. But no construction activities were carried out in the plot till date,\u201d he said. The issue came to light only when the promoter fenced the plot in 2018. After the residents lodged a complaint, the city corporation installed a board claiming its ownership, the activist said. \u201cIt is the only open space we have in our layout.

We decided this as it would be favourable in aspects such as pollution control,\u201d he told TOI.The group purchased 55 acres at Devampalayam in 1997. \u201cIn 2007 we got the land converted for industrial use and in 2016, applied for the layout approval. We got the approval in December 2018,\u201d said Soundararajan. The society had declared the investment at the first Global Investors Meet in 2015.The next step was to develop common infrastructure such as roads, stormwater drains and electric lights. The industrialists have estimated a budget of Rs 15crore for the work.As the state gives subsidy for setting up private industrial estates, the society has applied for it through the Tamil Nadu Small Industries Development Corporation Limited (SIDCO). \u201cWe are expecting the sanction within two months. After that, we would implement the project in six months,\u201d Soundararajan said.Currently, the member industries have plants operating in the city at places such as Ganapathi and Avarampalayam.

Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

The termination order was issued on Saturday. Panchayat secretary Suresh Kumar, who was working at the panchayat in 2016, was also suspended for failing to monitor and control such activities in his panchayat. A senior official from the district rural development agency (DRDA) said, \u201cIn 2016, Maheshwari was in charge of identifying the households without toilets and assisting the villagers to construct a toilet under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan scheme. Motivator Sathya was in charge of motivating the public to join the scheme. But they had collected Rs 1,500 - Rs 2,000 per house as bribe and promised them to get a government subsidy of Rs 12,000 for each toilet. Believing their words, the villagers constructed the toilets by taking loans. But the villagers never got the government subsidy. All these came out during an inquiry conducted by the BDO after TOI reported about the scam on June 11.\u201d \u201cIt is also proved that the bribe amount - Rs 1.48 lakh - which Maheshwari distributed to 87 villagers on June 13 was her own money and not the incentive amount of Sathya as she claimed. Sathya was dismissed one and half years ago,\u201d the official added. The block co-ordinator and motivator are temporary posts filled by BDO, who has powers to terminate them. In its report on June 11, TOI revealed that over 100 residents of Ichipatti village near Palladam in Tirupur were waiting for the subsidy for more than three years after constructing household toilets by taking loans. Though the original scheme envisages funding \u2013 subsidy of Rs 12,000 per toilet - at various stages of construction, the prospective beneficiaries had to beg and borrow to construct toilets as the officials had only promised to reimburse the expenditure once the facility is ready.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

An overactive bladder (OAB), once considered a medical condition affecting the elderly population, is now being seen among younger men and women. \u201cOveractive bladder is a problem where the bladder-storage functions become impaired, resulting in a sudden urge to urinate. In some cases, the urge may be so strong that it can result in leaks before you can reach the bathroom,\u201d urologist at city-based Vedanayagam Hospital Dr Ganesh Gopalakrishnan said. \u201cIf you\u2019re using the bathroom more than about eight times in 24-hour and if the urge keeps increasing, this could be a sign that there is something wrong,\u201d he said. Some patients, with OAB, experience leakages when they laugh, sneeze or even jump because it puts pressure on the bladder. \u201cMost people who suffer from urinary incontinence live with it because they believe there is nothing they can do about it,\u201d urologist at GKNM Hospital Dr K S Vengetesh said. \u201cHowever, people hesitate to discuss it with doctors due to embarrassment. It often leads to low self-esteem and social isolation,\u201d a doctor said. However, another urologist said patients need to be aware that an overactive bladder is a common medical condition and can be treated or managed well. \u201cWith OAB, the bladder works overtime, contracting more often than it should and at inappropriate times. The bladder muscles seem to give wrong messages to the brain causing the bladder to feel fuller than it is. The bladder contracts too early when the bladder is not very full,\u201d Dr C L Dinakaran of Arun Urology Hospital said. OAB can be managed with lifestyle changes, diet, medication and even surgery. \u201cIt is advisable to limit your caffeine intake, refrain from alcohol and spicy food,\u201d Dr Vengetesh said.

They said the population of native cattle breeds, especially the Malai Kongu Maadu, had dropped drastically after farmers were banned from grazing their cattle in reserve forest zones. They also demanded that the price at which Aavin buys A2 milk from farmers should be tripled, to encourage more farmers to breed and maintain native cow breeds. Farmers led by the Kongu Patteeshwaran Ghoshala have requested the collector to make the forest department again issue \u201cpatti passes\u201d to cattle farmers. \u201cThis is a pass that the forest department was issuing to allow us to graze our cattle in forest areas and lands. Around the year 2000-\u201901, there were nearly 1.5 lakh to 2 lakh Malai Kongu Maadu cows across villages in and around Thondamuthur, including Madhampatti, Karadimadai and Viraliyur,\u201d T Shanmugam, a member of the Ghoshala, said. \u201cHowever, in 2002, when the forest department withdrew our patti passes and banned ours and our cattle\u2019s entry in forest areas, many farmers panicked and sold thousands of their native cows to slaughter houses. We have a few thousand cows of the native breed left,\u201d he said. The farmers said the government should incentivize rearing of native breeds of cattle. \u201cWhile one way is to allow us to graze in forest areas, the other one is to make Aavin buy A2 milk from us farmers for at least Rs 50 to Rs 60 per litre. They currently buy it for Rs 20 per litre, which is the cost for A1 milk. They have only one category called milk,\u201d Shanmugam said. \u201cThey should also ban construction on hill area conservation lands and foothills of mountains, because it eventually takes away greenery and open lands which can be used for grazing,\u201d he added. The cattle farmers said the ban on cattle has affected their environment in multiple ways. \u201cWhenever our cattle used to graze in the forest fringes, wild animals never came out of the forest. We have never seen wild elephants, bears and leopards. Now, they have begun coming inside our villages. The grazing cow\u2019s urine and dung was so beneficial to the soil that the forests were thicker, and they used to eat grass so well that fresh grass kept growing. Now we have less greenery and temperature is higher. We have also had to start using chemical pesticides, because we don\u2019t have enough cow urine to make biopesticides,\u201d the petition said.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

But how can small farmers float companies? Where can we go for funds and maintenance of the companies? Instead of asking small farmers to form companies in order to get permission to tap neera, the government should launch collection centres to collect neera from individual farmers. Such centres should be set up in places known for coconut cultivation, such as Pollachi and Sulur,\u201d the union leader said. To set up farmer producer companies, permission is needed from five departments including excise and food safety, Babu said. \u201cIf the government procures neera from us, we will be spared from these procedures. Neera procured from us can be tested in government labs to ensure quality. The model we suggest is similar to the Aavin, where a state-run organisation procures milk from farmers directly.\u201d Currently, the state gives permit to tap neera only to companies, which have set up cold chain facilities. This is to ensure that the drink is stored at 3C. Otherwise it would turn into toddy, which is banned in the state.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\".

It is \"completely separate from our ongoing discussions with India about the importance of ensuring the free flow of data across borders,\" the spokeswoman added. Earlier on Thursday, India said it was in talks with the United States on H-1B visas, but foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar told a news conference: \"We have not heard anything officially from the US government\" on capping such permits for Indians. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo is scheduled to visit New Delhi next week for talks that will include areas of disagreement between the two countries over trade. H-1B cap for India? It\u2019s not easy and may need approval by US Congress, say expertsTwo senior Indian officials told Reuters on Wednesday they had been briefed last week on a US plan to cap the number of H-1B visas given annually to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the total number issued. There is no country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas the United States issues every year, and an estimated 70% of them go to Indians.

Farming goes organic in Coimbatore": {"datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/eat-healthy-farming-goes-organic-in-coimbatore/articleshow/69882143.cms", "time": "2019-06-21 04:49:00", "description": "Though Coimbatore was known as a hub of entrepreneurial farming, the organic cultivation scene had been rather bleak. The number of farmers as well as area under organic farming had been negligible in the district and there had hardly been any sign of pesticide free cultivation picking up. But the situation transformed after 2016, incidentally the year when neighbouring Kerala threatened to ban pesticide ridden vegetables coming from Tamil Nadu. Since then there has been a 50% increase in the number of certified organic farmers and 45% increase in acreage. According to the Tamil Nadu Organic Certification Department, only 106 farmers had obtained the certification from 2007, when TNOCD was formed, to 2016. But in the past three years, the number has gone up to 160. At least 30 more farmers are likely to get certified in the next couple of months. The area under certified organic cultivation too has increased from 1,523 acres to 2,533 acres during the same period. Since TNOCD is recognized by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Exports Development Authority, farmers can later apply for APEDA certification too if they intend to export their products. Officials in the department say most of their applicants are those who cultivate perennial crops - coconut, pulses, spices like pepper and turmeric and fruits like mango, sapotta - among others. \u201cOnly 20% of the farms we have certified cultivate vegetables, because vegetables are difficult to cultivate organically,\u201d said assistant director of the organic certification department Irene Priyadarshini. \u201cSince we have lost native variety seeds of vegetables, we depend on hybrid varieties produced by private companies, which are susceptible to pests and diseases,\u201d she said. While these are parcels of land that have been certified, there are also many farmers who are part of the state government encouraged participatory guarantee scheme and Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY). \u201cUnder the participatory guarantee scheme, participants can certify each other. This scheme is extremely popular in areas like Thondamuthur and Anamalai Hills, where at least 30 farmers in each of those two blocks are involved in organic farming. They will apply for certification and pesticide residue tests in a year or two,\u201d said a senior horticulture department officer. \u201cWhile a few of them do vegetables, most are into cultivation of grapes, watermelon, nuts and spices, among others,\u201d she said. However, the numbers are still a drop in the bucket considering that Coimbatore has 2 lakh hectares of cultivated land. \u201cMany big farmers are still hesitant to get into organic farmers, because they believe that they may not sustain a crop till the soil slowly gets back its original bacteria and nutrients. Many are yet to be convinced that organic cultivation can be done commercially successfully. But the situation is improving. We get at least one new farmer walking through our doors every day, compared to hardly three or four in a month, five years ago,\" said head of sustainable and organic farming department, TNAU, E Somasundaram. \"We also conduct training programmes for interested farmers along with personal guidance and field visits every month,\" he said. Organic farmers say the market for certified organic produce in the city is good. \u201cThe yield of organically cultivated crops is lesser than commercial crops, but we save on all the input costs. And certified produce is in high demand and sells at a better price. So, the net profit is as good as commercial cultivation and we feel good to cultivate safe and healthy food,\u201d said Madhu Ramakrishnan, who cultivates coconut, nutmeg, pepper and betel leaves in his farm in Sethumadai.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Rajeshwari, a worker at a tea estate at Chinnakallar, wanted to admit her six-year-old son Shiva to the nearby school, but was upset as the school in her locality was closed and the Adi Dravidar Welfare School at Periyakallar was 4km away.

But the threat is there. As the family is from the same locality and is used to elephant visits, they are not scared. Still, we have been trying to convince his mother to move her son to the school at Periyakallar. If she agrees, the school would be closed,\u201d he added.

But now, the committee\u2019s inspection services have almost no takers in the textile industry. With around 30 offices across the country, the textiles committee which comes under the union textiles ministry, was functioning with many objectives. While hosting one of textile power centers, Tamil Nadu alone has six textiles committee offices, barring another one closed in Salem a year ago. More than 20 quality assurance officers were associated with the offices. \u201cEarlier, one of the major goals was to regulate quality of all goods exported from textile units because the government wanted to ensure that the quality should not become an issue. But in 2004, the government took decision of leaving the quality as a matter between the foreign buyers and the exporters, so the mandatory regulation was dropped,\u201d said a senior official associated with the textiles committee. However, the committee had started to offer inspection services as it can act as a third party between the buyers and the manufacturers. The committee has adequate infrastructure including textile labs and technically sound employees but do not have many takers. \u201cWe were not approached for the services by the industry despite having all the capacities.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.
