Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

But the Renuka, Kishau and Lakhwar-Vyasi dams, proposed in the 1960s, are nowhere near completion. Delhi Jal Board vice-chairman Dinesh Mohaniya said that only the bypass ducts at the Kishau dam have been constructed till date. \u201cIt will take many decades for any water to reach the city from these dams,\u201d Mohaniya shrugged. With no positive change in the Himalayan situation expected at the moment, DJB is now relying on the Singapore-inspired 'new water policy' to avert a Chennai-like situation in the capital. In the first phase of the policy, 246 MGD water can be availed by purifying sewage water and re-feeding the Yamuna upstream at Palla on the border with Haryana. \u201cIn the long term, this model has a huge potential. It is the only way we can meet the increasing demand,\u201d said Mohaniya. \u201cAs it is, almost 90% of the water consumed by Delhi is released as waste water, which is already being purified and used downstream in Uttar Pradesh.\u201d The proposal on re-use of water is awaiting the approval of the Upper River Yamuna Board for six months now. \u201cWe have finalised the tender documents,\u201d the DJB vice-chairman said. \u201cEven Union minister Nitin Gadkari instructed the officials to expedite the work, but the project is still stuck in red tape.\u201d Another key policy intervention being proposed by DJB is the creation of a buffer water stock with a mega reservoir in Palla. \u201cWe will acquire 1,000 acres of agricultural land there and remove the upper 1-1.5 metres of soil to avoid pesticide contamination. Detailed studies and research have been carried out by institutions like IIT-Delhi on using the Yamuna floodplain for this purpose,\u201d explained Ankit Srivastava, technical advisor, DJB. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, also the DJB chairperson, requested central government assistance in the construction of the reservoir at the last Niti Aayog meeting. \u201cImportant studies show that in case the reservoir is built, water stored during a single monsoon season will be sufficient to end Delhi\u2019s water shortage for two years,\u201d a government official claimed. To check the alarming fall in groundwater levels \u2014 though DJB refutes Niti Aayog\u2019s contention that the capital will exhaust all its groundwater by 2020 \u2014 the water utility has come up with the zero liquid discharge policy. \u201cRain water harvesting systems only function for the 20-30 days that Delhi gets rains, but the new system will work year round,\u201d Mohaniya said. In the zero liquid discharge system, waste water treatment arrangements are made for local reuse of water, with a sensor installed at the water outlet. All waste water will have to be mandatorily used for horticulture purposes within the complex. The slow percolation of this water into the soil will recharge the underground aquifers. The new system hasn\u2019t yet caught the popular imagination, though.

AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal had nominated Chadha to attend the meeting. But around 1.5 hours before the meeting, Chadha was informed that only the party president could attend it. Chadha also wrote that tinkering with time-tested conventions of elections can create political unrest and regional instability. \u201cIdeas such as constitutional amendments for simultaneous elections and imposing President\u2019s Rule without constitutional breakdown are an attempt to fix what isn\u2019t broken, and undermines India\u2019s plural democratic polity,\u201d he added. \u201cWill the people have to wait till the Lok Sabha election to get another democratically-elected assembly if a state government chooses to dissolve itself, or loses its majority and the President\u2019s Rule is clamped on the state? What if that waiting period is one or two years or more? Is the state expected to be beholden to the Union government for elections to its state?\u201d Chadha asked. The ruling party in Delhi also asked if the rule would apply to the Centre and whether the country would remain under President\u2019s Rule for the remaining duration of the five-year period if the Union government lost its majority. \u201cWe feel compelled to term such a situation as a constitutional oligarchy. It will certainly not be parliamentary democracy,\u201d Chadha stated. \u201cThe harrowing experience of Emergency, where Lok Sabha and some assemblies were extended beyond five years and other assemblies dissolved to suit Congress\u2019s political interest, is worth recalling as a caveat against enforcing elections in any manner contrary to the five-year cycle being followed,\u201d the letter stated.

Many syndicates of illegal firearms were kept under watch,\u201d said Manishi Chandra, DCP (counterintelligence cell). A team comprising ACP Manoj Dixit and inspectors Vivekanand and Kuldeep received a tip-off that a huge consignment of arms would exchange hands near Jheelwala Park, Sector 3, Rohini, early on Wednesday. The team laid a trap on a service road near the park. The two men were spotted waiting for someone, so the team waited for the prospective buyer to turn up. After some time, the criminals felt the police presence and started to move out. However, the team overpowered them and seized the weapons. \u201cDuring interrogation, the two men disclosed that trading in illegal firearms was their hereditary occupation and they had been doing this for over 10 years. They had learnt the skill of manufacturing firearms from their family members who have been running the business for over 80 years. Their family members manufacture illegal arms at a cottage industry and supply it to various parts of the country, including Delhi,\u201d Chandra said. Pawan said he had been sending consignments of illegal arms to criminal gangs operating out of Delhi, UP, Haryana, MP, among others through various courier chains. Manufacturing a pistol costs around Rs 7,000 and the finished product gets sold for about Rs 25,000. Pawan was found involved in five cases under the Arms Act in MP.

They will have to vacate the hostel at the end of their first year in May.

He agreed that the outdoor gyms should not be concretised and accepted our proposal to remove the concrete,\u201d said Verhean Khanna, founder of New Delhi Nature Society. Khanna said the activists pointed out that other civic agencies like the South Delhi Municipal Corporation and North Delhi Municipal Council have set up outdoor gyms without concrete flooring, which are working perfectly. DDA officials couldn\u2019t be contacted for a response. \u201cDoctors, environmentalists, fitness enthusiasts and senior citizens have expressed a preference to outdoor gyms with soil flooring instead of the expensive safety rubber on top of concrete flooring,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cSince the outdoor gyms with artificial flooring are detrimental to the environment and does not serve any function besides decoration, there is a need to change the plan and remove all the artificial flooring which is covering the soil from all DDA outdoor gyms.\u201d Earlier, a day after the TOI report, DDA de-choked the trees at Sanjay Van but the concrete flooring was kept for the under-construction gym. \u201cWe found that a grassy area inside Sanjay Van was being cemented for an outdoor gym, including around the trees. We informed the staff about the court order to remove cement from trees, but no action was taken. The next day when the story was in the news, within a few hours the cement was removed from the trees, according to the National Green Tribunal order dated April 23, 2013. Please notify all DDA parks to ensure open soil space up to 1 meter around every tree in their jurisdiction,\u201d Khanna, in another letter to the DDA, said.

You can now choose a registration number of your choice by paying Rs 25,000. Delhi government\u2019s transport department auctions the most sought after \u2018fancy numbers\u2019, such as 0001 or 9999, for a hefty minimum reserve price. However, the department now wants to extend the choice by allowing car buyers to get a registration number of their liking at the time of purchase itself, provided it\u2019s not one of the fancy numbers that it auctions. The transport department issued a notification, which will allow allocation of desired registration numbers to car buyers for a flat fee of Rs 25,000. Earlier, car buyers could get registration numbers of their choice by paying Rs 20,000, but only after making the rounds of the transport department. Now the buyers can get the number of their choice at the car dealership itself. \u201cWhile numbers such as 0001 or 1111 are always the most sought after and are auctioned for large sums of money, we realised that there could be numbers that might appear random to others but might be sought after by a particular buyer for some personal reason. The number could be someone\u2019s date of birth or residence address,\u201d a transport department official said. \u201cWe have found that many first time car buyers, particularly the youth, have a craze for fancy numbers. While the numbers that we auction might be too expensive for many, they can now opt for a number of their choice when buying a car,\u201d he said. The official said that the registration numbers will be available online at vehicle dealerships, where these can be chosen without visiting a transport department office even once. \u201cAs soon as the payment for a car is made, the car buyer will be given the choice to opt for a registration number among a series of numbers. The buyer will have half-an-hour\u2019s time before finalising the registration number of his/ her choice,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe fee will have to be paid online\u201d. Meanwhile, owners of two wheelers can also opt for fancy numbers through e-auction now. The minimum reserve price for the series 0001 for two wheelers would be Rs 50,000, Rs 30,000 for series 0002 to 0009, Rs 20,000 for 0010 to 0099, 0786, 1000, 1111, 7777 and 9999 and Rs 15,000 for other fancy numbers. The e-auction of fancy numbers is a good source of revenue for the transport department thanks to the craze among Delhiites for \u2018VIP\u2019 numbers. In June 2017, the department landed a windfall after a registration number of 0001 was auctioned for Rs 16 lakh, the highest ever. The completely online e-auctioning facility for fancy registration numbers is conducted by the Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. on behalf of the transport department. Earlier, allotment of the fancy registration numbers, popularly known as VIP numbers, was purely discretionary. In 2014, Delhi government framed rules wherein a minimum reserve price of these numbers was fixed and it was decided to conduct e-auctioning of these numbers.

Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital.

We have to make the situation better than last year and bring down the number of cases of vector-borne diseases,\u201d Kejriwal said. Since 2015, the cases of vector-borne diseases have been declining in the city. This has been attributed to the joint efforts of Delhi government and people, who were regularly made aware about how to fight the diseases. In 2015, a total of 15,867 dengue cases were reported in Delhi, which decreased to 4,431 in 2016 and 2,798 in 2018. From 7,760 cases of chikungunya reported in 2015, the number reduced to 473 in 2018, the government said in a statement. Kejriwal stressed on the importance of prevention and awareness to control the spread of vector-borne diseases during the rainy season and immediately after it. Earlier, Delhi government had carried out extensive campaigns by involving RWAs and schoolchildren as awareness ambassadors against dengue and chikungunya. The major reason for the spread of dengue and chikungunya is the breeding of aedes mosquitoes in freshwater. In Delhi, activities related to management and surveillance of vector-borne diseases are carried out by the five local bodies. Domestic breeding checkers play the primary role in containing the diseases by visiting homes for identification of breeding sites and carrying out anti-larval measures. The civic bodies have been directed to ensure availability of sufficient stocks of larvicides, insecticides, fogging machines, etc at the ward level. They have also been entrusted with the job of enforcement, for which they issue challans. Delhi government will be holding regular review meetings to monitor the preparedness of the agencies so that the situation is kept under control. Health minister Satyendar Jain stressed on efficient monitoring. \u201cOur response should be very quick,\u201d he added, while directing the municipal corporations to have a strong monitoring team to keep a regular check on the on-ground teams and to get feedback for additional steps that need to be taken in this regard. Jain said awareness material on the measures to be taken for preventing the diseases must reach every resident. The health department has been directed to implement the timetable for the preparedness for hospitals to tackle the diseases.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Feeling perhaps that despite this, the students of government school have missed out on top-class sports infrastructure, the education department has reached out to the Public Works Department for the construction of sports complexes in institutions under its jurisdiction. The revamp of school infrastructure in Delhi also includes the construction of 25 new schools with modern amenities. In the 2019-20 budget, Delhi government allocated Rs 15,601 crore, or 26% of the budget, to education. Of this, Rs 7,818 crore has been earmarked for projects and plans. New schools and sports complexes are two of the major projects undertaken in this regard. Thirteen schools with the space required to install games facilities are already on their way to having these complexes. Work on creating synthetic running tracks, courts for basketball and volleyball and grounds for cricket and football, apart from swimming polls, is already under way, and some of them are scheduled to be completed by October at a total spend of Rs 1,180 crore. Among the institutions where these facilities will come up are Government Senior Secondary Girls\u2019 School in Jhilmil in east Delhi, Government Senior Secondary School in west Delhi\u2019s Paschim Vihar, and Government Boys\u2019 Senior Secondary School in north-west Delhi\u2019s Bawana. Once the 13 complexes are finished, the scheme will be extended to other schools that have adequate space for such facilities. Over five lakh students will benefit from the new infrastructure. \u201cEducation and health are primary concerns of this government and we want to take every measure to ensure these benefits for school children,\u201d said a government official. PWD was roped into to help the education department achieve this objective. \u201cThe education department told us about students who excel academically but could not be provided facilities for extra-curricular activities. We were asked to create the infrastructure that would assist the growth of children who cannot afford to take admission in sports academies,\u201d said a PWD official. He added that the schools would hire coaches to bring the government school at a par with their private counterparts. Apart from the sports complexes, the construction of 25 new schools is also under way across Delhi. \u201cThere was a dire need for schools at these locations where the children were being asked to study in tented structures,\u201d explained an official. The new schools would have modern amenities such as technology assisted classrooms, multi-utility areas, sports complexes and recreational areas to aid the overall development of the children. These schools are being erected in Vasant Kunj, Aya Nagar, Sultanpur, Tehkhand, Satbari, Sarita Vihar, Dariyapur Kalan, Rana Pratap Bagh, Bhalswa, Libaspur, Ghoga, Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar, Janakpuri, Uttam Nagar, Garhi Rindhala, Ladpur, Sector 5, Sector 18 and Sector 27 of Rohini, two schools in Sector 16 of Dwarka, Jaffarpur Kalan, Nangli Shakrawati and Qutabpur (Qutab Vihar).

The AAP had on June 10 moved a petition in the Delhi Assembly and sought disqualification of its two rebel MLAs -- Anil Bajpai from Bijwasan seat and Devinder Sehrawat from Gandhi Nagar -- who had been openly critical of the party and had joined the BJP on May 3 and May 6 respectively. Saurabh Bhardwaj, the spokesperson of the Aam Aadmi Party said the outfit was expecting the two MLAs to quit \"legally and morally\", but since that did not happen, it decided to move the petition against them. He further said, \"Action can be taken against other rebel MLAs too and till now action has been taken against these two.\" The two other MLAs who can be on party's radar are Chandni Chowk MLA Alka Lamba and Karawal Nagar MLA Kapil Mishra as both of them have been vocal against the party's actions and decisions. Meanwhile, a Delhi government official said once Bajpai and Sehrawat submit their replies, the Speaker will examine them. \"The Speaker will go by the laid down rules and will announce his decision,\" the official said. While Sehrawat said that he has received a notice from the speaker, Bajpai said there is no merit in AAP's petition as the case of office of profit against him is still subjudice. \"Under the existing laws, they (AAP) have not issued a proper notice. Even on the BJP dais, I had said that I have not taken the party membership... There is a due process before seeking my disqualification and I have not received any notice directly from the AAP,\" Sehrawat said. But Bhardwaj said that if that is the case then both Bajpai and Sehrawat should openly say that BJP leaders Manoj Tiwari and Vijay Goel are lying and they are not associated with the BJP and still support the Aam Aadmi Party. Last year, the Delhi High Court restored the membership of 20 disqualified AAP MLAs and referred the case back to the Election Commission (EC).

We want to extend all possible help needed by the Bihar government in tackling it.\u201d AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said that Bihar was one of the early adopters of the Ayushman Bharat scheme. \u201cIt is incomprehensible that if this scheme is designed to treat poor patients in private hospitals free of cost, then why is this not happening in Bihar? The visuals clearly indicate that the victims are from extremely poor families. Why is it that there aren\u2019t enough ICUs, doctors, air-conditioning or beds available for them?\u201d he asked. Even health minister Satyendar Jain wondered why the children are not being treated at private hospitals under Ayushman Bharat scheme. Sisodia said the scheme has turned out to be a white elephant in Bihar. \u201cThe scheme has failed the people of the country and is not practical. The requirement is to strengthen infrastructure and access for all to healthcare. This scheme is more about paying insurance companies than taking care of the health of the people,\u201d he added.

There has been a massive 316% rise in the number of complaints about removal of garbage from 2015 to 2018. \u201cIn 2015, 1,830 people complained about no garbage collection. The figure rose to 7,606 in 2018. Despite the city-wide implementation of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the civic agencies failed to arrange for lifting of garbage regularly from neighbourhoods,\u201d said Yogesh Mishra, research and data head, Praja Foundation. \u201cBesides collection, segregation and processing of garbage has not seen a major change. That\u2019s why the Ghazipur landfill in east Delhi is set to become taller than Qutub Minar by mid-2020,\u201d Mishra said, adding that no sincere effort has been made to ease the burden of the site and a large volume of waste continues to go there. EDMC contested the report. \u201cWe are not dumping garbage on the mound but at a previously unutilised corner of the landfill. Also, decentralised processing and segregation is picking up day by day. We don\u2019t agree with the NGO\u2019s claim,\u201d said a senior EDMC official. The report adds only one in four public toilets are for women. \u201cIn terms of toilet to population ratio, the Swachh Bharat norm for public toilets is one toilet seat for 100-400 men and 100-200 women. In Delhi, there is one toilet seat for 3,982 men and 9,630 women,\u201d Mishra said. Multiplicity of agencies and the lack of a mechanism to redress grievances is a worry too, said Nitai Mehta, founder and managing trustee of Praja Foundation. Andrews Ganj councillor Abhishek Dutt agreed that all municipal zones in south Delhi have different phone numbers. \u201cThey take complaints for their areas only and often become non-operational. I am going to write to the authority for introducing a common number and tracking their status regularly,\u201d said Dutt.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

She had recently completed her BCom and was currently interning with an accounting firm. She used to go daily to Jagatpuri for work and used to take the bus plying on route 211. On Tuesday, Thakur took the cluster bus. When it reached Jagatpuri, she stood on the footboard to alight. However, police said that before she could get down, the driver accelerated the vehicle. She lost her balance and fell on the road suffering severe injuries to her head. The driver allegedly did not stop and sped away. Later, Thakur was shifted a nearby hospital where she was declared dead. The body was handed over to her family members after an autopsy. The family got to know about the involvement of the cluster bus through the ticket found in Thakur\u2019s pocket, which contained the details of the vehicle\u2019s registration number. It has been handed over to police for investigation. A case of dangerous driving and causing death due to negligence has been registered at Jagatpuri police station. Police are scanning CCTV footage from the accident site to get the sequence of events and to identify the driver. Cops are also speaking to cluster bus officials to seek information about the suspect. A team of forensic experts later visited the spot and collected evidence for investigation.

This has been proven by the enrolment data of the colleges in the city. The conclusion was reached after looking at the 2018 and 2019 National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) data of 24 colleges. DU has 63 colleges under it. Out of the 24 colleges, the enrolment of outstation students in 10 is more than 60%. Colleges where close to 70% students are from outside the state include Miranda House, Hindu College, St Stephen\u2019s, Hansraj, Kirori Mal and Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC). The numbers have been increasing gradually over the years owing to the popularity of the colleges. Speaking to TOI, Simrit Kaur, principal of SRCC, said, \u201cOur college is considered the best in commerce and that is the reason why several students apply here. Since DU is a national university, we get applications from meritorious students from across the country.\u201d In South Campus, most outstation students take admission in Shri Venkateswara College and Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College. Acharya Narendra Dev College, which is neither in north or south campus, has the highest number of outstation students, and their number have been increasing every year. The same holds true for Gargi College which has seen a rise in the number of outstation students from 51% in 2016-2017 to 61% in 2017-18. ARSD, which is well-known for its sciences courses, saw a massive jump of 18% in outstation students within one year (2017-18). Gyantosh Jha, the principal of the college, said, \u201cOur college became popular after getting high rankings over the years. Many students told me that they applied after looking at the NIRF rankings. The college is in close proximity to Faridabad and Gurugram, so more students applying to DU prefer to come here.\u201d Barring these exceptions, many colleges, including Shivaji and Maharaja Agrasen, which are funded by Delhi government, have more than 55% students from Delhi. In 2017, Delhi government had said it would explore the option of giving 85% reservation to Delhi students. Even popular colleges like Lady Shri Ram College for Women (LSR) and Jesus and Mary have a larger number of students from Delhi.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

One of the key things that I learnt is that the whole online space that we as couturiers don\u2019t look at in India is the space growing at phenomenal speed. Kudos to all the women who believed in themselves, left their jobs as investment bankers, engineers, lawyers and started investing their time and money in their own talent.

When I look at all these women, and also women at my home and office, I feel I lack so much \u2013 multi-tasking, gut feeling.

He was 81. The Centre also staged one of Karnad\u2019s popular plays, Agni Aur Barkha (Hindi adaptation of Kannada play Agni Mattu Male). It was directed by KS Rajendran, who was associated with the thespian for the last 15 years and has directed three of his plays \u2013 Agni Aur Barkha, Wedding Album, and Bali. Karnad has used devices such as play within a play (garbha natak) in Agni Aur Barkha \u2018Agni Aur Barkha is a challenge for any director\u2019 Play\u2019s director KS Rajendran said, \u201c Agni Aur Barkha is a dense and multilayered text. Its dramaturgy is very complex and a challenge for any director who wants to bring the text alive on stage. Several narratives run simultaneously in the play and the audience realise the fact that they are all inter-related only at the end of the performance. I like plays dealing with eternal questions of humanity through mythological characters. Agni Aur Barkha is basically drawn from the Aranya Parva of the Mahabharata. So we decided to present this one as a tribute to the thespian.\u201d Talking more about the play, he added, \u201cThe opening scene was a pure theatrical rendition, without any realistic representation of a yagna. Many such challenges are hidden in this play. Play within a play (garbha natak) is a wonderful device that Karnad has used in this text. These things made me chose this play.\u201d Appreciating the actors as well the audience in Delhi, Rajendran said, \u201cThe best part about performing in Delhi is that the city has trained actors and a dedicated audience, who know how to appreciate theatre.\u201d \u2018Karnad\u2019s plays resonate across age groups\u2019Hemant Bharat Ram, trustee and Executive Vice-President of the SRPCA, said, \u201cGirish Karnad wrote with great depth and complexity. His plays are timeless and resonate across age groups. Agni Aur Barkha exemplifies these qualities. That is why we decided to present this play before the Delhi audience as a tribute to the playwright.\u201d \u2018An absorbing tale... absolute delight\u2019 Theatre enthusiasts Sushmita and Salil Bhandari, who came along with their daughter Shambhavi, called it a \u201cpowerful performance\u201d. \u201cIt was an absolute delight to watch such an absorbing tale. It has so many layers to it. The dialogues and acting were so powerful that throughout the two-and-a-half hour play, we were glued to our seats,\u201d they said. Another theatre enthusiast Vinod Aggarwal added, \u201cWhat stood out for me was the fact that it had several plots and sub-plots and that kept the audience hooked.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Soil and road dust and airborne fly ash are major sources of PM10 pollution in the summer. \u201cThe silt load on some of the Delhi\u2019s roads is very high and it can become airborne with the movement of vehicles, particularly in the dry season. The estimated PM10 emission from road dust is over 65 tonne per day,\u201d the IIT study stated. The Supreme Court-appointed body Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, which monitors the implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan, had banned night-time construction in Delhi on November 12, 2018, when air started deteriorating.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The panels were set up at a cost of Rs 20 lakh. \u201cWith the old fans being replaced with new ones as a part of the renovation process, the load has come down considerably. On Sundays, the surplus power is sent back to the discom\u2019s grid,\u201d Kumar said. In many other schools, while the power bill might not have come down to an absolute zero, the savings are massive. Hemant Sharma, principal of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Timarpur, said: \u201cWe used to run up a monthly power bill of around Rs 30,000. This has now come down to almost Rs 8,000. We hope bring it down to zero soon.\u201d The school has 1,800 children. In another school, which has solar panels of the highest capacity at 59 kW, the monthly bill has been lowered by nearly Rs 2 lakh. The school building also houses the offices of the district education officer and an SSA centre. The installation of solar panels has been completed in another 60 schools whereas the tendering process is under way in 40 others. The government is targeting 500 schools under this project. Pujarini Sen, a campaigner at Greenpeace India, said the time was ripe for the government to push solar energy. \u201cA number of private schools in Delhi have already shifted to solar energy. The savings from these can be immense. Government schools, meanwhile, had immense solar rooftop potential that was going unused till now,\u201d Sen said.

The Uttar Pradesh Private University Ordinance 2019 was passed by the state Cabinet on Tuesday. Clarifying the government\u2019s stand, state education minister Dinesh Sharma told TOI on Wednesday that universities are centres of learning and there should be no room for such activities. While the exact parameters of what constitutes anti-national activity have not been defined, Sharma referred to the 2016 \u201ctukde tukde\u201d incident in JNU to state that \u201csuch activities\u201d would not be allowed. \u201cIn some universities, anti-national slogans have been raised like \u2018Bharat tere tukde honge\u2019 and objectionable terms used to define the nation. In UP, we are here to teach and study, not to engage in any activity that seeks to divide,\u201d said Sharma. Adding that universities would be held liable if anything objectionable was said or done on their campuses, Sharma said the new ordinance would act as a shield for educational institutions. \u201cNow they [university administrations] can fix their agenda and let those speaking on campus know what cannot be said or discussed. The ordinance guarantees the right to speech but will not allow any anti-national activity. One is free to criticise leaders and the country but demanding its division is not permitted,\u201d added Sharma. Claiming that the ordinance ensured independence to universities while equipping the government to act like a watchman, the education minister added that even while granting honorary degrees, the government will not recommend names but clear only those proposed by the universities themselves. Giving the example of former JNU president Kanhaiya Kumar, who has been charged for his involvement in the \u2018tukde tukde\u2019 incident, Sharma said that if the court was to clear his name in the case, the government would have no objection if he were to be given an honorary degree. \u201cWe have no objection to a university inviting Kumar to speak, but he cannot say the \u2018tukde tukde\u2019 kind of things there. The college cannot claim that it did not know what he or anyone would be saying,\u201d he said. While the ordinance has been passed by the cabinet and will be presented in the upcoming assembly session scheduled to commence from July 18, Sharma remained non-committal on when it would be implemented. The 27 private universities in the state will be given one year to change their Acts in accordance with Ordinance.

In India alone, internet users are expected to reach a massive 672 million by the end of 2019. This number is significant for new age career seekers. The job market is in constant search for innovation and defined expertise to meet the demands of this ever-growing information consumer group. And as much as a traditional bachelor\u2019s degree is a useful item, there is nothing like a professional course in the field to doubly guarantee a future after studies. Beyond the conventional print and electronic media, there is a growing demand in every internet company for writers and content creators with hands-on knowledge of multimedia handling. For any internet company today, a 360-degree content creator is a huge asset. For these specialised jobs, the plain vanilla bachelor\u2019s degree, perhaps with honours, say in English, political science, geography or sociology is not preferred by the industry. That is where a professional and skill-based course like journalism opens up doors to all media entities in print, television, radio, event management corporates, advertising agencies, public relation offices, not to forget the currently fastest growing sector comprising non-media internet companies. Most traditional offline companies now have an online presence and so need people to manage their websites, but they too prefer skilled resources who understand digital media or journalism to an English graduate. \u201cA traditional bachelor\u2019s degree doesn\u2019t directly facilitate a job except for a few exceptional students because such courses are not at all geared to the job needs of the markets,\u201d said Pervin Malhotra, career counsellor. \u201cThe students will, at best, get entry-level jobs that don\u2019t require too many skills. This creates a lot of dissonance and social unrest. It is better, therefore, to pursue a course that is skill-based, for example mass media and journalism or IT.\u201d But there always is the option of entering the media with a degree in a humanities subject, such as English literature, isn\u2019t there? This has indeed been the traditional route, but as Anil Aneja, associate professor in Delhi University\u2019s department of English, explains, there is a difference. \u201cEnglish (H) does open up options for other succeeding course such as MA in English, MBA or a competitive exam, but journalism is a specific course typically for those who are decided and want to make a career in journalism. It is like law, which teaches specific skills.\u201d In fact, a digital media or journalism course has the highest job potential in terms of the number of jobs available in different sectors of media and internet. Even non-news websites like Zomato, Flipkart and Myntra attract people who are equipped with journalistic skills to manage their content requirements. So quite clearly, a course in journalism gives a student that extra edge. Agnitra Ghosh, assistant professor of journalism at Kamala Nehru College, said that the Delhi University\u2019s curriculum is comprehensive and offers both theory and skill-based aspects of the discipline. Bennett University, on the other hand, provides not only the basic studies, but also specialisations in 10 media disciplines, namely print, TV, web journalism, mobile, advertising, public relation, event management. It also ensures a full complement of skills. This can put aspirants in a dilemma. How does one zero in on where to study? In the case of Bennett University, its credentials speak for themselves. It draws its strength as the first media school owned by a media house and, therefore, knowledgeable about what future journalists should be equipped for. Apart from the state-of-the art facilities at its labs, it also has the best in-house expertise from The Times of India, Times Now and Times Internet, all of which helps it create a truly multi-media journalist. One of the critical factors in making the right choice is being acquainted with the academic rigour involved and the skill set one acquires in these three-year courses. At Bennett University, according to Sunil Saxena, the head of Times School of Media, student there spend 60% of their time in the state-of-the-art TV and radio studios developed in collaboration with Times Now and Radio Mirchi. \u201cThe three-year undergraduate programme in Journalism and Mass Communication at the Times School of Media course is very rigorous, with the students starting at 8.30 am and working till 5.30 pm,\u201d Saxena said. \u201cThe entire afternoon is spent in the lab or in the field, creating information bulletins, preparing newspaper reports, mobile reports or developing ad campaigns. The course aims to help the students acquire the relevant skills for a newsroom, advertising agency, digital site or e-commerce platform and even a public relations office.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Saif Ali Khan": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/world-cup-pakistani-man-tries-to-misbehave-with-saif-ali-khan-fans-back-on-social-media/videoshow/69859837.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "BJP Candidate List": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/news/amid-rumblings-over-ticket-denials-bjp-names-43-more-nominees-for-lok-sabha-polls/articleshow/68588890.cms", "time": "", "description": "NEW DELHI: Amid rumblings over ticket denials in some seats like Kanpur, where saffron veteran   Murli Manohar Joshi has been benched   , and Bangalore South, where the wife of late party leader Ananth Kumar was overlooked for a young debutant, BJP issued on Tuesday a list of 43 nominees for the Lok Sabha polls. Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The Congress leader hit out at BJP's strategy of playing the nationalist card. \"We are Congress\u2026 we launched the freedom movement\u2026 gave our blood and sweat\u2026 braved British atrocities \u2026 we don't need any certificate to prove our nationalist feelings especially from the ones who apologised to the British at that time\", asserted Priyanka, urging the workers to go to every household in their area and meet every voter. She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

Delhi could be on its way to \u2018Day Zero\u2019 too, according to Niti Aayog, which has predicted that the capital will exhaust its groundwater by next year. Experts, however, say the situation in Delhi isn\u2019t as dire as in Chennai, but certain pockets could well face a similar crisis owing to high groundwater extraction through illegal borewells. At present, Delhi has a water demand of 1,140 million gallons per day (MGD). It is able to supply only 936 MGD. And though the latest Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) data said 15% of the city could access groundwater only at depths 40 metres below ground, \u2018Day Zero\u2019, or the moment when severe restrictions would be evident in water supply, is unlikely to come anytime soon. \u201cThe situation in Delhi isn\u2019t as bad as Chennai,\u201d reiterated Jyoti Sharma, founder of FORCE, an NGO focused on water and sanitation. \u201cThe Yamuna is a major source of water for Delhi. There also are around 1,000 waterbodies. It is important to utilise the water available and recycle it effectively. Delhi also has two excellent policies in place making it mandatory for houses ranging between 100 to 500 square metres and over 500 square metres to ensure rainwater harvesting.\u201d Experts feel the Yamuna and waterbodies are crucial to ensuring Delhi does not approach \u2018Day Zero\u2019 like Chennai. FORCE, for instance, has estimated that Delhi can provide 165 litres per day per person if it exploits the annual rainfall. \u201cAn average family needs 700 litres of water per day, meaning the daily demand per person is 100-135 litres. This can be easily met if rainwater is effectively tapped,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cAny additional requirement can be met by recycling water. This is already being done, with watering of parks using such water.\u201d Shashank Shekhar of Delhi University\u2019s geology department leveraged the capital\u2019s geographical advantage in avoiding a Chennai-like situation. \u201cChennai is located close to the sea, so saline water is a problem. It also doesn\u2019t have a river. Delhi can tap the water through the Yamuna floodplain,\u201d he said. According to Shekhar, Delhi\u2019s push towards sewage treatment plants and recycling of water is key to the future, though people have to be educated about excess use and wastage of water. He added that individual water meters could be installed in all housing societies and apartment blocks so people are careful about using more water than they need. To conserve water, experts also encourage people to shift to buckets for baths instead of using showers and bathtubs. In addition, water-saving devices installed on faucets for as little as Rs 100 can reduce wastage of water. A Delhi Jal Board official said that even though parts of Delhi like the south and south-west region might actually run dry if appropriate steps were not taken, the Niti Aayog projections don\u2019t hold true for all of Delhi. \u201cThere are places in Delhi where water is still available at a ground depth of 5 metres,\u201d the official pointed out. However, in a bid to counter the alarmingly plunging groundwater levels \u2014 water in some areas in south Delhi like Kapashera can be found only 79 metres below ground \u2014 DJB has taken steps such as implementing the zero liquid discharge policy. \"The policy mandates recycling of waste water by bulk consumers and reuse of the water for horticulture purpose so it both recharges and saves groundwater,\u201d the official clarified. Another DJB official said they were not focusing on sealing the borewells due to the shortfall in supply. \u201cWe cannot supply water in these areas due to low availability but are also expected to shut their only source of water. How can that be?\u201d the official said.

After completing a comprehensive unit-wise survey in Phase-II of Mayapuri Industrial Area, the Special Task Force for sealing has issued closure notices to 41 units. Many of these polluting units were found to be operating with expired \u201cconsent to operate\u201d permits. Senior officials said this is the first phase of notices given in one block. In the last one month, several hundred units were checked in a door-to-door survey in Phase-II blocks A, C, D1, G1 and E. Delhi Police also carried out a sensitisation meeting with traders on Wednesday to avoid a law and order problem. The units issued notices have been carrying out activities like printing, washing jeans, repair of generators, manufacturing paint, denting and painting of car doors/bumpers, manufacturing electrical panels, among others. RK Gupta, the president of the local traders\u2019 association, said that scrap units have already been cleared and now the agencies are focusing on industrial units. \u201cThe traders are being told to close their factories within 24 hours, which is not practically possible. Why can\u2019t more time be given to units that have applied for new permits or whose permits have expired in the last fortnight?\u201d he argued. Traders also approached Delhi high court on Thursday for getting interim relief. Earlier in April, Mayapuri had witnessed large-scale violence in which 30 people got injured when Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) teams had come to seal the scrap units. DPCC had issued notices to 765 units that were not following the norms, but only six could be sealed as the situation grew out of control.

Police said the trio was caught red-handed near a railway crossing in Badalpur early on Thursday morning while carrying 745gm of heroin worth Rs 80 lakh on a bike. With their arrests, police claimed to have blown the lid off an inter-state banned substance supply module that used to get consignments from Bihar and sell the same in UP and Haryana. The arrests of the three \u2014 identified as boxer Himanshu Balbariya, a resident of Rewari district in Haryana, water purifier salesman Vikas (35), originally from Madhepura district in Bihar, and Dharmraj (30), a native of Badaun district in Uttar Pradesh \u2014 came on a tip-off. \u201cWe received information on Wednesday night that the three youths would be passing through Badalpur on a bike.

As soon as the police team spotted spotted the trio approaching the checkpost around 3am on Thursday, the cops signalled them to stop. \u201cRealising they were about to be caught, the accused tried to speed away. However, our men nabbed them after a brief chase, and recovered the heroin,\u201d Jaiswal added. During interrogation, Himanshu told cops that he was actually taking a lift from Vikas and Dharmraj who had come to Greater Noida to hand him over the consignment. \u201cHimanshu took to peddling drugs a few years ago to splurge on friends and support his lifestyle. He came in contact with Vikas and Dharamraj, and then the trio started sourcing banned substances from Vashishth Kumar, a resident of Munger district in Bihar, who also happens to be a cousin of Vikas,\u201d the SP (rural) said. \u201cHimanshu claimed to be a state-level boxer from Haryana, and is currently pursuing a law course at Kurukshetra University.

The hotter it gets, the more power is used. As the outdoor heat rises, it traps the city in a vicious cycle of more AC consumption, says a new study released by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) titled \u201cA Midsummer Nightmare\u201d. To stay thermally comfortable and do it sustainably, Delhi and other cities need to design their buildings in a manner to reduce the use of mechanical cooling systems. An eight-year trend analysis of energy consumption in Delhi showed no increase in demand when the heat index was within 25-32\u00b0C. The study stated that the average electricity consumption during the peak heatwave days of June 7-12, 2019 increased by 25% as compared with the season\u2019s average. This trend is expected to worsen nationally as the heat index and climatic stress are continuously increasing. India\u2019s heat index is increasing at the rate of +0.56\u00b0C per decade during summer (March-May) and +0.32\u00b0C during monsoon (June-September). In Delhi, 25-30% of the annual energy consumption is because of thermal stress, which occurs primarily due to concrete. In peak summers, it is said to be as high as 50%. Calling for designing buildings for reducing the heat load on them, promoting adaptive comfort, and cutting down over-dependence on air conditioning, CSE said better planning is required to change this trend. \u201cIf the growing discomfort due to increasing heat is not addressed with wide-ranging architectural design solutions, mixed use of cooling approaches (including less energy-intensive devices like fans) and improved energy efficiency of mechanical cooling methods, India\u2019s energy security and climate change mitigation efforts will be deeply undermined,\u201d said CSE executive director (research and advocacy) Anumita Roychowdhury. Rajneesh Sareen, programme director, CSE\u2019s sustainable habitat team, feels that the demand for space cooling in buildings is likely to explode even further, upsetting India\u2019s energy budget. \u201cCooling energy consumption in buildings is likely to double in the next decade and become nearly four times in the next 20 years as compared to the 2017-18 baseline,\u201d he added. Analysis of real-time data from State Load Dispatch Centre, Delhi for this summer, particularly the peak heatwave days of June 7-12, showed that the peak demand for electricity was higher and prolonged at night. \u201cThis clearly shows that households are more vulnerable and lesser equipped to deal with increased heat stress and are aggressively using electricity inefficiently to survive uncomfortable nights,\u201d said Avikal Somvanshi, the report\u2019s author and programme managerat CSE\u2019s sustainable habitat team. CSE also noted that there was an increase of 1% in peak energy demand per degree rise in temperature between 2018 and 2019 summers.
