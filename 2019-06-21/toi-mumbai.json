He was responding to a question raised by NCP member Rahul Narvekar through a Calling Attention notice in the state Legislative Council. \"A comprehensive report on equitable water distribution for Mumbai city and its suburban areas is ready. The report will be shared with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) soon and the civic body will be asked to implement it,\" Sagar said in the House. To another question, he said people living on forest land in Mumbai for years were not getting adequate drinking water supply, but the government will soon ensure it for them. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in 2016 announced setting up a committee to ensure equitable water distribution for the region coming under jurisdiction of the BMC. The Mumbai civic body loses around 25 to 27 per cent water due to leakages, Sagar noted. \"The government is trying hard to minimise such losses so that it can cater to the growing drinking water demand,\" he said. Sagar said though the number of city's permanent residents is limited, its floating population (those who keep moving from place to place) puts a lot of pressure on the administration. \"It is necessary to supply 270 litre of water per person in city areas, mainly due to the pressure of the floating population,\" the minister said.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

But this is possible provided the state legislature passes the bill to amend the Maharashtra Co-operatives Societies Act, 1960. The government is keen to tighten the noose around the corrupt elements operating within and around state's cooperative societies -from credit and sugar to housing societies. \"Earlier, test and special audit reports of the flying squads were not considered for FIRs under section 81. Following the proposed provision, all reports under same section could be treated as sufficient evidence, making it possible to initiate criminal or civil proceedings,\" said cooperatives minister Subhash Deshmukh, while recommending the House to enact the bill. Also, instead of one administrator or liquidator, a board of officials will be appointed to bring transparency in society affairs. \"As per section 103 of the Maharashtra Cooperatives Societies Act 1960, a liquidator can be appointed for winding up of a society,\" a copy of the bill stated. \"The liquidator is expected to complete liquidation proceedings within six years, but...may be extended up to 10 years, as prescribed in the Act. However, it was observed that for completing...liquidation proceedings, adequate number of officers were not available and the liquidator...had to perform the duties of liquidator in addition to regular duties.\" According to experts Vinod Sampat and Ramesh Prabhu, the cooperatives department is getting a bad name on account of certain acts by managing committee members and auditors appointed by the society. \"... new amendments will act as a deterrent on the managing committee as well as auditors who fail to carry out their statutory obligations,\" they said. \"Since one liquidator might not be able to devote sufficient time for the work ..., actual liquidation might not be complete within the time as prescribed in the provisions of the Act. If a board of persons would be appointed as liquidator, other members in the board will devote time, so that the work of liquidation could be undertaken speedily,\" Deshmukh said. \"Similarly, there was a provision to appoint an administrator as per section 110A of the said Act. However, as the administrator undertakes the work in addition to his regular duties, he might not be able to give adequate time for the work and there it was necessary to appoint a committee of administrators.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

At present, the penalty is Rs 200. In a related development, the BMC plans to allow motorists to park for free in public parking lots till they are given out to contractors. The BMC had intended to impose a penalty of up to Rs 10,000 for illegal parking on roads under the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act. However, anticipating it might be difficult to implement the plan under the law, the civic body requested the traffic police to seek changes to the Motor Vehicle Act. The BMC and traffic police plan to jointly implement the stiff fine, initially under MMC Act, from July 7. In the joint meeting of JCP (traffic) Madhukar Pande and his officers with zonal deputy municipal commissioners, they fixed the deadline. They also decided to explore the possibility of allowing public parking in vacant parts of BEST bus depots. \u201cEssentially, we are jointly working on a three-pronged strategy (awareness, appeal and enforcement) to decongest the roads wherever parking is available otherwise,\u201d said Pande. The meeting decided that all senior police inspectors (traffic) along with BMC ward officials will jointly inspect the BMC\u2019s available public parking lots in the next two days. According to the capacity of the lots, the officials will decide how much area around it can be turned a no-parking zone. The BMC will put signage and bring other machinery required to implement the rule. BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi is trying to free roads so that BEST buses can ply smoothly, encouraging more people to use public transport. In a few years, metro services will be operational in many parts of the city and he wants to ensure that people should have end-toend public transport options. \u201cEverything is interconnected. We are making BEST journeys comfortable and increasing the numbers of buses. At the same time, we are freeing the street from illegal parking so that these buses can run everywhere. It will encourage people to use more public transport and help decongest the city,\u201d the new civic commissioner said.

The extension of jurisdiction will enable MMRDA to invest in these areas and give boost to big ticket infra projects. On Thursday, the proposal was introduced in the state assembly by minister of state for urban development Yogesh Sagar while it was mooted by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in the legislative council. The cabinet had passed the proposal in February. Sources said the jurisdiction has been extended by 2,000 sq km. \"Among the projects being planned is the extension of the Dahanu railway to Vasai, the multi-modal corridor from Alibaug to Virar, the Surya dam, the Navi Mumbai airport, the development of Boisar and the extension of the trans-harbour link,\" said Sagar. As a result of the expansion in jurisdiction, MMRDA can get involved in arranging financing for the projects and even execute major schemes, he said. NCP leader Jayant Patil raised concerns about the impact on Dahanu, which falls within Palghar and is an eco-sensitive zone. \"We hope Dahanu will remain protected. It had a committee dedicated to monitoring development,\" said Patil. Congress leader Nawab Malik said the government will have to take into account the large number of unauthorised construction in the Vasai-Virar-Nalasopara belt. CM Fadnavis said: \"The expansion in the scope of MMRDA will help boost infrastructure. It had been a long-pending demand of local representatives across party lines.\" Assuring the Opposition that the special status of Dahanu will be taken into account while implementing projects, he said the move will help prevent unauthorised construction in the region. \"The local authorities, whether municipal corporations or the gram sabhas, will remain planning authorities but the area will come under the jurisdiction of MMRDA,\" the CM further explained. \"With this expansion, the MMR population will increase by 12 lakh. We will, however, get a lot of new areas that are open land with less population. These areas can be developed for creating better infrastructure,\" he stated. Fadnavis said MMRDA was involving experts in a big way. \"It is an organisation with less staff and there is need for more expertise to execute the big-ticket projects. For example, the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, which will be 22-km long, will have marvellous engineering. At the same time, we will ensure protection for biodiversity and bird sanctuary.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "BEST to slash all bus fares in Mumbai": {"datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/best-to-slash-all-bus-fares-ac-rides-to-cost-minimum-rs-6-maximum-rs-25/articleshow/69883262.cms", "time": "2019-06-21 06:29:00", "description": "MUMBAI: Commuting by BEST buses could soon get a lot cheaper. The transport undertaking has come up with a draft for fare reduction according to which the minimum fare for travel by an ordinary bus will be Rs 5 for a distance of 5km (down from Rs 15), while the minimum AC bus fare will be Rs 6 (a huge drop from Rs 30). The maximum fare proposed for travel by an ordinary bus is Rs 20, with Rs 25 being the maximum in case of AC buses. The current fares are Rs 42 and Rs 95, respectively, for a 30-km distance. The unprecedented reduction in fares, which is mainly aimed at doubling ridership from 25 lakh to 50 lakh, is the brainchild of new BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi. The recommendation has been accepted by the BEST administration, which will now table the proposal before its panel for approval. BEST business: Cheaper fares, more buses to hit share taxisBEST committee members had recently welcomed the civic chief \u2019s suggestion to reduce fares and increase the fleet by over 6,000 buses. Pardeshi had said there should be a low fare of Rs 5 for 5km, especially on feeder routes outside stations. He also suggested free rides in a radius of 2km outside Metro stations on an experimental basis, increasing buses by procuring more vehicles on wet lease, deploying AC buses on busy office routes and giving commuters a mobile app to show the expected time of arrival and help with live tracking for every bus. The BEST plans to introduce at least 200 smaller AC buses in a couple of months to woo office-goers. \u201cA total of 530 buses are expected to join the fleet by the year-end. It will ensure more buses on busy routes, improve frequency and reduce waiting time for passengers which has gone up to 45 minutes at some stops,\u201d an official said. The new fleet will include 80 electric buses, being procured with a subsidy of Rs 54 crore from the Centre. Work orders for another 1,500 buses are likely to be issued in the coming weeks, sources said. The fare proposal, if implemented, will hit share taxi business in the island city and share auto services in the suburbs. \u201cCitizens will prefer to board our buses if the fares are competitive and it will save them a lot of money in commuting every month,\u201d an official said. BEST general manager Surendrakumar Bagde said, \u201cThe department is geared to handle a huge rush of passengers once the fares drop. Passengers will get good quality new buses which will ferry them faster to their destination at affordable rates.\u201d Pardeshi said buses should be more visible, be affordable and efficient. The areas which are likely to get more AC buses include Fort, Churchgate, Nariman Point, Lower Parel, Mahalaxmi, Elphinstone Road, Dadar, Malad, Goregaon among other places.

A division bench of Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice Nitin Jamdar on Thursday issued notices to the fare fixation committee (FFC) and Maharashtra government and also sought to know when the new fares are likely to be implemented. The existing fare has four slabs-Rs 10, 20, 30 and 40-for the 11.4-km Metro route. The FFC, in its report released in March, has retained the fare of the first two slabs, but sought a Rs 5 reduction in the other two slabs-to Rs 25 and Rs 35. MMOPL said that its losses will increase if the reduced fares are implemented and claimed that FFC had not considered many relevant factors while fixing the rates. Assistant government pleader Dushyant Kumar represented the state government. The bench was informed that the new reduced fares were not implemented due to the election code of conduct. The court has scheduled further hearing of the case on August 1, and till then, the existing fares are likely to continue. A senior bureaucrat told TOI that under the law, the FFC was binding on the Metro operator. \"The new reduced fares should be implemented as soon as possible as it is in public interest,\" said the bureaucrat who did not wish to be named. In its July 2015 report, the FFC had allowed MMOPL to charge fares in the price band of Rs 10 to Rs 110. MMOPL had then proposed to increase fares by Rs 5, and proposed five slabs-Rs 10, 20, 25, 35 and 45-instead of the exisiting four. But the HC, in December 2015, stayed the hiked fares and later, in 2017, struck down the FFC report asking it to consider the matter afresh. MMOPL's justification for a fare hike has been what it claims an escalation of project costs to Rs 4,321 crore from Rs 2,356 crore. The operator had said that its demand for a viability gap fund of Rs 1,252 crore was reduced to Rs 650 crore. In 2017, the MMOPL had claimed before the court that it was suffering a loss of Rs 90 lakh per day.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Gracias and two bishops, Dominic Savio Fernandes and John Rodrigues, have filed a petition to quash a Pocso court's order of May 7, 2019 to the police to investigate whether they \"conducted any inquiry and despite having received knowledge did not give information to the police\" under section 19 of the Pocso Act. They also want a recent FIR by the Shivaji Nagar police quashed. While section 19 deals with reporting of sexual offences, section 21 (2) prescribes imprisonment up to a year if a person in charge of an institution fails to report an offence by a subordinate under his control. The priest, Fr Lawrence Johnson (52), is facing trial. In February 2019, the minor's father sought action against the trio. The petition states that the boy's father filed a complaint in respect of \"the alleged incident of November 27, 2015 on November 30, 2015. \"Therefore there was no question of again intimating the concerned police station about the alleged offence because already the police were informed and the police had already taken cognisance by registering an FIR, therefore there is no offence committed by the petitioner no 3 (Cardinal) as alleged by the complainant for non-compliance of section 19 of PocsoAct,'' it adds. The petition informs that the Cardinal directed an inquiry as soon as he received the November 30, 2015 complaint letter and learnt, a day later in Rome, that the FIR was registered. \"Therefore, the present petitioners cannot be held liable for prosecution under section 21 of PocsoAct for non-compliance of section 19.\" The petition says the trio is \"innocent\" and \"falsely implicated\" in this case.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Additional chief secretary (services) Sitaram Kunte issued a seven-page comprehensive order on the setting up of high-level review committees as well as the procedure to be followed for compulsory retirement of errant officials. Kunte also attached a one-page note on observations of the Supreme Court on compulsory retirement. The apex court has observed that compulsory retirement is neither a punishment nor a consequence of misbehavior, and that an official should be compulsorily retired only after the competent authority concludes that his retirement is in the public interest. While the provisions for compulsory retirement existed under the Maharashtra Civil Service (Pension) Rules, 1982, it was for the first time that the GAD compiled 23 orders issued between 1975 to 2010, said a bureaucrat on Thursday. \u201cThe state government has powers to compulsorily retire erring employees, but in the past four decades, very few employees were retired. Now the state government has decided to compulsorily retire non-performing employees after following the due process of law. We will compile the list of the erring employees as early as possible,\u201d the official said. The bureaucrat said that it had been proposed to compulsorily retire all those employees who were under investigation for anti-corruption or were facing serious charges of irregularities and moral turpitude. \u201cWe found that in such cases, litigation takes a long time. Under such circumstances, it was felt that government will issue a show-cause notice to such employees and then compulsorily retire them,\u201d he said. The order issued by the GAD said that all the departmental heads would have to do a review of all employees who had completed 30 years of services or had crossed the age of 50. They would have to submit to the respective departments, along with annual confidential records and recommendations, whether these employees should continue in service or should be compulsorily retired. \u201cWe have asked regional heads to set up review committees, take note of the performance of the employees. If the committee feels that an employee should be compulsorily retired in public interest or he is of doubtful integrity, then the committee should submit its report to the government,\u201d the official said. The GAD order said that before compulsorily retiring any employee, he would be issued a show-cause notice and his contention would be heard.

Although cut-offs for self-financed courses fell 1-3% in sought-after colleges, they continued to be off-limits to several students who have scored 90% and more. Among plain vanilla courses, cut-offs for FYBA dropped marginally, leaving little scope for a third list at top colleges. Considering the previous year\u2019s trend, the cut-offs are unlikely to fall drastically in the third list. CBSE and ISC students continued to beat their state board counterparts to top colleges in the second merit list too. Principals have advised students to secure admissions in colleges where they have been allotted a seat and shift if entry scores fall in their preferred institutions in the third merit list. At Mithibai College, arts cut-off was 95% in the second merit list \u2014down just 1% from the previous list. At Jai Hind College, arts saw a marginal drop from 93% to 92.67%. At St Xavier\u2019s College, merely five FYBA seats were available for state board students. Admissions closed at 92%, down from 92.3%. \u201cArts cut-offs have barely come down in the second list. For students from other boards, the drop was marginal\u2014 from 98.4% to 98%,\u201d said Rajendra Shinde, principal, St Xavier\u2019s. \u201cWe are not sure about a third list in arts,\u201d he added. At K C College, arts cut-offs fell from 93% to 91%. While all minority colleges had slightly higher cut-offs than last year, some such as Ramnarain Ruia and D G Ruparel in Matunga saw a jump after implementation of the Maratha quota. D G Ruparel had recorded 98% cut-off in the first list for FYBA while the second list was not out at the time of going to press. At Ruia, the FYBA cut-off in the second 2018 list was 89.9% and this year 94.4%. \u201cVery few seats are left in the open category after the two new quotas, leading to higher cut-offs in arts. Science aspirants can still be hopeful as many could cancel after engineering and medical admissions. Students can check for vacant seats in individual colleges even after the third list,\u201d said principal Anushree Lokur. FYBCom cut-offs, by contrast, have seen a significant 1-3% drop in top colleges and are lower than last year too. Attributing the drop to increase in seats in self-financed courses, Shobana Vasudevan, principal, R A Podar College, said there are more takers for specialized BCom courses such as BCom (accounting and finance) or BAF, BMS and BCom (banking and insurance) or BBI. \u201cSince these courses are popular, more colleges are offering them. BCom aspirants are, thus, divided among these specialized courses,\u201d she said. Science courses saw 5-15% drop and may fall more. \u201cIn general, there is a drop in scores in the second merit list, except arts. This year, the drop in the HSC success rate has led to lower cut-offs,\u201d said Rajpal Hande, principal, Mithibai College.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP.

Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state.

Ganeshotsav will be celebrated from September 2. Mandals that set up pandals on roads need an NOC from the civic body, traffic police and fire brigade. The BMC said that the process of issuing permissions to around 12,000-odd small and big mandals will be done online through a single-window system-the civic body's website. It means mandals do not need to go to the police, traffic and fire department separately for NOCs. They have to log on to www.mcgm.gov.in and fill up a form, specifying details like the name of the association's chairman, area of the mandap, landmark, local corporator's name, police station of the area among other details. The window to seek permissions has been kept open till August 19 (up to 5.30pm). However, permission to idol-makers will be issued offline when they approach their respective ward offices, said a civic official. Those seeking permission to set up a dais for Navratri festivities will also have to seek permission online through a similar process. Members of the Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti, an apex body of community pandals, welcomed the move. \"In the past, our members had to struggle with permission till the last minute and so this is a good move.

In over 10,000 cases, a quarter, the reason cited was the accused declining to marry the accuser. Maharashtra ranks second in this category, Madhya Pradesh being the first. While MP reported 1,592 such cases of rape where the person was known and had promised marriage, Maharashtra reported 1,422, beating Uttar Pradesh which at third place reported 1,195. Of the 29 states, two\u2014West Bengal and Odisha -- reported zero cases of rape due to false promise of marriage. A lawyer who handles such cases said the fact that NCRB even categorises rapes under the head \u201cKnown persons on promise to marry the victim\u201d under an umbrella title of \u201cCases where offenders were known to victims\u201d reflects the disturbing trend of rise in such cases. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court passed two judgments which please persons on both sides of such a \u2018marriage promise.\u2019 In a ruling that many hailed as one which would protect many an innocent accused of a serious offence, the SC ruled that rape cannot be invoked in cases of consensual sex after a relationship ends and the man declines to marry the woman, for whatever reason. A clear distinction has to be drawn, the apex court bench said. In April this year, the SC in another case upheld conviction of a man from Chhattisgarh in a rape case filed by the woman, who said her \u201cconsent\u201d was taken on a false promise of marriage. The SC, however, said each case has its own peculiar facts which may have a bearing on the question whether the consent was voluntary, and the SC held that in this one, the accused, \u201cfrom the very beginning never intended to marry her.\u201d The SC, however, said facts and circumstances of every case have to be probed. The SC bench of Justices A K Sikri and S Abdul Nazeer had clearly held in one case that rape charge cannot be invoked in case of consensual sex between live-in partners after the relationship ends and the man fails to marry her due to circumstances beyond his control. The bench said having consensual sex under the promise of marriage cannot be allowed to be used to initiate criminal proceedings for rape in case of breakdown of relationship, with no marriage taking place. Such cases could be termed a case of breach of promise to marry, the SC said. \u201cThere may be a case where the prosecutrix agrees to have sexual intercourse on account of her love and passion for the accused and not solely on account of misconception created by accused, or where an accused on account of circumstance which he could not have foreseen or which were beyond his control, was unable to marry her despite having every intention to do so. Such cases must be treated differently,\u201d the bench said. Often, a common thread in rape cases is of women given an intoxicant alleging they gave no legal consent for the act.

The court clarified that it had not gone into the alleged inconsistencies in the affidavits filed by the three sisters in 1985 and their later written statement and the issue could be taken up in the trial. Jivajirao Scindia, the former ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Gwalior, died on July 17, 1961, without leaving behind a will. In 1984, his wife, Vijaya Raje, filed a partition suit claiming that the properties left behind being that of a Hindu Undivided Family, should be shared 50:50 between her and her son, Madhavrao. She filed a suit in 1985 before the Pune city civil court seeking possession of her half share of the properties and claimed that the daughters had been given their share of the properties. An affidavit was filed by the daughters in 1985 supporting their mother\u2019s suit. Vijaya Raje died in January 2001 and Madhavrao died the same year in a plane crash.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

The instructions were flashed on the admission portal on Thursday, a day after filling of Part-II forms kicked off, creating confusion among students and principals. Until last year, ICSE students benefited from the \u2018best of five\u2019 formula that is applicable to SSC students too. According to a Supreme Court order passed in July 2010, the percentage for admission is based on the best five scores in the six subjects the students appeared for in groups A and B. Further Group C, from which students choose one subject, cannot be counted. ICSE students could opt for this system or calculate the percentage based on all seven subjects. On Thursday morning, though, the education department added a ticker on its portal. \u201cFor ICSE students since there is no group A, B, C on the marksheet the first five subject marks will be considered. The average percentage on the right-hand side of the marksheet for these subjects should be considered,\u201d it read. The general practice among ICSE students was to upload marks of six subjects and the system would normalize these out of 500. The ticker caught students and principals off guard. \u201cSometimes, the score of the six or seven subjects is higher than the best five score and hence students prefer to choose that option. We have been trying to get in touch with the department but haven\u2019t received any clarification on it and hence have told students to wait,\u201d said a south Mumbai school principal. The change is expected to hit the scores of the nearly 8,500 ICSE students who apply for FYJC admission. For instance, a Class X ICSE student will now have a score of 87.8% against 89.5% if he could enter the marks of all the six subjects. Education department officials justified the move. \u201cThe Supreme Court has clearly said only subjects from groups A and B are to be considered for best of five. If we must consider scores of Group C, then we must include all seven subjects and not just six,\u201d said Suvarna Kharat, joint secretary, school education department. A south Mumbai principal said art or yoga in Group C are the fourth subject on marksheets. \u201cThis would mean that scores of Group B subjects such as maths and science appear after these; science would then become the sixth subject.\u201d A principal said, \u201cWe have been using six subject scores for a few years, so we don\u2019t understand why the sudden change.\u201d At several schools, students had filled Part-II forms using the old rule before the ticker was put up.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

Similar demands have been made in the past and the government had assured action.

The move is likely to have an amplifier effect on earnings with the fleet size set to almost double from 3,337 now to over 6,000 in the coming months. \"The idea of having more buses and low fares will ensure faster transport at cheaper rates. It is a good sign for BEST which can revive its image in Mumbai,\" said transportation expert A V Shenoy. Another expert Nikhil Desai said one of the main reasons why BEST went into losses and witnessed a huge drop in commuters was the increase in minimum fare to Rs 8. Many realised that travelling by a bus would cost Rs 4 per km while a ride in a petrol two-wheeler would cost Rs 1.5per km. \"It was around that time that many took easy-EMI loans and bought bikes and scooters for short-distance travel, especially on feeder routes,\" he pointed out. In fact, the commuter strength had dropped drastically from over 30 lakh to less than 26 lakh. \"If there are more buses on road arriving at good frequency, it will make the service reliable. At the same time, it will strengthen the public transport system, especially when there are plans to have dedicated corridors - like on the coastal road,\" said another expert. Desai added that the decision to wet lease buses will help curtail losses. Experts said fare reduction will encourage more office-goers to opt for public transport. \"In some European countries, there are free rides in buses. If we give the same in Mumbai, many will take a bus,\" another expert said.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Noorani had been suffering from a heart related disease for the last ten months before he succumbed to a cardiac arrest last week. Noorani is survived by his wife Salma and two daughters Aliya (41) and Asma (38). Born in Mumbai, Noorani grew up on Mohammed Ali Road and was 15 years old when he joined his father in running their family-owned teashop inside the Haji Ali Dargah and was in his twenties when with the help of his sister Aziza, set up the juice centre just outside the holy shrine at Mahalaxmi. In a city now brimming with hipster detox juice bars in every corner, Noorani was among the first to shake up a spectacular range of fresh juices squeezed out of seasonal fruits and veggies, flavoured milkshakes and kulfi faloodas. He innovated by bringing on its menu exotic offerings \u2013 New Zealand cherries and plums, wild berries, muesli, broccoli, star anise, cinnamon and even mogra flowers as the humble juice stall briskly matured into one of Mumbai\u2019s most popular street food joints that also found mention in Suketu Mehta\u2019s Maximum City, an award winning book that offered an insider\u2019s view of the metropolis. A pure vegetarian place, Noorani had designed the menu of the juice centre with pilgrims of both the Dargah and the Mahalaxmi temple in mind and in 1984 went on to set up Caf\u00e9 Noorani across the road to serve the meat-eating masses. Popular by night as much as by day, Noorani seemed to know many of his patrons by name and it was an eclectic assortment \u2013 actors, artists, politicians, local business owners and neighbourhood families. Actor Salman Khan once famously lamented on Twitter and drew attention to the Juice Centre when he found the shop shut after midnight. The daughters have taken over the reins of what their father built with Asma, the younger one now running the Juice Centre and their longstanding tea shop at the Dargah while the elder one Aliya is looking after Cafe Noorani. \u201cIt was by choice because we know how passionate he was about creating a brand out of something ordinary,\u201d said Asma as she recalled: \u201cUntil ten months ago when he took ill, he would rise with the sun and spend time in all his establishments every day, quietly helping out anyone who came to him seeking monetary help to support their child\u2019s education or medical treatment.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Nagpur BJP Candidate List": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections-2019/maharashtra/news/after-withdrawals-116-candidates-in-race-for-7-seats-in-first-phase/articleshow/68621605.cms", "time": "", "description": "NAGPUR: After deadline for withdrawal for the first phase of Lok Sabha polls, 31 out of 147 candidates, whose nomination papers were found valid in seven constituencies of Vidarbha, have withdrew their papers.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The hospital employees went on a flash strike from 7am in protest and brought OPD as well as emergency services to a halt, said a patient's relative. Late on Wednesday, Himani Sharma (29), a BPO employee, approached Bangur Nagar police with a complaint that she had been harassed and assaulted. She was in an inebriated state. The police took her to the hospital for a check-up and the drama began at the emergency ward around 5.30am. Police sources said an argument broke out following which Sharma hit a nurse and then a doctor. \"She grew violent and the hospital staff alerted us,\" said an officer from Kandivli police station. \"When a female constable, Mhatre, went there, Sharma assaulted her too. After a hospital staffer lodged a complaint against her, Sharma was arrested.\" Sharma also vandalised the hospital.  Dr Pradeep Angre, medical superintendent of the hospital, said Sharma used abusive language and scratched those who tried to calm her down. \"It took a while for the doctors to sedate her. She was later referred for psychiatric counselling,\" he said. Angre said hospital services were not disrupted, but patie- nts' relatives said the staffers cl- osed the entrance. \"Patients we- re stranded for hours. Even pre- gnant women were not allowed inside,\" said Khalid Siddique, a local. Services were normalised only after 11am following a series of meetings between the employees and BMC higher-ups. \"Doctors across India are feeling threatened.
