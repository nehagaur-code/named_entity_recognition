Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The Patna high court division bench of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Anjana Mishra made the verbal remark while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Vikash Chandra alias Guddu Baba. The court, while taking strong exception to the issue, suggested the authorities concerned to settle the vendors encroaching upon public roads in front of the residences of ministers so that people could be spared of their sufferings. The petitioner had urged the court to direct the authorities concerned to get rid of roadside encroachments on Ashok Rajpath, Bari Path, Hathua and Lalji markets and the stretch between Pataliputra Colony and Digha road. These encroachments, according to the petitioner, lead to massive traffic snarls in the city. The high court asked the state government to file a counter affidavit by Monday, informing it about the current status of construction of vending zones and settlement of roadside encroachers. The court slammed the government for reappearance of encroachers on roads due to lack of proper vending zones for them.

Dr Gopal Shankar Sahni, head of paediatrics department at SKMCH, said several teams of experts and doctors from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi, National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, and All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi and Patna have come to Muzaffarpur to study the cases and find the cause of AES, which has been occurring during peak summer and pre-monsoon season in the north Bihar district since 1994-95. Incidentally, most of these agencies and organizations had conducted studies on the disease in the past as well. \u201cThey are taking blood, urine and throat sob samples of the affected children. Besides, they will be studying the profile of the victims and their food habits, common places of occurrence of the disease, among others,\u201d Dr Sahni told TOI on Tuesday. He said researchers have so far failed to reach any conclusion. He attributed the disease to extreme heat and humidity. \u201cThe AES outbreak mostly happened when the maximum temperature remained above 38 degrees C and humidity was in the range of 60-70% and above,\u201d he said. Patna-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) doctor has suggested brain biopsy and tissue culture of the victims to know the cause of AES deaths. \u201cFollowing the inspection of SKMCH by Union health minister recently, the state government had asked IGIMS to suggest steps for finding the cause of the disease. Based on a detailed study and deliberations on researches done by agencies across the globe on the disease in Muzaffarpur, we have recommended brain biopsy in death cases and brain tissue biopsy in case of fever,\u201d IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal told TOI. He said majority of the researches have been based on blood samples only. Doctors at SKMCH, however, claimed the studies conducted in the past were not based on blood samples only. \u201cThe researches conducted by the NIV-Pune, NCDC and CDC-Atlanta between 2011 and 2013 were based on a number of samples, including blood, urine, cerebrospinal sasal fluid, rectal sob, nasal sob and throat secretin. NIV, in fact, had conducted even brain biopsy in one case. However, no virus was found to be the cause of the disease in any of the studies and viral encephalitis was ruled out. The studies put the disease in the category of non-inflammatory encephalopathy,\u201d Dr Sahni said. On being asked why brain biopsy was not done in suspected AES cases, Dr Sahni said: \u201cBiopsy and other forms of autopsies are done only in the case of unnatural deaths. However, the AES deaths are natural due to some disease,\u201d he said. The other researches on the AES, locally known as \u2018Chamki Bukhar (high fever with seizure)\u2019, include those published in journals of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta and The Lancet Global Health medical journal in 2017. Different studies and researches have blamed different causes of the disease, including malnourishment, binge-eating litchi on empty stomach and even heatstroke. Muzaffarpur-based Dr Arun Shah, who is a member of national executive committee of the Indian Paediatrics Association, said the CDC study had attributed the disease to acute hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, which is caused due to extreme low level of blood glucose in the body. \u201cUnder-nutrition is a common trend observed in most of the children suffering from the AES as they belong to poor families. The CDC, in its recommendations, had advised parents of the area not to allow their children to venture out in the orchards and feed them properly before going to sleep,\u201d said Dr Shah. Parents of several victims also accepted under-nutrition. Nunu Mahto, who lost his 4-year-old son Prince on June 10 due to AES, said his son had consumed nothing on June 7 night. He was convulsing next morning. \u201cWe tried to admit him to Kanti primary health centre, but they did not respond. Finally, we took him to SKMCH where he died,\u201d Nunu said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

With temperatures in several districts around 43 degrees Celsius, hospitals are inundated with people suffering from heatstroke. Schools in the state will remain closed until June 23.

And the villagers are exasperated with the media focus on \"lychee deaths\".  \"When we know that lychees could kill our children, why would we let them eat them? Would we not be extra cautious to ensure that our children don't eat them?\" asks Mohammed Zafrul, who sells chicken in Raksa village. Another interjects that it was possible that if both parents worked as labourers, unsupervised children, especially of those living near or working on the lychee orchards might have eaten the fruit. They insist, however, that cases of AES from their own village do not fall into this category. Mohammed Sharif Alam, who sells cloth in the village, lost his two-and-a-half-year old son to AES. \"Seeing all the news of deaths and AES over the years supposedly caused by lychee, why would any parent allow their children to eat lychee?\" asks Alam. \"Neither do we live near lychee farms, nor is he old enough to go by himself or with other kids to get them from orchards,\" he adds.  There is general relief in the area that there were \"only four deaths\" on Thursday, a sign of just how fatalistic people have become when it comes to this annual scourge. They are all hoping the lower number of deaths on Thursday signals the beginning of the end of this year's spell of deaths from AES.  But villagers are miffed that people don't seem to believe them when they say, \"forget lychee for children, we have stopped buying lychees even for adults or letting them eat lychees. We are just not willing to take that risk.\" While media has been highlighting the lack of awareness in the villages and arguing that awareness campaigns could have prevented the sudden spurt in AES cases, villagers are exasperated with 'experts' and the media refusing to accept that families no longer allow children to eat lychees.  Their own conviction is that the deaths have to do with the unrelenting heat. Meena chokes up and walks away asserting firmly that her daughter did have dinner the night before she was hospitalised.

The village, around 25 km north of the district headquarters town Hajipur, has already lost 10 children due to Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES), which has acquired alarming proportions across the state. More than 30 families, mostly belonging to the fishermen community, have abandoned their homes and shifted to their relatives\u2019 houses out of fear of the deadly brain fever, also called \u2018chamki bukhar\u2019. Only old ones, widows or those who can\u2019t walk due to physical disability are in the village having a population of around 600. The village, once humming with activities, now wears a deserted look. Big locks can be found hanging at the doors of most of the houses in the village. One Chaturi Sahni, (45), a resident of the village, said on Thursday, \u201cI have lost two members of my family due to the AES. My wife Chanchal Devi is speechless ever since she lost her two kids within 24 hours. It\u2019s a double shocker for the family. She has stopped taking meal ever since the incident happened.\u201d Sahni, a cook by profession, however, blamed the district administration in particular and the state government in general for his two sons\u2019 death. \u201cI had no money to take my seven-year-old son and another 18 month-old them to the sadar hospital at Hajipur after their condition deteriorated. I had to take loan from my brother Sushil Sahni to hire an auto-rickshaw to take both my ailing sons to the hospital for treatment. But none of them survived. While Sahni was busy in preparation for the funeral of his elder son, the news about his second son\u2019s death came. Two deaths at short intervals have virtually shaken the family from within. Later, I decided to shift my family to my in-laws house at neighbouring Bilanpur village in Vaishali district out of fear,\u201d he added. The ordeal of another resident Rajesh Kumar (34), is far from over. \u201cI have lost my seven-year-old son Shravan Kumar. I decided to shift my family to my relative\u2019s house due to apprehension of losing my second son, who is only three-and-a half-years old. I have suggested my wife to stay there for a few weeks till the situation improves,\u201d Rajesh, who is a farmer, said. Ahilya Devi (40) is so shocked that she only stares at the visitors. \u201cKee hoyale hayee. Gaon mein bheer kahe hayee (What has happened? Why so many people are here?),\u201d she asked her nephew Santosh Sahni. Santosh (25) tried to convince her that everything is fine and there is nothing to worry. Locals said that more than 10 children below the age of 10 are still undergoing treatment either at Hajipur sadar hospital or SKMCH in Muzaffarpur. Vaishali district magistrate Rajiv Raushan, however, confirmed the death of only six children from Harivanshpur village. \u201cWe are aware of the tragedy, which struck the village. The officials of the district administration are camping there and keeping a close watch. A medical team is also camping in the village. Besides, an ambulance has been provided to take the patients to the hospital,\u201d he added. Potable water is being supplied to the village through tankers. Sanitation work has also started and people are being made aware about the AES by Asha workers. Prohibitory orders under section 144 have already been clamped asking people to avoid moving out in the scorching sun between 11 pm and 5 pm. Schools, colleges and other educational institutes have been closed as a precautionary measure, the DM said. In addition, ORS packets are being distributed among the residents of the village. The DM said that three blocks\u2014Bhagwanpur, Vaishali and Lalganj\u2014which are close to Muzaffarpur, have been identified as worst hit. Till date 15 deaths have been reported from the district. However, one case each from Mahua, Janadaha and Chehrakalan blocks have also been reported, he added. Block-level officials have been directed to launch sanitation work on a priority basis. \u201cPeople are being made aware of the hygienic condition,\u201d the DM said. On the other hand, a senior official said that some of the parents turned up with their kids for medical examination on Thursday. But they left for their relatives houses soon after the check up in the village. The officials tried to convince them to stay in their houses but in vain. \u201cAbhi yahan rahne mein jaan ko kahtra hai (Life is under threat now),\u201d one of the residents told the official.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

Dariapur in Kanti block of Muzaffarpur has dalit and mahadalit population. It has been one of the worst affected villages in the district. The village with a population of hardly 3000 people lacks basic infrastructure even when the government claims all-round development up to hamlets level. Subodh Paswan, whose daughter Nidhi (5) died due to AES earlier this month, blamed lack of medical facilities at local public health centre (PHC). \u201cWe took Nidhi to the PHC but they refused to admit her and referred her to SKMCH where she was declared dead. The doctors at SKMCH said her life could have been saved had she been brought a bit earlier,\u201d Paswan said. Sanjay Kumar, another resident of Dariyapur, said the PHC remains open only for three to four days in a month. \u201cComplaints have been lodged with the block officials, but in vain,\u201d he added. Similar was the situation in Damodari, Ramur Sah and other villages from where majority of the AES cases have been reported. Most villagers are either daily wagers or agricultural labourers. Most children seldom go to the nearby Anganwadi centres as they remain open for hardly a couple of days in a month. So, they are deprived of nutritional foods supposed to be distributed through these centres. People have now started preventing their kids from going out in scorching heat, fearing fatal consequences. Even children and parents from urban pockets are apprehensive about the disease. \u201cWe are not sure whether this disease will affect our children or not as no urban locality has been hit by AES so far. We are taking precautionary measures and have asked our children not to go out in scorching heat unless necessary,\u201d said Prabhakar Kumar, a resident of Brahmin Toli under the Town police station area of Muzaffarpur. But, in rural areas of the district, every second family is afraid of getting their ward sick and keeps children indoors. \u201cWe try our best to not let our wards move out during day time. We are also trying to ensure that our children must not go to the litchi orchards,\u201d said Sakal Paswan of Dariapur Kafen under the Kanti police station area. Also, the tall claims of district health officials of providing manpower and infrastructure to the PHCs and additional PHCs along with referral hospitals of the district seem hollow as majority of the 16 PHCs are reeling from acute shortage of medical experts, nursing staff, apart from beds and other facilities, including medicines. The deadly disease, which was first reported in Bihar at Muzaffarpur in 1994-95, has spread its wings to neighbouring districts of Sitamarhi, Sheohar, East Champaran, West Champaran, Vaishali and Samastipur as well.

Health officials conceded that none of the kids, who have survived the deadly \u2018chamki bukhar\u2019 or are undergoing treatment, has been provided assistance under Ayushman Bharat \u2014 a flagship scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY). A senior official in the state health department confirmed that treatment of AES can be covered under the scheme. PMJAY, launched during the first term of the Modi government, provides an annual health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family to nearly 50 crore people from 10.74 crore \u2018deprived\u2019 families selected on the basis of socio-economic and caste census data. Bihar government\u2019s Mukhya Mantri Chikitsa Sahayta Kosh Yojna is also aimed at providing monetary assistance to the poor for medical treatment of the disease. However, both these initiatives failed to come to the rescue. Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Shailesh Prasad Singh told TOI on Wednesday that no applications of AES patients were received either at the state government- run Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) or the trust-run Krishnadevi Deviprasad Kejriwal Maternity Hospital. G S Sahni, head of pediatrics department at SKMCH, said treatment of AES cases is covered under both the central and the state schemes.  \u201cSKMCH as well as KDKMH are listed under Ayushman Bharat scheme along with all 16 primary health centres (PHCs) two additional PHCs, two referral hospitals in the district are listed Ayushman Bharat scheme,\u201d he said, adding that 10 private hospitals in the district are also enlisted listed for treating people under the central scheme. Incidentally, none of the private hospitals listed under Ayushman Bharat scheme have pediatric intensive care units and only two of them have general ICUs. Relatives of a number of children admitted at SKMCH and KDKMH claimed that they have not even been issued the health cards under Ayushman Bharat scheme. \u201cWe have not been issued health card for getting treated under Ayushman Bharat scheme. Hence, we have not applied for it,\u201d said Poona Devi, whose son Raushan Raj (5) succumbed to the deadly disease on June 14. Devi is a resident of Dariapur Kafen village under Kanti block of the district. On being asked about getting the ailing children treated at the ICUs of private hospitals, Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh said it cannot be done due to technical and administrative issues. \u201cWe cannot shift the children from PICUs of SKMCH to any private hospital because it will create chaos at management level. If any death occurs at those hospitals, we cannot fix the responsibility on anyone. Even having an eye of treatment procedure at those private hospitals would be a hectic and lengthy task. So, we are not preferring to shift the children to a private nursing home,\u201d Ghosh said. The DM added that it has also been observed that the Matrisadan hospital has been referring the cases to SKMCH in the eleventh hour. \u201cIt becomes very difficult to save the life of the kid, when they are referred to SKMCH in critical condition,\u201d Ghosh said. Health experts also claimed that the outbreak of the disease also showed failure of the state and central government to spread awareness about its prevention. \u201cAES has been occurring from over past two decades and few common causes have been identified as low glucose level and malnutrition and its occurrence in peak summer season. But the disease still claimed lives of over 100 children, this year. This shows that the authorities utterly failed to create even awareness about the disease,\u201d said Sanjay Kumar, secretary of Patna chapter of IMA.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Non-functional fans, emergency beds for patients in the veranda and three infants on one bed in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a common sight in the paediatric department of PMCH at a time when acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) has claimed lives of hundreds of children in the state. With her 21-month old child Isha Kumari in her lap, Guddi Kumari from Nagarnausa in Nalanda district was among many parents getting their kids treated in the veranda of PMCH. Guddi was sitting in a corner of the veranda with no fan near her even though her daughter was suffering from high fever. \u201cThe nurses are very rude here,\u201d she alleged. The PMCH superintendent, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, however, defended the hospital administration. \u201cWe purchased new fans recently. One or two fans may not be working and they will be replaced soon,\u201d he added. A doctor at the PMCH paediatrics department, however, rued the shortage of beds. \u201cWe can treat patients. Making beds available is the responsibility of the government,\u201d he added. The head of PMCH\u2019s paediatrics department, Dr Anil Kumar Jaiswal, said there are 210 beds in the paediatrics ward of PMCH, 52 in the NICU and 16 in the ICU, including 10 beds for AES patients.

The NMCH staff said more than 100 children visit the outpatient department of the hospital daily with AES symptoms.

While over 112 children below the age of 10 years died due to suspected Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) in Muzaffarpur and its adjoining districts in north Bihar, more than 90 people lost their lives due to heatstroke in Aurangabad, Gaya, Nawada and Jamui districts in south and central Bihar. However, the unofficial records show much high casualties in the two separate tragedies. The situation can be gauged from the fact that only 3.94% of the state\u2019s total expenditure is for health, which is the second lowest after Haryana. On the contrary, its neighbouring state Uttar Pradesh spends 5.07% of its total expenditure on healthcare. Moreover, the per capita expenditure on health is lowest in the state at Rs.495 compared to Rs 733 in Uttar Pradesh, the third lowest in the country. According to authoritative sources, there are 11,373 sanctioned posts of doctors in the state. But almost 50% of the posts are still vacant. The magnitude of the problem can be gauged from the fact that only one doctor was on duty when people with complaints of heatstroke started rushing to the Aurangabad sadar hospital for treatment last week. Statistics available with the health department revealed that only 12 doctors were serving at Aurangabad sadar hospital against sanctioned strength of 45. Similarly, 16% of the sanctioned strength of the doctors were posted in Sitamarhi district, which is in the grip of AES. The situation is no better in Patna, Vaishali and Bhojpur districts. Till date 41 people have died due to heatstroke in Aurangabad followed by 35 in Gaya, 12 in Nawada and two in Jamui districts. Majority of the deceased were above the age of 60 years. Former chief secretary of united Bihar V S Dubey said, \u201c It\u2019s a fact the state's budget in health sector is very low compared to other states. But what is more important is that whatever the infrastructure the state has, is not being utilized properly and effectively. The result is obvious. It\u2019s high time the government should take notice of it and improve the condition accordingly.\u201d Dubey expressed concern over doctors\u2019 strike on one pretext or the other. \u201c There have been instances when relatives and attendants of patients were assaulted by doctors in the government hospitals for asking for proper care of their patients. On the other hand, doctors are too beaten up by the attendants. It\u2019s two way. It shouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d he added. Referring to the AES deaths in Muzaffarpur and its adjoining districts, the ex-chief secretary said over 1000 children have died in the state ever since the brain fever or \u2018chamki bukhar\u2019 was detected in the state in 1994-95. The situation has not improved even today and children belonging to lower strata are dying everyday. State health minister Mangal Pandey admitted that there was dearth of doctors in government hospitals. He, however, said that appointment of around 1000 medical officers, 2200 specialist doctors, 6300 ANMs and 558 dentists was on the cards. \u201cCertain changes have been brought about in the appointment/selection rules to expedite the process,\u201d he said. \u201cEarlier, all appointments in the health department were made through the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC), which is already over burdened with lots of vacancies in different government departments. Now, the Bihar Technical Service Commission (BTSC) has been set up by the government for appointment of doctors, medical officers and other employees health department,\u201d Pandey said. Besides, efforts were on to improve the infrastructure as well. Three new medical colleges in Purnia, Chhapra (Saran) and Samastipur would be set up in the state soon.

Even as the state government blames hypoglycemia as the cause for most deaths, doctors, public health experts and researchers have raised concerns over the government's failure to contain the rapidly rising death toll from the disease. More than 112 children have died due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in the past fortnight and many more are feared infected in Muzaffarpur and the adjoining districts in Bihar. This has also compelled the Union health ministry to send different teams to probe and ascertain the exact cause, strengthen surveillance and measures in the affected districts. Ten paediatricians (including five senior consultants) and five para-medics from RML Hospital, Safdarjung and Lady Hardinge Medical College are part of the five teams set up by health ministry. The teams also include clinical and public health experts from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), National Institute of Nutrition and UN agencies. \"As of now, we do not have much clue about the exact cause of these deaths. However, we are working on several possibilities and are hopeful of zeroing on it in a day or two,\" a senior official from ICMR told TOI. Experts say there can be a clutch of factors causing AES including viruses, bacteria, fungus, parasites, chemicals, toxins and non-infectious agents. Though litchis are being seen as a primary cause, researchers say the fruit can only be a contributing factor and not the cause. Instead, prolonged malnourishment, the current heat wave, poor hygiene and lack of awareness about litchi consumption may have led to the significant number of deaths among children, mainly less than five year old. \"Litchi cannot be the cause. There is a particular component in the fruit which can contribute to reducing blood sugar level if too many litchis are consumed in an empty stomach,\" said a public health expert working in Muzaffarpur. Official data suggest the Bihar government has been indifferent towards improving child nutrition and healthcare in this district. In Muzaffarpur, nearly 48% children under the age of 5 are stunted, 17.5% are wasted (too thin for their height), while 42% are underweight--a glaring sign of chronic undernutrition, according to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4. The data also show merely 7.8% children aged 6-23 months receive an adequate diet in Muzaffarpur. While breastfeeding rates are better, the breastfeeding rate in the first hour of birth is poor. Moreover, maternal health indicators are also poor leading to inadequate nutrition for the child despite improving rate of breastfeeding. Every third women (15-49 years) in Muzaffarpur district is malnourished, having body mass index (BMI) below the normal level. Government reports show that 33% women in this age group in Muzaffarpur district are underweight. Experts also pointed at the poor health infrastructure as another major factor leading to deaths. \"Delay in care seeking is also a major factor for increasing number of deaths. There is lack of information and awareness. Patients from villages are rushing to town to seek treatment at tertiary care and losing time in the process. If they go to the nearest health centre or clinic, they can get immediate care and the situation can be controlled,\" another expert with an international health agency said. He added, encephalitis fever usually starts during night and by morning the symptoms are severe, once the fever reaches the brain and damages it, the situation is difficult to tackle even in tertiary care hospitals. So, it is imperative to access care at the earliest.

The CM, who is under constant attack due to his delayed visit to Muzaffarpur to see the AES patients, was in Gaya today to assess the arrangements for treatment of the heatwave victims at the Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital (ANMMCH) where he later held a meeting with the senior officials. Nitish was accompanied by his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi. The CM sought to know from the officials concerned as to why the intensity of heatwave was felt more in Aurangabad, Gaya and Nawada districts from where most of the cases were reported since June 15. He directed the officials to set up a special team to find out the reason behind it and take necessary action. Briefing the media after the review meeting, Magadh division commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pal said the CM has asked the officials concerned to check the level of surface water and green cover in the three worst affected districts. He also directed the officials to set up a team to ascertain the exact number of victims and provide them compensation. The members of the team would ascertain whether the people brought dead to the ANMCH or other government-run hospitals in the region died due to sunstroke or some other reasons. Those admitted to the ANMCH were being treated free of cost. Nitish also announced to increase the number of beds in ANMCH. \u201cFifty more beds will be provided to heatwave victims, taking the total number of beds in the hospital to 150,\u201d the divisional commissioner said, adding that such patients should be kept in a separate ward. During an hour-long review meeting, Nitish directed the principal secretary, health department, Sanjay Kumar Singh to prepare a proposal to upgrade the ANMCH to 1000-bed hospital. The CM also took stock of the arrangements for treatment of heatwave victims at Aurangabad and Nawada-based hospitals. The ongoing work on tap water supply in rural areas under seven resolve of the state government was also reviewed at the meeting. He was also apprised of the preventive measures taken by the district officials to contain the spread of Japanese Encephalitis in the region. The officials told the CM had vaccination drive had already been launched in the affected villages. The divisional commissioner said that there was no death of doctors at the ANMCH. \u201cThe strength of the doctors at the ANMCH is sufficient to deal with the patients,\u201d Pal told reporters in Gaya. Earlier, in the day the CM\u2019s aerial survey of the worst affected districts was cancelled. A woman identified as Khairunisha, a resident of Katahi Hill in Gaya district, died in the hospital ahead of the VIP\u2019s visit.On Monday Gaya district magistrate, Abhishek Singh, imposed Section 144 in the district keeping in mind the prevailing heatwave condition.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

It pointed out that mortality from AES usually ranges from 6-19% in good centres and that mortality was directly proportional to the quality of care the child received at a health facility. In SKMCH, the data shows, mortality rate has been about 25% this year. The central team pointed out that of the 58 children who were admitted to Kejriwal Hospital in Muzaffarpur, there were 7 deaths, or a mortality rate of just 12%. The report listed all the facilities missing in the SKMCH PICU. \"Neuroimaging CT Head/MRI facilities should be readily accessible. Presently MRI is not present and CT facility are provided on PPP (public private partnership) mode and patients are not referred for CT scan,\" stated the report. The report observed that nine ventilators were present but not made operational at SKMCH and no ventilators were present in Kejriwal Hospital. It added that current manpower were \"inadequate in quantity and quality\" to handle the situation. The team advised better protocol-based management of AES to bring down mortality, improved use of case monitoring sheets and better prioritising of serious and not-so-serious cases to ensure optimal use of resources. It has also recommended constituting a research team from the National Centre for Disease Control, Indian Council for Medical Research, AIIMS Patna, National Institute of Virology, Pune and Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna to focus research not only on the children who have been admitted with AES but also others within the same geographical area to understand the risks. On the speculation that there may be a link with lychee, the report said that while earlier studies had inferred that this may be connected to the presence of a specific toxin in the fruit, \"the work was not sufficient to prove that the toxin is causative for all cases\".

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar.

He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

State\u2019s agriculture minister Prem Kumar, rural development minister Shravan Kumar, industries minister Shyam Rajak, cooperative minister Rana Randhir, development commissioner Subhash Sharma and finance secretary S Siddhartha were present at the meeting, which is usually held after a gap of three months. Being the first SLBC meet of 2019-20, it was scheduled to be addressed by CM Nitish Kumar, but he could not attend it because of his participation in another meeting convened by PM Narendra Modi on the \u2018One Nation-One Election\u2019 issue. Later, while briefing media persons, Modi said majority of bank branches in the state were not accepting coins from traders. He said the banks must accept the coins. \u201cI will raise this issue at the state finance ministers\u2019 meet in Delhi on June 21,\u201d SuMo said. He also pointed out that as per the RBI guidelines, loans under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme would be provided to only those farmers whose crops are insured under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. \u201cBut, Bihar government has launched its own scheme, namely Bihar Rajya Fasal Sahayata Yojana, to provide financial assistance to farmers. There should be no compulsion for farmers to join any scheme for availing the loan under the KCC,\u201d he said.

With the increasing popularity of multiplayer online games such as PUBG (Players Unknown Battleground) in the city, mental health professionals have sounded the alarm bells. Gaming addiction is as real and dangerous as drug addiction, they say. The impact of these violent games, with high-quality graphic imagery, on the mental health of youngsters, especially children and teenagers, has forced even the World Health Organization (WHO) to take note. The WHO last month designated \u2018gaming disorder\u2019 as illness and updated its International Classification of Diseases (ICD) to include it in the list of modern diseases. Neuro-psychiatrist Rakesh Kumar says he is seeing a steady rise in number of young people, between the ages of 15 and 19, coming to him. Some of them even have suicidal tendencies as they feel they are worthless because they lost a few matches of these online games. Kumar cited the case of Class X student, who went into depression because of continuously losing while playing PUBG. He was playing more than four hours every day for the past 6 months and whenever he lost he locked himself in his room and wouldn\u2019t come out for hours. Thankfully, his parents spotted the changes in his behavior and brought him for counseling. Another case that came to him was that of an undergraduate student who had suicidal thoughts because no one was ready to play the game with him, which led him to believe he was worthless and the only thought that came to his mind was of dying. War games such as PUBG are facing severe criticism from mental health professionals in the city for being an unhealthy obsession among youngsters. The game has too much violence, they say. Satyajeet Singh, neuropsychiatrist at AIIMS, Patna says, \u201cAlmost every day, 4 to 5 parents come to my clinic purely with the complaint of excessive use of mobiles by their kids even as young as 5 for over involvement in social media and games. It is toxic for personal relationships. Many of the children are either in depression or have just disconnected themselves from the outer world.\u201d  \u201cAnything that works on the brain that produces pleasure is addictive. It causes release of a neuro chemical called dopamine, which is a centre of drug of abuse causes,\u201d he explains. City parents appear to be at a loss about how to deal with gaming addiction of their kids, which is creating a challenge for them to focus on their career and health. Sujita Singh, mother of an 18-year-old PUBG addict says, \u201cMy son has been playing PUBG for the past 3 months and it has resulted in decline in his academics. The game should be banned as soon as possible for the welfare of teenagers.\u201d Another parent, Reena Mishra, says, \u201cMy son\u2019s addiction to PUBG day after day is increasing. I am scared that he might ruin his life because of the game. I hate it when I see him playing this game.\u201d Mental health experts suggest that parents should keep an alert eye on their children and should not hesitate to seek professional help if needed. \u201cEducation, awareness and recognition are the first steps to checking this epidemic. Practicing yoga, exercises and meditation are now forgotten arts for adolescents, although India used to be the home of all of the above,\u201d says Singh of AIIMS advising parents to seek help when needed. \u201cPlay this game as a time pass but do not make it into an addiction. Play it when you need refreshment. Since it is a game, and therefore, meant for relaxation, one should not overindulge oneself in playing it,\u201d he cautions.

Even as more and more cases are being brought in to the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital in Muzaffarpur, where bulk of the patients are undergoing treatment, the hospital continues to be hampered by lack of proper facilities despite high-profile visits by ministers, including the CM and the Union health minister. TimesViewLittle children dying or suffering permanent brain damage is always a human tragedy, but when official apathy and neglect contirbute to it, that is criminal dereliction of duty. Bihar has seen these deaths happen year after year even if the numbers have in one year gone down and in another shot up. Muzaffarpur has been the epicentre. Given those facts, it is just inexcusable that the government has failed so miserably in ensuring the public health set-up is equipped to cope. Grand schemes count for little if they are of no help to poor families losing their little ones. Of course, tackling this disease needs more than just good PHCs or hospitals. As long as malnutrition is rampant, the problem will remain. To root it out, therefore, adequate nutrition is the first step. But that does not preclude effective medical intervention to ensure that the loss of lives is kept to the minimum if not eliminated altogether.Scarcity of beds and doctors coupled with unhygienic condition prevailed at the hospital even as the Bihar State Health Society issued a list of 15 doctors, technicians and nurses, who have been deputed by the Union health ministry to assist at the hospital in Muzaffarpur. \u201cAll 637 beds, including 30 in PICUs, in the hospital are full. We have to put two kids on one bed to accommodate more children,\u201d SKMCH superintendent Sunil Kumar Shahi said. He admitted that there is a shortage of senior resident doctors in every department. \u201cThough there is a shortage, it is inhuman to throw out patients just because we cannot accommodate them. Many of them have come from far-flung villages of north Bihar. Around 40 to 50 new cases of AES \u2026 come every day. But our resources are very limited.\u201d To ease the situation, a makeshift paediatrics intensive care unit with 20 new beds and four new ACs were set up on Wednesday amid frequent power cuts. Hospital authorities said 154 children are undergoing treatment for AES at the three PICUs with 10 beds each with fresh cases coming in from neighbouring districts. In Vaishali, civil surgeon I D Ranjan claimed that 15 suspected cases of AES have been reported from Hajipur as well. \u201cSeveral kids have died in their villages, while others died in the referral hospital before being diagnosed. However, their relatives claimed that they showed similar symptoms of high fever and convulsion among others,\u201d Ranjan told TOI. In Samastipur, at least three of the seven infants with AES symptoms admitted to the Sadar hospital, were referred to SKMCH, one of whom died on the way. However, civil surgeon Siyaram Mishra denied admitting any AES patients at the hospital. Meanwhile, the death of 2-year old child at a village in Katoria block of Banka district due to suspected AES raised alarm in the health department. However, To cope with the situation in Muzaffarpur, DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh has cancelled the leave of all government employees in the district. \u201cThe total number of affected and admitted children has gone up to 5,530 since June 1 this year alone. Though, 187 kids have been discharged from the hospital; 101 children are still undergoing treatment at two medical institutions of the district. The conditions of 24 children are critical and have been kept on ventilators,\u201d Ghosh said. \u201cA massive awareness campaign has been started in all blocks with the help of Jiveeka associates and aanganwadi sevikas and sahayeekaa.

She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

Poverty-induced malnutrition has been identified as one of the main causes of AES deaths in Muzaffarpur and neighbouring districts as most victims of this disease have been found to be from Dalit and Mahadalit communities. According to a National Family Health Survey, Bihar has around 27 lakh children under the age of five who suffer from \u2018acute malnutrition\u2019 and nine lakh of them are under the \u2018severe acute malnutrition\u2019 category. \u201cMalnutrition is a serious issue in Bihar, which aggravates this disease. For instance, high level of stunting has been found among kids less than five years in the affected districts, including Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, Vaishali and East Champaran,\u201d said Rabi Parhi, nutrition specialist, UNICEF- Bihar. Acknowledging the lack of sufficient nutrition in AES-affected children, the Integrated Child Development Services (IDCS) wing of the state health department issued an advisory on Thursday. The advisory outlines steps, which includes providing nutritional supplements, to be taken by anganwadi sevikas and other officials for prevention of the disease. It also lays out dos and don\u2019ts while dealing with cases of suspected AES. The ICDS provides nutrition and health services for children under the age of six and pregnant or breastfeeding women, as well as preschool activities for children age 3-5 years. These services are provided through community-based anganwadi centres. \u201cWe have endorsed the advisory issued by the health department on AES to all district programme managers and Anganwadi Sevilkas to take the required steps,\u201d ICDS director Alok Kumar told TOI on Thursday. He, however, said that malnutrition has not been directly linked with AES. But Muzaffarpur- based senior paediatrician Arun Shah, who is also a member of the national executive committee of the Indian Paediatrics Association, has attributed malnutrition as one of the main causes behind the spread of the disease. \u201cIn a sudden fall of glucose (known as hypoglycaemia in medical parlance) in human body, it is automatically supplied by the reserved glucose in the body. A malnourished child has no such reserve in his or her body, thus he or she falls prey to the disease,\u201d Shah said. The sudden fall in glucose level has been attributed in many researches to consumption of unripe litchis by children, followed by lack of a proper meal at night. \u201cThe unripe litchi contains a high concentration of the toxin called methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), which triggers hypoglycemia if consumed by a child with a malnourished body,\u201d Shah added. As per National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4, 2015-16), only 34% of children in Bihar receive supplementary food at anganwadi centres. This has been corroborated by residents of the affected villages in Muzaffarpur, which has been the epicentre of AES outbreaks almost every year since 1995. They claim that villagers hardly get any benefits of the ICDS programme or the anganwadi centres. Krishna Prasad, resident of Mustafapur village in Kanti block in Muzaffarpur, whose 10-year child died on June 10, said: \u201cThe Anganbadi centre in our village is not open for more than 10 days in a month,\u201d he said. Prasad also alleged that the anganwadi sevika runs the centre from her home. The NFHS-4 report says that only around 49% of children under the age of six in Bihar receive services of any kind from anganwadi centres. It also says that 48% of children under the age of five are stunted or too short for their age, which indicated that they were undernourished for some time. Also, 48% of the kids in the same age group were underweight, which takes into account both chronic and acute undernutrition.  \u201cWorld Health Organization has stated that 45% of the deaths among kids aged up to five years across the globe is due to malnutrition. Thus, there is urgent need of spreading awareness and taking steps for eradicating malnutrition to prevent fatal diseases like AES,\u201d UNICEF-Bihar\u2019s Parhi said.
