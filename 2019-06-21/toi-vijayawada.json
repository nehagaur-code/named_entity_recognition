Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

The Andhra Pradesh tourism department, which was expected to complete the works by January 30, has not yet been able to complete the process of announcing and accepting tenders. Once a prime tourist destination in the city, Gandhi Hill has been struggling under monumental neglect for almost two decades now. Nothing but a few dilapidated structures stand atop the hill now. Members of Gandhi Hill foundation had been requesting the Andhra Pradesh tourism development corporation (APTDC) to save the tourist spot. Since Gandhi Hill is located next to Vijayawada railway station, APTDC noticed its potential and Rs 5 crore was sanctioned to facelift the planetarium and the library at Gandhi Hill. Also, for the first time in the country, a glow garden was going to come up on the hill.

Speaking to TOI, Abdul Azeez, a city-based activist pointed out, \u201cfor two years now, the planetarium that once attracted school children and tourists has been closed due to equipment failures.

While assuming charge as minister in the secretariat on Thursday, Suresh promised that the government would completely revamp the public education system in a few years. Earlier, there were talks that the Amma Vodi scheme would be extended to both government and private schools. Suresh said that the government would take a call on extending the scheme to private schools after studying the situation. In the first phase, therefore, only government schools will get the benefit. The minister warned that they would not hesitate to take action against the private schools if they try to lure students in the name of Amma Vodi. He went on to say that the scheme was introduced to reduce the dropout rate and help poor parents send their wards to schools. Suresh, however, said that they are open to extending the scheme to private schools but only after consultations with experts. \u201cWe are committed to strengthen the government schools first. We will introduce English medium branches alongside Telugu medium in all the schools to improve our enrolments,\u201d assured the minister. He added that they have also taken a decision to abolish the 20 per cent internal assessment marks being awarded for the SSC students. He said that the government has noticed that only private schools were getting benefitted from the internal assessment marks and hence has decided to do away with the system. The government would definitely regulate the fees in corporate schools and colleges, Suresh promised. According to him, a committee has been appointed to make suitable recommendations so that fees can be regulates atprivate educational institutions. Suresh pointed out further that he had cleared the long-pending issue of granting promotions to school teachers and that about 19,000 teachers would get benefit of promotions.

Kapus are numerically strong in East and West Godavari districts and whichever party won the majority of seats in the Godavari belt has always formed the state government. The YSRCP bagged most of the seats in Godavari districts in the recent assembly polls and the Kapu leaders in the TDP took stock of the political situation post elections. Even as the meeting was being held, four of the TDP MPs in the Rajya Sabha had joined the BJP in New Delhi. The Kapu leaders will meet again to decide on the future course of action, sources said. According to sources, the TDP Kapu leaders met under the leadership of former MLA Thota Thrimurthulu in a hotel in Kakinada. Though the meeting was kept secret, visuals of the deliberations went viral on social media. Kapu leaders from Krishna district too attended the meeting that lasted for about four hours.  Though the leaders later told media that the meeting was convened to analyse the reasons for the defeat of the TDP in the assembly and the Lok Sabha elections, sources said they discussed about the need to join the BJP. Some leaders expressed the view that joining the ruling YSRCP would be a better option. Sources said the TDP leaders have been in constant touch with the BJP top leadership in Delhi. Senior BJP leader Ram Madhav incidentally hails East Godavari district. Thursday's meeting is said to be in continuation of the individual confabulations the Kapu leaders had with the BJP's central leadership.

One of the techniques, which seems to be gaining in popularity in the city is the use of Pressure Compensating Aerator (PCA). While people residing in areas like Kirlampudi layout, Siripuram, have already adopted the technology, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation has also adopted the same. Apart from a few private companies, hospitals and hotels in the city, the Navy house and naval quarters have also come forward to use the technology. Speaking to TOI, GVMC commissioner, M Hari Narayanan, said, \u201cWe have adopted this technology in the GVMC building and it is a good initiative towards sustainable use of water. Small drops make an ocean; hence this initiative will go a long way in the future.\u201d Similarly, Uday Shirname, president of Kirlampudi Layout RWA and AP Federation of RWAs, said, \u201cWe have installed the water nozzles with this technology in all the main water points in every flat of our building and the result is surprising. 40%-50% of the water can be saved without compromising on the comfort level. Other buildings in my colony have also followed the same. The nozzles are cheap and easy to install.\u201d Speaking about the technology\u2019s effectiveness, the business head of a private company, which sells the product said \u201cUnlike countries like Singapore, there is no regulatory mechanism to control pressure of water in the country. Hence, a lot of water goes waste. \u201cThe water discharge in Litres Per Minute (LPM) while washing hands is around 9-12 LPM. But the PCA technology helps in saving 80% water as it comes down to 2 LPM. Similarly, the LPM for showerheads is 20-25 LPM but if the technology is adopted, the LPM reduces it to nine.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Vijayawada is worse off than Visakhapatnam which achieved a score of 68.01 and was ranked 106th globally. Other two-tier cities which have ranked better than Vijayawada include Pune, Ahmedabad, Dehradun, Madurai, Thane, Nagpur, Vadodara, Coimbatore and Indore.

The NIA has challenged the decision of the special NIA court, which granted bail to Srinivasa Rao recently. The NIA argued that the special court, while granting bail to Srinivasa Rao, did not give any reasons. The Suppression of Unlawful Acts against Safety of Civil Aviation Act mandates to give reasons while granting bail to the accused, according to section 6A of the Act. However, the NIA court did not consider this while granting bail to the accused, the NIA stated in its plea, while adding that though a charge sheet has been filed, their investigation is yet to be completed. Giving bail to the accused while the investigation is underway could hamper its progress, argued Sidda Ramulu, the NIA counsel. Countering the argument, Matta Jayakar, the counsel for Srinivas Rao, said the accused is not a terrorist or extremist. He further argued that no one knows exactly what happened on that day as no CCTV footage is available. Also, the NIA has stated in the lower court that they are filing a final charge sheet. As it has also been filed, there is no reason to reject bail to the accused, he argued. However, the high court bench headed by chief justice C Praveen Kumar asked Jayakar\u2019s stand on section 6A, to which he sought one week\u2019s time.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Kapus are numerically strong in East and West Godavari districts and whichever party has won the majority of seats in the Godavari belt has always formed the state government. YSRCP bagged most of the seats in the Godavari districts in the recent assembly polls and the Kapu leadership in TDP took stock of the political situation post-elections. Even as the meeting was being held, four of the TDP MPs in the Rajya Sabha had joined BJP in New Delhi. The Kapu leaders will meet again to decide on the future course of action, sources said. According to sources, Kapu leaders met under the chairmanship of former MLA Thota Trimurthulu in a hotel in Kakinada town. Though the meeting was kept a secret, visuals of the deliberations circulated in social media groups. Kapu leaders from Krishna district too attended the meeting that lasted for about four hours. Prominent Kapu leaders present were Bonda Uma, Badeti Bujji, B Vedavyas, Chengalrayudu, Jyothula Nehru, Madhava Naidu, Eli Nani, Meesala Geetha, Varupula Raju, KA Naidu and Panchakarla Ramesh Babu. Though the leaders later told media that the meeting was convened to analyse reasons for the defeat of TDP in the assembly and the Lok Sabha elections, sources said they discussed the need to join BJP. Some expressed the view that the YSRCP would be a better option. The meeting gained significance as TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu is away on a family vacation in Europe. Sources said TDP leaders have been in constant touch with the BJP top leadership in New Delhi. Senior BJP leader Ram Madhav is, incidentally, from East Godavari district. Thursday\u2019s meeting is said to be in continuation of the individual confabulations the Kapu leaders had with the BJP central leadership. Ram Madhav is reportedly in touch with some of the TDP Kapu leaders as part of the grand plans to expand BJP\u2019s base in AP. BJP hopes that it can emerge as a strong political alternative to YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh. As the news of the secret meeting spread, Naidu spoke with some of the party leaders and advised them against taking any hasty decision. Thota Trimurthulu later told media that the meeting was held to discuss the problems of the Kapu community, besides exploring the reasons for TDP\u2019s debacle in the assembly polls. He said the meeting was held in a hotel and not in the TDP district office as all the invitees hailed from one community. He said the leaders did not discuss leaving TDP.

On Wednesday, YSRCP workers in a village in Guntur constructed a wall across a road to prevent TDP workers from using it. In another incident, YSRCP workers in Prakasam district dug up a cement road laid by the previous TDP government about 10 months ago alleging that the people using the road had not voted for YSRCP in the assembly polls. The police had to intervene in both villages to maintain law and order. A picket was posted at Ponugupadu village of Phirangipuram mandal in Guntur district where a three-feet wall was raised blocking the village thoroughfare. Since incident has a caste angle, the police held a peace meeting between the rival TDP and YSRCP groups. A majority of TDP supporters are from an upper caste, while YSRC supporters belong to Scheduled Castes. YSRC supporters have claimed the wall was built to prevent encroachment by TDP men as the land used for the road was on private property, but TDP supporters maintained the road belonged to revenue department and was been used for the last 80 years. Phirangipuram SI D Srihari said the claims have been referred to the revenue department and in the meantime the area has been kept out of bounds for public. Political workers dig up cement roadEarlier, there have been incidents of demolition of flag posts and party arches and attacks on political opponents in Narasaraopet, Sattenapalli, Macherla and Gurazala assembly constituencies in Guntur. These constituencies fall under Palnadu region, once known for its faction feuds. In the other incident at Uppalapadu village in Kanigiri assembly constituency in Prakasam district, a cement road was dug up with an excavator. The road was laid at Muslim Colony around 10 months ago. The road was dug up as the residents allegedly supported the TDP candidate in the just-concluded assembly elections. A complaint has been lodged with the police. Meanwhile, the situation at Manchikallu, Pinnelli, Machavaram Mutyalampadu and Tangeda villages turned serious as local TDP leaders fled fearing attacks. About 70 families in Pinnelli supported the TDP in the recent elections. They are taking shelter at Gamalapadu near Dachepalli. They met Guntur rural SP seeking protection. As many as 15 cases have been registered in Narasaraopet, Sattenapalli and Gurazala police sub-divisions since election results. A little over 40 people were injured in clashes after the polls.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

He said the building where Naidu has been staying is illegal as it was constructed on a riverbed. Only a few days ago, Naidu wrote to the state government seeking permission to use Praja Vedika, an extension to his residential building, for official purpose to meet party workers. Naidu, as leader of the opposition, enjoys the status of a Cabinet minister. He had sought utilisation of the building complex as part of his official entitlement. While the state government is yet to respond to Naidu\u2019s request, Ramakrishna Reddy, who defeated Naidu\u2019s son and political heir Nara Lokesh in recent assembly elections, told media that Naidu would be evicted from his residence. The government will use all legal process to evict him as the building is an illegal construction in violation of environment norms. The building is owned by an industrialist and the previous state government had hired it for Naidu as official residence. Ramakrishna Reddy had earlier moved high court over the constructions made on the right bank of Krishna River in Guntur district. Reddy alleged that all houses constructed on the river bank including that of Chandrababu Naidu are illegal. He argued in his petition that all these constructions are made in violation of River Conservation Act. Ramakrishna Reddy on Tuesday said the house where Naidu is residing is \u201cdefinitely an illegal construction and our legal fight against all illegal constructions will continue till they are vacated and demolished. We will make Naidu to vacate the illegal construction through legal process,\u201d he said. He also criticised Naidu for staying in illegal construction. Naidu made tall claims over construction of capital Amaravati but he did not even have his own house in Amaravati whereas chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy build his house at Tadepalli, he said. Naidu has been staying in the riverside bungalow for the last four years after the state administration moved to Vijayawada from Hyderabad. The house belonged to a private person but the previous government took it on lease basis for the official residence of chief minister. Later the government constructed \u2018Praja Vedika\u2019, a meeting hall to conduct meetings. TDP MLA Payyavula Keshav said YSRC is resorting to vindictive politics.

While directing the officers to take strict action, school education commissioner Sandhya Rani said on Wednesday: \u201cThe Government is yet to finalise the guidelines for implementation of Amma Vodi. Trying to take advantage of the scheme without proper guidelines is violation of rules.\u201d On the other hand, enrolments in government schools have witnessed a steep jump since the chief minister\u2019s announcement of the Amma Vodi scheme. Government schools reported to have enrolled nearly 85,000 students in a week. The scheme, which offers cash incentive to mothers for sending their wards to schools, has attracted a lot of clamour already and the two main sparring parties have been private and government schools. While government school teachers demand that the Amma Vodi benefits should be confined exclusively to the public education system, many private schools have already started publicising on the lines of Amma Vodi. What\u2019s odd is that the education department hasn\u2019t yet been able to decide upon the guidelines for implementation of the scheme. Sources say that the government might extend the benefit to all schools public and private since chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy thinks that infrastructure in the public schools is not developed enough to absorb the additional flow. The government might, in fact, limit the scheme after two years when infrastructure is developed and public schools are ready to take in a bigger population of students. It is estimated that about 55 per cent of students (till high school) go to government schools while 45 per cent go to private schools. \u201cThe buildings are not suited to accommodate more students and the teacher strength is poor. We might require at least 20,000 additional teachers to make Amma Vodi work,\u201d said a government school teacher. However, experts are of the view that the government should extend the coverage of Amma Vodi to only those private schools which have infrastructure as per the recognition rules.

This is the third time that the TDP is in a deep political crisis since its formation in 1982, and on two occasions the party president was on foreign tour at the time of the crisis. On one occasion, the TDP supremo was away from the state capital. August is generally regarded as a \u2018month of bad omen\u2019 in TDP circles, as party founder NT Rama Rao had lost chief ministership twice in August. This time, the crisis has knocked at TDP\u2019s doors two months earlier. The party had, however, survived the earlier two crisis though Rama Rao could not retain power on one occasion. The TDP was in power on two occasions. This time it is in the opposition after last month\u2019s unprecedented electoral defeat. The TDP plunged into a political crisis for the first time in August 1984. Rama Rao, who was the chief minister then, went to the USA for heart surgery. In his absence, a political coup was meticulously planned and executed by his cabinet colleague Nadendla Bhaskar Rao. Rama Rao had the strength in the state assembly but he had to take to the streets to force the governor to conduct a floor test. Bhaskar Rao resigned a month later and Rama Rao was reinstated as chief minister. In the second political crisis in August 1995, Rama Rao was away in Srikakulam district launching \u2018government-at-people\u2019s-doorsteps\u2019 programme, when his son-in-law and then revenue minister N Chandrababu Naidu executed a political coup, dethroning him from the chief ministership. Naidu then took over the reins of undivided AP. Rama Rao, who was forced to form NTR-TDP, died in January 1996 before the general elections held in May.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

According to Penamaluru inspector V Peddiraju, the 50-year-old accused Nafeesa (name changed) was in an alleged extra-marital affair with her brother-in-law Khaleel for the past five years. Over the years, Nafeesa grew jealous of Khaleel\u2019s wife and decided to kill her in her sleep. The incident happened at around 9am in the morning after Nafeesa\u2019s husband Karim who is a daily wage labourer at Auto Nagar left for work. Nafeesa then walked into Khaleel\u2019s room and found him sleeping next to another woman whom she assumed to be his wife. However, it was Hajnissa (Khaleel\u2019s sister) who was actually sleeping next to him under the blanket.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

US mulling 15% cap on H-1B visa for Indians\"The Trump Administration has no plans to place caps on H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally,\" a state department spokeswoman said in a statement in response to the Reuters article. While an administration's \"Buy American Hire American\" executive order calls for a broad review of US worker visa programs, including the H-1B programme, it was not targeted at a specific country, the spokeswoman said. It is \"completely separate from our ongoing discussions with India about the importance of ensuring the free flow of data across borders,\" the spokeswoman added. Earlier on Thursday, India said it was in talks with the United States on H-1B visas, but foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar told a news conference: \"We have not heard anything officially from the US government\" on capping such permits for Indians. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo is scheduled to visit New Delhi next week for talks that will include areas of disagreement between the two countries over trade. H-1B cap for India? It\u2019s not easy and may need approval by US Congress, say expertsTwo senior Indian officials told Reuters on Wednesday they had been briefed last week on a US plan to cap the number of H-1B visas given annually to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the total number issued. There is no country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas the United States issues every year, and an estimated 70% of them go to Indians.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

From stupas to forts, AP\u2019s culture showcases are diverse and give ample tourism opportunities. APTA is taking steps to promote adventure bike rides in possible tourism locations like Araku Valley, Maredumilli, Konaseema, Gandikota and Horsley Hills. These locations have great possibilities to promote motorbike tours and the best possible months for bike tourism is from September to March.

The best route in AP for a bike tour would be from Maredumilli till Araku, if one wants to experience both scenic beauty as well as adventure,\u201d Rao said.

On Wednesday, YSRCP workers in a village in Guntur constructed a wall across a road to prevent TDP workers from using it. In another incident, YSRCP workers in Prakasam district dug up a cement road laid by the previous TDP government about 10 months ago alleging that the people using the road had not voted for YSRCP in the assembly polls. The police had to intervene in both villages to maintain law and order. A picket was posted at Ponugupadu village of Phirangipuram mandal in Guntur district where a three-feet wall was raised blocking the village thoroughfare. Since incident has a caste angle, the police held a peace meeting between the rival TDP and YSRCP groups. A majority of TDP supporters are from an upper caste, while YSRC supporters belong to Scheduled Castes. YSRC supporters have claimed the wall was built to prevent encroachment by TDP men as the land used for the road was on private property, but TDP supporters maintained the road belonged to revenue department and was been used for the last 80 years. Phirangipuram SI D Srihari said the claims have been referred to the revenue department and in the meantime the area has been kept out of bounds for public. Earlier, there have been incidents of demolition of flag posts and party arches and attacks on political opponents in Narasaraopet, Sattenapalli, Macherla and Gurazala assembly constituencies in Guntur district. These constituencies fall under Palnadu region, once known for its faction feuds. In the other incident at Uppalapadu village in Kanigiri assembly constituency in Prakasam district, a cement road was dug up with an excavator. The road was laid at Muslim Colony around 10 months ago. The road was dug up as the residents allegedly supported the TDP candidate in the just-concluded assembly elections. A complaint has been lodged with the police. Meanwhile, the situation at Manchikallu, Pinnelli, Machavaram Mutyalampadu and Tangeda villages turned serious as local TDP leaders fled fearing attacks. About 70 families in Pinnelli supported the TDP in the recent elections. They are now taking shelter at Gamalapadu near Dachepalli. They met Guntur rural SP seeking protection. As many as 15 cases have been registered in Narasaraopet, Sattenapalli and Gurazala police sub-divisions since the election results. A little over 40 people were injured in the clashes that broke out after the polls. Guntur rural SP R Jayalakshmi told TOI that the situation by and large was peaceful in Palnadu region. There have been some incidents of clashes in some areas, but all issues have been addressed, she said, adding that cases have been booked against the attackers. \u201cPolice teams are holding counselling sessions for village elders, apart from rounding up history-sheeters,\u201d she said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022. And once we come, we will stay here for long on the basis of our hard work,\" she said adding that the hard-workers would be adequately rewarded.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?
