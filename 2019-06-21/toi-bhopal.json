Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Measures should be taken to prevent sewage flow into the lakes,\u201d he added. The drive -- if taken to its conclusion -- means some harsh action needs to be taken by the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the district administration. Much of the catchment area of the millennia old lake has been encroached upon. The move -- beyond symbolism -- to revitalise the Upper Lake would take coordination between 12 government departments. For now, most the government departments are pitching in with their heavy machinery to dig the Upper Lake and use the soil in gardens and other locations. \u201cThe demolition drive should begin from Khanugoan,\u201d said Alok Sharma. \u201cIf the Congress government was to initiate the drive to remove encroachments, we would support the move. Anti-encroachment drive can begin from anywhere,\u201d said BJP MLA from Kolar, Rameshwar Sharma. A huge number of volunteers were at the Upper Lake along Bairagarh to take part in the drive. One hundred and sixty truck loads of sand was removed near Bishankhedi.

In the garb of city beautification, the height of central verges and pedestrian walkways are being increased. According to experts, government agencies need to make roads safe and easy for pedestrians. As per Rule 11 of the Rules of the Road Regulations, 1989, pedestrians have the right of way at uncontrolled pedestrian crossings. A case in point is the increase in height of the central verge near Bittan Market. A BMC official, Vinod Shukla, explained that crossing a verge is not legal as per law. \"There are demarcated zebra crossings for proper crossing of road,\" he said.

They found that in tribal districts, less than 30% students could understand, read and speak Hindi as opposed to 70% who only communicated in their local dialect. \u201cChildren of the tribal areas do not understand Hindi as their mother tongue is different. They only know the local dialects and face difficulty when they are taught in Hindi in schools. Many of them also drop out of school from class 1 and class 2 as they are unable to make sense of what is being taught. Teachers are unable to explain the meaning in their local dialect, making things more difficult. So after developing the curriculum, we also trained the teachers,\u201d said Sandeep Tirkey, program head of NEG. Irene Cynthia J P, director of Rajya Shiksha Kendra, told TOI that the initiative had been taken to make children of tribal districts attend school and understand what is being taught, instead of dropping out. Assessment of the initiative will be done in year 2020 to gauge the impact of the programme and the changes needed. The RSK is all set to start the programme in four other districts -- Harda, Betul, Anoop-pur and Shadol -- from the new academic session. \u201cIf the new initiative makes a difference, we will expand it to more areas in the coming year. This will help children learn the state language as well as the mother tongue so that they can continue their studies further,\u201d she said.

Based on media reports that Mishra\u2019s father Kulmani Mishra had died and yet his son was keeping his \u201clifeless\u201d body in his house, SHRC directed the director general of police (DGP) on February 14, 2019, to find out whether death of Kulmani Mishra was natural or unnatural, whether the body was cremated and if not, what scientific steps were taken by Rajendra Mishra to preserve the body and report back to the commission within three days. The DGP replied on February 18 that the doctors of Bansal Hospital, where Mishra\u2019s father was being treated, declared him dead but Mishra didn\u2019t allow the police to enter his house. Then, the SHRC on February 19, 2019 directed for constitution of two teams of medical expert from allopathy and ayurvedic medicine, which shall visit Mishra\u2019s house with a police officer of the rank not less than superintendent of police (SP) to find out whether Mishra\u2019s father was alive. It was against these directives that Mishra and her mother had moved the high court, describing the same as violative of their right to privacy.The court of Justice Atul Sreedharan, while taking note that there has been no complaint of foul smell emanating from Mishra\u2019s residence and a practitioner in ayurvedic medicine has presented a certificate that he was treating Mishra\u2019s father, said, \u201cEven if SHRC believed that Mishra\u2019s father was no more, it had no business to intrude into his private life using agencies of the state.\u201d \u201cThus, the act of the petitioner No. 2 (Rajendra Mishra), even assuming arguendo that his father is no more and he has kept the human remains in his residential premises, by itself does not become an illegality, warranting intrusive action by the State. A regime, which forbids everything save only those things that are expressly allowed, would be regarded as a bullying power-structure, while a regime which permits everything save only those things that are expressly forbidden, would be counted liberal by contrast. India falls in the latter category being a liberal democracy where a man is permitted to act in any manner he pleases, where such act is not prohibited under the law, irrespective of the fact that his act might be seen as galling by the majority\u201d, said Justice Sreedharan.He further said \u201cThus, the petition succeeds, the impugned direction given by the respondent no. 2 (State Human Rights Commission) to the State is held to be violative of the right to privacy of the Petitioners and thereby violative of the fundamental right to life of the Petitioner as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution. Therefore, the same is quashed\u201d.Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Arjun Kapoor": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/arjun-kapoors-funny-reaction-on-malaika-aroras-new-post/videoshow/69877017.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "BJP holds video conference for membership drive": {"datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bjp-holds-video-conference-for-membership-drive/articleshow/69865209.cms", "time": "2019-06-20 04:58:00", "description": "Bhopal: With an aim to increase party membership by 20 percent, the state BJP held a video conferencing of all the membership campaign conveners under the leadership of national convener Shivraj Singh Chouhan.

The children had been taken away by their maternal grandparents to Bihar after the alleged murder of their mother by the father. The court suggested that father being the only natural guardian of the child in the absence of mother was entitled to take a decision as to where his son should stay. Paternal grandparents, Bhramarkant Jha and his wife, residents of Anuppur district in MP, had filed a habeas corpus petition after their grand son and grand daughter, aged eight and six years respectively, were taken away by his maternal grandparents to Sihersa in Bihar after their father allegedly shot dead his wife and wife of his brother at his house in Anuppur. Now, he is in jail under judicial custody. In their habeas corpus petition, Bharamkant and his wife said that their son, Nirmal Jha, is accused of murder of his wife Pooja and wife of his brother, Archana on August 5, 2018. After his arrest, Pooja\u2019s parents, Indra Kumar Jha and Sudha Jha, came down from Bihar and took the children with them. They said that their son wished that the children stayed with their paternal grandparents and prayed the court to handover custody of the children to them. The court in response to their petition had directed Anuppur police to produce the children and their maternal grandparents in the court. After they were produced in the court on Tuesday, Justice Atul Sreedharan in his brief order said \u201cpursuant to the orders passed on April 30, 2019, the children have been produced before this court by Indra Kumar Jha and Sunila Jha, who are the maternal grandparents of the children. They have been requested to handover the children to Bhramarkant Jha, who is the paternal grandfather of the children. It is relevant to state here that the father of these children, who is presently in judicial custody, had desired that his children be with his parents on the basis of which Bhramarkant Jha filed this writ petition for habeas corpus. The children had been taken away to Sahersa in Bihar by Indra Kumar Jha and Sunila Jha. But, as stated herein above, they have produced the corpus before this court. They are also handing over the custody of the corpus to the petitioners today in the presence of the court. ASI Pramod Verma, Bhalumada, district Anuppur, is present before this court.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

But this prompted the district authorities across the state to increase the collector guidelines to generate more revenue from the market. Unfortunately, this proved to be detrimental, resulting in a major slump in the sector, said real estate experts.

He said in urban areas, buyers will have to shell out 3% extra fee like before.

The stamp duty and registration fee on donation of the property have also been reduced to one per cent with maximum amount of Rs 500 and Rs 100 respectively against the current rate of 2.5% and 0.8%, he said.

He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Clean-up of the catchment area is vital to water flowing into the Upper Lake. The programme was scheduled to begin from Tuesday but has been postponed for a day, according to BMC sources. Meanwhile, the BMC has a new plan to provide water to areas only connected with Upper Lake water supply. The plan was discussed with senior urban development officials. Sources said that alternate day water supply, additional water tankers and other contingencies are being worked out. It is estimated that water supply from Idgah Hills filtration plant could stop pumping water from July 1, if the Upper Lake water level does not increase by then. Around five lakh people get water from the Upper Lake. For the moment, BMC has ruled out restriction on use of water on construction and other sites.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life.

The children had been taken away by their maternal grandparents to Bihar after the alleged murder of their mother by the father. The court suggested that father being the only natural guardian of the child in the absence of mother was entitled to take a decision as to where his son should stay. Paternal grandparents, Bhramarkant Jha and his wife, residents of Anuppur district in MP, had filed a habeas corpus petition after their grand son and grand daughter, aged eight and six years respectively, were taken away by his maternal grandparents to Saharsa in Bihar after their father allegedly shot dead his wife and wife of his brother at his house in Anuppur. Now, he is in jail under judicial custody. In their habeas corpus petition, Bharamkant and his wife said that their son, Nirmal Jha, is accused of murder of his wife Pooja and wife of his brother, Archana on August 5, 2018. After his arrest, Pooja\u2019s parents, Indra Kumar Jha and Sudha Jha, came down from Bihar and took the children with them. They said that their son wished that the children stayed with their paternal grandparents and prayed the court to handover custody of the children to them. After they were produced in the court on Tuesday, Justice Atul Sreedharan in his brief order said \u201cpursuant to the orders passed on April 30, 2019, the children have been produced before this court by Indra Kumar Jha and Sunila Jha, who are the maternal grandparents of the children. They have been requested to handover the children to Bhramarkant Jha, who is the paternal grandfather of the children. It is relevant to state here that the father of these children, who is presently in judicial custody, had desired that his children be with his parents on the basis of which Bhramarkant Jha filed this writ petition for habeas corpus. The children had been taken away to Sahersa in Bihar by Indra Kumar Jha and Sunila Jha. But, as stated herein above, they have produced the corpus before this court.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The chief minister will visit Jhabua to participate in a state government-sponsored mass marriage programme and to inaugurate \u201cSchool Chale Hum\u201d campaign in the state in the new academic session, but both Bhuria and Medha are likely to use the opportunity to show their strength to chief minister on the ground. Bhuria and Medha are both vying for Congress ticket from Jhabua seat in the by-election necessitated after Guman Singh Damor quit as MLA from Jhabua seat after being elected to Lok Sabha from Jhabua-Ratlam against Congress heavyweight Kantilal Bhuria. He was the only MLA given ticket by the BJP in Lok Sabha election and his win against Bhuria necessitated the by-election in Jhabua assembly election. Jhabua by-election is crucial for the Congress not only to overcome the highly demoralizing impact of rout in the recent Lok Sabha election but also to increase its numbers by one in a delicately-balanced state assembly. As of now, Congress has 114 MLAs in the House as against 108 of the BJP (after Damor\u2019s resignation) and win at Jhabua would jack up its number to 115, only one short of absolute majority in the House. With an independent Prakash Jaiswal already a part of Kamal Nath cabinet, Congress would be far more confident of its majority in the House. Going by the results of past three assembly elections, Congress is aware that it could win the seat but only if Bhuria and Medha camps came together or at least don\u2019t indulge in sabotage, if ticket is given to one obviously at the cost of the other. Both Bhuria and Xavier Medha have staked their claim for ticket from Jhabua and now it is for the party leadership to persuade one of them to withdraw from the fray because if both continue to demand ticket and indulge in sabotage or rebellion when any of the two is denied ticket, chances of the Congress winning its traditional seat will diminish as was the case in 2008 and 2013 election. In 2008, Bhuria\u2019s niece Kalawati Bhuria had rebelled after Medha, the incumbent MLA, was again nominated as party candidate, contested as independent candidate and ensured Medha\u2019s defeat. In the subsequent election in 2013, Medha paid back when he contested against official party candidate and son of Kantilal Bhuria, Vikrant Bhuria, and polled over 35000 votes to ensure Bhuria\u2019s defeat. \u201cBhuria\u2019s niece had made such a big impact in 2013 and Medha even bigger in 2018 as rebel candidate. We are sure Bhuria won\u2019t quit the party or contest as rebel candidate but even if he stays inert, he would inflict enough damage to the party and as far as Medha is concerned, he has rebelled once and could do it again. He may even be lured by BJP, if the party doesn\u2019t get a proper candidate\u201d, said a senior Congress leader from the region. He also pointed out that in contrast to 2013 and 2018 election, Medha had won the 2008 election by almost 20,000 votes because there was no rebel candidate from either of the camps.

Megha was in Bhopal to attend a function at Bhojpur Club which gave her a lifetime membership of the club. Notably, this year 11 climbers have lost their lives due to heavy traffic during the summit. Talking to TOI, Megha said that it is unfortunate that this year so many people have lost their lives in their attempt to reach the summit. \u201cLike me it is dream of every climber to complete the summit. However, it is disheartening to see that people are losing lives as traffic has increased significantly,\u201d said Megha. Asked for the reason of such a rush, Megha said, \u201cIt is because there is no restriction. Anyone who can pay the fee with even less mountaineering experience can attempt climbing. On the other hand, China not only restricts number of applications but allows only experienced climbers to attempt the summit.\u201d She said that more people are dying because of the lack of proper training. \u201cEven if you have done the certificate course a good climber does lot of training under professional trainers. They put themselves under tough training situation so that they can fight exigencies,\u201d said Megha. She said that despite so many climbers attempting the Mt Everest summit every year the awareness is poor about it. \u201cPeople ask me the height which I touched at the Mt Everest. It is unfortunate that people do not know even the height of the Mt Everest which are available in several school books,\u201d said Megha. She is willing to coach and teach if she gets an offer. \u201cI have achieved what I wanted to. I have touched the highest peak and now my next target is to touch the lowest point of the world. However, if anyone offers me to train I will do it to motivate others,\u201d said Megha. Incidentally, for three days after completing the summit, Sehore's Megha drifted in and out of consciousness, unable to tell anyone back home that she had achieved her dream. Later, she disclosed her journey of completing the summit. Daughter of a farmer in a landlocked state like MP, Megha always dreamt of standing on the top of the world. After a failed attempt last year, at 5am on May 22 this year she stood on the peak of Mt Everest. Megah had to turn back just 700 metres from the summit last year. Undaunted, she decided to try again. But there was another shock in store. \"I had fractured my backbone in three places in a training accident in July last year. But I had promised myself that I will summit within a year, and began training again in November,\" she said. Her determination paid off, and she was elated to reach the summit.

UAHD principal secretary Sanjay Dubey, in a circular sent to all local bodies and district collectors, has instructed them to take immediate measures to curb dog menace. UAHD now aims to reduce the canine population, promote sterilization and immunization of all dogs within a span of two years. UAHD directive began with a cautionary note, in case some urban bodies go overboard with the move. UAHD has cited Preventions of Cruelty Against Animals Act, 1960 and Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001 and MP Human Rights Commission\u2019s (MPHRC) directives over the issue and the reduction of man-dog conflict. MPHRC has taken note of media reports over deaths due to dog bites in Bhopal. UAHD wants to begin with a dog count in each city. Urban development notice stated that current plan to curb dog menace isn\u2019t sufficient and ineffective and hence it wants all urban bodies to complete sterilization and immunization of dogs within two years after conducting a demographic survey. UAHD wants more dog pounds, kennel shelters within city limits to cater to dogs, which are ill or in need of proper care. In Bhopal, the district administration has already allocated land in four locations. The order focuses on having dog squads matching the population of dogs in a city. The teams should be available and able to reach on the dog bite site within a stipulated time limit. Dog population would also determine the number of vehicles each municipal body would have for the task. The establishment of Animal Birth Control Monitoring Committees at local authority levels in accordance with Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules is indispensable for the success of the program. The constitution of the monitoring committee is provided in Rule 4, and the functions that it is required to perform are provided in Rule 5. Besides, pre-surgical checks, dogs assessed to be incurably ill or mortally wounded shall be dealt with in the manner prescribed in Rule 9 of the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules. Street dogs suspected to be rabid have to be dealt with strictly in the manner prescribed in Rule 10 of the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001. To confirm rabies, the brain sample of every street dog suspected to have died of rabies must be sent to the closest accredited laboratory and a report must be obtained for every death under this category. 24X7 availability and dispensation of rabies injection has also been mandated.

Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.
