Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

But the famed Surat diamond industry is not. A doctoral study by a college faculty has revealed that women employees in the Rs 80,000 crore diamond industry are paid half compared to their male counterparts. The discrimination in wages is because the women don\u2019t polish diamonds. However, they are tasked with equally responsible work like weighing polished gems, and maintaining the stock etc. The study revealed that the average monthly salary of women is around Rs 11,883 while male employees earn an average Rs 23,340. According to official figures, the total workforce in the diamond industry is around five lakh. Of these. 1.5 lakh are registered with Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) of which around 4% are women. When asked about the discrimination in wages, Dinesh Navadiya, regional chairman, Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), said, \u201cThe difference in salaries is because women are not into polishing, which requires special skills. The polishers get paid for work done. Women prefer to work in office jobs.\u201d \u201cMajority of the women are in non-polishing jobs, but they do equally important work like weighing, maintaining stock and keeping records. However, their salaries are less and they don\u2019t have any complaint for being paid lesser salary compared to men,\u201d said Ashmita Khatrani, who did the study under the guidance of Dilip Varsani, principal of J B Dharukawala Women Arts College.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh.

Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

India being KPCS chair, hosting the first intercessional meeting in Mumbai, which kick-started from Monday, activists of international civil society have raised the issue of conflict diamonds involving some African countries. The meeting will conclude on June 21. Civil Society Coalition (CSC), an alliance of international civil society organizations affiliated to KPCS and other bodies, are demanding that Zimbabwe\u2019s gemstones be classified as conflict diamonds. Civil groups have highlighted dangerous implications for international stability because of involvement of military officials in diamond mining or trading in Zimbabwe, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Venezuela. Diamantaires in Surat have set their eyes on Zimbabwe for importing rough diamonds. Recently, government of Zimbabwe commissioned diamond exploration in 8,800 square kilometre area, which could possibly have a large diamond deposit. The diamonds mined in Zimbabwe are used by diamantaires, especially small and medium diamond units, for manufacturing near gem quality diamonds set in wrist watches and bling jewellery. With prices of rough diamonds from mines across the world skyrocketing in the last one year, diamantaires hope entry of Zimbabwe diamonds would provide a major boost to the ailing diamond sector. Industry sources said Zimbabwe government has set a target of producing more than 12 million carats of diamonds per annum. Filip Reyniers, director of International Peace Information Service (IPIS), recently demanded \u201cThat the United Nations (UN) expand the definition of conflict diamonds to incorporate those mined with the involvement of the army in any given country - drawing from the experience of Central African Republic.\u201d Reyniers said some lessons can be learnt from the conflict diamond issues affecting Central African Republic (CAR). These include the need to expand the definition of what constitutes a conflict diamond - a restriction that impeded KP intervention in the CAR to prevent a brutal part-diamond funded rebel coup in 2013. Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion regional chairman Dinesh Navadia told TOI, \u201cDiamonds mined in Zimbabwe are cheaper than those from other parts of Africa and this is where diamantaires could gain maximum profit and procure diamonds at competitive rates.

Police booked Mevani at Valsad town police station on Thursday for naming a school of Valsad in the video he shared on his Twitter handle on May 20, which shows a student being thrashed by a schoolteacher with a stick. Police suspect Mevani had shared the video along with the text, which was already viral on social media, without caring to check the facts with the people concerned. Mevani has been booked for defamation under Indian Penal Code sections that deal with publishing and circulating of defamatory statement, rumour or report about someone. Police have informed the speaker of state assembly about registration of the offence against Mevani on a complaint lodged by Bijal Patel, principal of RM and VM Desai Sarvajanik Vidyalaya of Valsad. Patel has alleged in her complaint that Mevani shared the video without verifying the facts with them, thus causing damage to the school\u2019s reputation and adversely impacting the confidence of schoolteachers. Police lodged the offence after conducting a preliminary inquiry on receiving the complaint from the school. Mevani along with the video had shared a text titled \u2018Barbarism of worst form\u2019. He named the school and asked his followers on social media to share the message \u201ctill the teacher is terminated and the school gets closed.\u201d \u201cIn that tweet, I had asked the Prime Minister\u2019s Office if the video was real?

There is more than meets the eye in registration of FIR in the matter. There won\u2019t be any FIR for kicking a woman in public but can be one for tweeting,\u201d said Mevani, claiming that he had shared the video to bring it to the notice of the authorities. Mevani deleted the post from his Twitter handle on May 21 and posted a clarification that he shared the video out of emotion. \u201cWe have booked the MLA and started investigation into the issue. We will register statements of all the concerned and collect evidences after which further action in the matter will be taken,\u201d Valsad district superintendent of police Sunil Joshi told TOI.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The MMF sector in the city employ about 15 lakh in power loom weaving units, embroidery units and textile processing units. About eight lakh workers are employed in power looms alone.

President of Pandesara Weavers Association, Ashish Gujarati said, \u201cFabric production has dipped by almost 30% in the last few months due to the shortage of workers in the weaving units.

US mulling 15% cap on H-1B visa for Indians\"The Trump Administration has no plans to place caps on H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally,\" a state department spokeswoman said in a statement in response to the Reuters article. While an administration's \"Buy American Hire American\" executive order calls for a broad review of US worker visa programs, including the H-1B programme, it was not targeted at a specific country, the spokeswoman said. It is \"completely separate from our ongoing discussions with India about the importance of ensuring the free flow of data across borders,\" the spokeswoman added. Earlier on Thursday, India said it was in talks with the United States on H-1B visas, but foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar told a news conference: \"We have not heard anything officially from the US government\" on capping such permits for Indians. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo is scheduled to visit New Delhi next week for talks that will include areas of disagreement between the two countries over trade. H-1B cap for India? It\u2019s not easy and may need approval by US Congress, say expertsTwo senior Indian officials told Reuters on Wednesday they had been briefed last week on a US plan to cap the number of H-1B visas given annually to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the total number issued. There is no country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas the United States issues every year, and an estimated 70% of them go to Indians.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel inaugurated Narmada Khand Udyog Sahakari Mandali Limited\u2019s ethanol manufacturing plant at Dahrikheda village in Narmada district on Saturday. The plant will produce 45,000 liters of ethanol per day, and the project is set up with an investment of Rs.60 crore. Addressing a gathering, Patel said: \u201cEarlier, molasses was produced from sugar cane, but it was not giving enough earnings to the sugar factories, and thus farmers could not be benefited. With the production of ethanol, there is an assured market, as the UPA government has made it mandatory to use at least 10% of biofuel into diesel and petrol.\u201d \u201cThe oil companies are the assured buyers of ethanol and other biofuels. Around eight sugar producing cooperatives are producing ethanol from molasses, whereas Narmada sugar has taken a lead to produce it directly from sugar cane which will reduce one step and increase productivity. A target to double the income of farmer will be achieved by such initiatives.\u201d he added. Ghanshyam Patel, chairman of Narmada Sugar Producer Cooperatives, said, \u201cOurs is a cooperative where a huge quantity of organic sugar is produced and more than 23,000 farmers are benefited financially.\u201d \u201cOrganic farming is another initiative taken up by the farmer shareholders and at present, farming in 5,000 hectors of land has already started.

Environmentalists and experts incorrect method of plantations and ineffective pruning techniques by the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) are responsible for this loss. They said there could be frequent repeats of such incidents if the SMC doesn\u2019t stop plantations before making footpaths or laying the road. Darshan Desai, environmentalist with NGO Prayas said, \u201cThe policy here is that SMC first makes footpaths or dividers and then plants the trees. This doesn\u2019t give any space to the roots of the trees to grow and spread. The are shallow and get uprooted easily during high speed winds.\u201d \u201cIn addition to that, people are also at fault. I have seen people pruning or trimming the trees that fall on their side on roads. This makes a tree lopsided and after rains when soil is wet, they gets uprooted because it cant bear the load on one side.\u201d According to Desai, the only solution to this is plantation should be done before the footpaths are constructed and if not, at least care must be taken that a plant is planted deep inside the earth where root can penetrate the soil and make its base firm by spreading its roots. Vijay Dixit, who regularly plants saplings in Athwalines said, \u201cThe new trees need to be given adequate space to establishing ground contact so that it doesn\u2019t become a big pot.\u201d Given the abysmal green cover, SMC\u2019s claims of having 15 lakh plus trees in city limits seem hollow. The fact that the city has not had tree census show that neither the ruling class nor the administration is serious about the issue. A last tree census conducted decade ago put the tree numbers at just 3.25 lakh . \u201c In absence of census, it is very difficult to arrive at a right number.

The entire road from Magdalla towards Vesu is facing the coal dust problem for a long time. Despite various representations by the environment activists to curb the nuisance of the coal spillage to the local authorities, the nuisance continues. Following state transport department\u2019s directive, the Regional Transport Office (RTO) had recently conducted a drive against the overloaded transport vehicles including the coal trucks plying on the Surat-Dumas road and collected lakhs of rupees as penalty from the coal transporters. But the issues of coal dust is yet to get settled. In the last two years, the Surat Municipal Corporation\u2019s (SMC) health department has collected fine to the tune of Rs 5 lakh from the coal distributors and truck owners for spilling dust on the road and despite several notices the transporters continue to ferry coal in the open truck, resulting in the dust to spill on the road.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Reason: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is yet to give the approval for raising the height of the ILS equipment. Sources said that the ILS system was made serviceable few months ago and the aircraft are using it for the safe landing. However, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had sought the approval for raising the height of its platform by 3.5 feet to protect the machines from getting damaged due to flooding in monsoon. The DGCA is sitting on the file for the past many months and the AAI is still awaiting its nod. Airport director, Sanjay Kumar Panigrahi said, \u201cIf heavy rains continue in the city for four to five days at a stretch, we fear that the ILS system would get submerged in flood waters. The spot where the ILS system is fitted is a low-lying one. In such circumstances, the ILS system would become non-operational and the aircraft would face difficulty in landing.\u201d It must be recalled that the ILS system was completely damaged in the last year monsoon when the airport area was flooded with more than five to six feet water. AAI had to spent lakhs of rupees for installing new ILS system, which was made operation sometime in January. Official sources said that the airport is located close to the Arabian Sea and that the ILS equipment hut site is set up in the low-lying area where the ground level is around three to four feet lower. Due to the insufficient water outlet available at the airport boundary, the combination of heavy rains coupled with high tide in the sea flood the airport area. With the Surat airport buzzing with more than 50 flights taking off or landing in a day, the non-existing ILS facility on the runway is causing immense difficulties for the pilots to safely land during the adverse weather conditions.

Police booked Mevani in Valsad town police station on Thursday for naming a Valsad school in a video shared on twitter in May in which students were being thrashed using a stick by a schoolteacher. Police suspect that Mevani shared the video and text with it, which was already viral on social media, without factcheck. Police booked Mevani under Indian Penal Code sections for publishing and circulating statement or rumour and defamation. Police also informed the speaker of state assembly about registering the offence. The complaint was lodged by Bijal Patel, principal of RM and VM Desai Sarvajanik Vidhyalay of Valsad. In her complaint Patel alleged that Mevani shared the video without any confirmation if it is true or not due to which it caused damage to the school\u2019s reputation and adversely impacted self-confidence of schoolteachers. Mevani shared the video on May 20, 2019. Along with the video Mevani shared a text titled \u2018Barbarism of worst form\u2019 and asked to share it widely. It came to the school\u2019s notice and they submitted an application to police. Following preliminary inquiry police lodged the complaint. \"In that tweet, I had asked a question to prime minister\u2019s office if the video is real. I had no intention to harm the school and I am ready to say sorry thousand times. Police could have asked my explanation before registering the offence and I doubt that there is something more behind registering the FIR,\u201d Mevani told TOI, claiming that he shared the video as it came and he shares any such videos to put it to notice of authorities. Hinting towards BJP MLA from Naroda Balram Thavani, Mevani, asked, \u201cThere won\u2019t be any FIR for kicking a woman in public but there can be one for tweeting?\u201d Thavani landed in controversy after his video kicking a woman went viral on social media. \"Police have booked the MLA and started investigation. We will register statements of all concerned and collect evidences after which further actions will be taken,\u201d said Sunil Joshi, SP, Valsad.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.
