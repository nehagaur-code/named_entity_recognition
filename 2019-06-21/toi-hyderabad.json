He sought blessings from his supporters for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and asserted that the NDA government has left no stone unturned to bring about development in the state. Land, air or space, we had courage to do surgical strikes: PM Modi\"The NDA government has been working hard to develop road and rail infrastructure in the state. There is no dearth of funds when it comes to development work in the country. \"In the last five years, the government has been able to build homes for eight lakh families, light up 3,000 houses and provide gas connections to 40 lakh homes,\" Modi stated. Referring to Mission Shakti, when India demonstrated anti-satellite (ASAT) missile capability by shooting down a live satellite, he said the government has taken measures to set up a 'chowkidar' (watchman) in space. He came down heavily on opposition parties who he said \"belittled\" the space achievement. \"Those that are criticising the anti-satellite technology will be given a befitting reply in the elections,\" he claimed, urging people to vote for a government that can take concrete decisions, not the one that only raises slogans.

Two years on, the doctor-turned-director is all set to retell the same story again in Hindi. When asked what it felt like to remake his own film in another language, Sandeep Reddy Vanga says, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t know why I made Arjun Reddy in Telugu. Probably because it is my mother tongue. But after the kind of response it got, I realised that the story I penned is universal and deserves to be told to a wider audience.\u201d In a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Hyderabad Times, the filmmaker gives a low down on what convinced him that Shahid was best suited to play Vijay Deverakonda\u2019s role, why he thinks Telanganites are a lot like Punjabis and how he doesn\u2019t get perturbed by the criticism that his protagonist is an epitome of toxic masculinity. Excerpts\u2026 From the trailers it seems like there is a slight shift in the tone of Kabir Singh when compared to Arjun Reddy. Was it intentional? No. There might be a little shift in tone because first of all, the language is different. The tonality of a Punjabi in Delhi is nowhere similar to that of a Telugu boy in Mangalore. Plus, life in medical colleges of North India is completely different from what it is like here down South. So, Kabir Singh will be a little different from Arjun Reddy even though the story and screenplay remain the same. However, there are a few scenes that I filmed for the Telugu version but didn\u2019t use; they will feature in the Hindi version. Also, I did chop down the length by 12 mins, it\u2019s 2-hours-50-minutes-long now. They say Telugus are the Punjabis of the South. It seems like you think so too, considering you chose to recast the Telangana boy Arjun Reddy into a Punjabi munda, Kabir Singh? (Laughs) A lot of people disagree with me, but I personally feel that there are a lot of similarities between us Telanganaites and Punjabis. We are as loud they are, we love to party the way they do, drinking, eating and dancing away to glory. I could easily imagine Kabir Singh doing the things Arjun Reddy did. I was only worried about the dialogues, because I wrote them in Telugu and they were very colloquial. Here I had to depend on a writer but thankfully, it was a smooth sail. What was the thought process behind casting Shahid, a 30-something-father-of-two, as a medical student? I don\u2019t know... maybe because of his previous work and because he\u2019s a good actor. I loved Shahid in Udta Punjab and Kaminey, so it was a no-brainer to cast him. Plus, if we keep aside the fact that he\u2019s been in the industry for 15 long years, to any outsider looking in, he wouldn\u2019t look old. Shahid transformed himself to look the part; he even lost weight on his face. Also, Kiara Advani looks nothing like Shalini Pandey...Kiara fits the bill perfectly to play Preeti; she has the innocence and timidness we needed. She looks every bit like the junior Kabir would fall in love with the second he saw her. How different was it working in Bollywood?I had a comfortable time there. Working with technicians and actors there is no different from here. The only annoying thing about Bombay is that no one wants to work before 11.30 in the morning. The first day I went to office at 9, even the jhaadu wali wasn\u2019t there yet. Everyone there is laidback, be it the technicians who do colour correction and editing or casting agents. When I would ask people to meet me early, they would look at me like I\u2019m crazy. Harshavardhan Rameshwar composed the BGM of Kabir Singh too. But why five different music directors for nine songs?I have never worked like this and if I\u2019m being honest, I was really sceptical of having a different composer for every song because the album as a whole needs to look balanced at the end of the day. But the balance is so right, it has turned into the best album of the year is what I\u2019ve been told. It was a little tiring to explain the film five different times to different people, but I realised every composer gave his best to the song he was composing. Arjun Reddy/Kabir Singh has been criticised as being chauvinistic\u2026 A hyper macho, self destructive hero who just has to have his way with everyone, even the girl he loves, isn\u2019t exactly the perfect role model for young men out there...You see, when you make art you always manage to upset someone or the other; it\u2019s been so for centuries now. To be honest, I don\u2019t even know why people call my film chauvinistic, but I don\u2019t feel bad about it nor do I feel the need to explain. when I took Arjun Reddy to the Censor Board, a lady there had asked me why my character goes to different classrooms and says the girl is his. I asked her, \u2018how is it different from a marriage? When a man ties the knot, he\u2019s essentially saying the same thing, in front of many people. My film doesn\u2019t pander to the male gaze with titillating cleavage and navel shots; no frame of mine is gratuitous. I honestly thought the Hindi audience and censor board would be a little more liberal, but it\u2019s no different. The lesson I\u2019ve learnt from this is that a director should always give himself time to deal with the censor board and the revising committee. Will you continue making Telugu films?Of course. In fact, my next film will be in Telugu, even though I don\u2019t know yet what it\u2019ll be about. I\u2019m penning a crime drama too. But, to be honest, I don\u2019t believe in the concept of being just a \u2018Hindi filmmaker\u2019 or \u2018Telugu filmmaker\u2019. There\u2019s no longer a language barrier. A pan-Indian film is easy to attempt.

You have to follow due process of law before initiating any action here, he said while hearing two separate petitions filed by Kinnera Buchakka and 24 others from Komatlagudem village and P Kannaiah and 23 others from Kodiselagattu village charging the officials with unlawfully evicting them from their dwellings and fields. Petitioners\u2019 counsel S Raj Kumar told the court that the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, accords rights to the traditional forest dwellers and in fact makes it obligatory for the officials to accord recognition to the tribals through granting of pattas etc. The petitioners belong to Koya tribe living in the forests for a very long time. They eke out their livelihood by collecting minor forest produces, through podu cultivation and by taking up manual labour works in the nearby villages, the counsel said. The officials have to hold Gram Sabhas and identify the people who have been living in the forest areas for a long time. Rights have to be conferred on them. They can evict only those who were not part of these villages, the counsel said. Forest dwellers have a right to protect, regenerate or conserve or manage any community forest resource, he said. Gram Sabha alone can determine the nature of individual and community rights under the Act, he said. State can constitute sub-division level committee to examine the resolutions of Gram Sabha, he said. The decisions taken by sub division committee can be challenged before a district level committee under the Act, he added. There should be a state level monitoring committee above these two committees. Without following any of this process, the forest officials have been forcibly evicting the tribals from their villages, Raj Kumar said. State counsel Narender Reddy, however, said that the officials will follow due process of law. The judge issued notices to authorities of home, panchayat raj and forest departments and sought counters from them by July 17.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Satta King 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-satta-matka/articleshow/65670358.cms", "time": "", "description": "NEW DELHI: Satta Matka is a form of gambling or lottery that had originated before the Independence of India.Originally, the game of Matka gambling involved betting on the opening and closing rates of cotton as transmitted to the Bombay Cotton Exchange from the New York Cotton Exchange, via teleprinters.The modern-day Matka gambling/ Satta King is based on random number selection and betting.

Excerpts: * How can we see you and your party colleagues move to join BJP at a time when you are facing the heat of central investigation and enforcement agencies?A week ago I met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asked him to examine the so-called allegations against me. I met PM Modi on Thursday too when finance minister Arun Jaitley got it examined with all agencies and he was satisfied. The PM also has the details of verification. I am the owner of my truth. In the interest of the nation, I have joined BJP * You are saying that there is no case against you?There is no cheating or forgery or any kind of case against me. No bank has filed a case. I am clean. I have an impeccable track record. I excelled in business and inspired several entrepreneurs. * Are the remaining two TDP MPs of Rajya Sabha also joining BJP?I am the leader of the party in Rajya Sabha. Most of the MPs followed me. I neither induced nor influenced them. It is their wish and will to join BJP. Two other RS MPs of TDP may also take a decision soon. * Did the TDP do a post-mortem examination after the election results?Coming out of NDA was a big blunder committed by the TDP. But we had to follow the then leader\u2019s decision. In India, no central government under any prime minister had supported Andhra Pradesh like the NDA had for four years. I had internally opposed the decision several times. Not only getting out of NDA, but also blaming central government is wrong. In a cooperative federal system, no PM or FM can give funds at the cost of other states. * Did you demand the resignation of Naidu after the general election? Are leaving him even though he gave you a Rajya Sabha seat?Who am I to demand his resignation? No doubt Chandrababu is a visionary and a hardworking leader. Leaving him is an incorrect word. He has to retire. Does anyone need to stay aboard a sinking Titanic till the last minute? I had my own plans to do something. I am a person who has accomplished everything in life. My children are disciplined and they got married and settled well. There are 3,000 to 4,000 people taking a salary from the companies I founded. I want to be active in politics so I joined BJP. * Do you think elevating Nara Lokesh\u2019s elevation as minister and general secretary of the party has affected the outcome of the elections?I cannot blame him. If the general secretary elections are held in a democratic process those who have fire in the belly like me would have contested. Chandrababu is a great person but he was misled by a few officers. Though he is out of the country, I was in touch with him and held discussions.

Earlier, people who wanted to pay court fee used to go to banks and transfer them into government account. Even cheque payment, too, used to be lengthy and time consuming mode. Now, online payment has been integrated into the servers of both SBI and high court. One can make the payment either through debit card, credit card or net-banking, and the payment particulars will be reflected in the records within no time. Litigants and lawyers can even take a print-out of their payment as proof, said an SBI officer who said that this digital initiative was first-of-its-kind introduced in the judiciary. E-Courts project may have initiated many other digital facilities, but the court fee payment has always been manual. Acting Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and SBI chief general manager Om Prakash Misra were present during the signing of the MoU at the high court judges\u2019 lounge on Wednesday evening. Registrar general A Venkateswar Reddy from the high court and deputy general manager Geetha S Pillai from SBI corporate wing signed the MoU.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

Sivaji claimed that he bought 40,000 shares from TV9 channel\u2019s former CEO Ravi Prakash at Rs 20 lakh and had also approached NCLT, urging it to stall the takeover of TV9 by the new management. Police suspect Sivaji was planted by Prakash to stall the change in management.

As judgment in Prakash anticipatory bail plea was reserved, he urged the court to adjourn the matter for a few days. The judge posted the case to June 26. Meanwhile, Justice Devi reserved judgment in a plea filed by Prakash seeking anticipatory bail. Pratap told the court that there was no truth in the allegations that the management of TV9 had resorted to hawala payments while selling 90% stake of the old management to the new management. It was bought for Rs 500 crore and the whole amount was paid in white through bank, he said, refuting the allegations made by Prakash. The public prosecutor said the action of the former CEO in selling the logo of the TV for Rs 99,000 was done with an intention to creating trouble for the new management.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

After analysing CC television footage and investigating the accidents, the cops say the 50 drivers, mostly truck and cab drivers, barring a few private car and two-wheelers, will have to give up their driving licence. Some two-wheelers and private car owners also figure in the list, police said. Once a licence is revoked, he or she will become ineligible to drive any vehicle. After brainstorming on ways to curb fatal accidents, a decision was taken by Cyberabad police to write letters, recommending cancellation of driving licences of those motorists, who were involved in deliberate negligence like wrong-side driving, cell phone driving or jumping signals, leading to accidents. \u201cWe have sent proposals to the transport department, asking them to revoke their driving licences as their deliberate negligence have led to accidents. We are waiting for a reply from the transport department,\u2019\u2019 an officer in the Cyberabad police told TOI. Till date, licences of motorists have been suspended, when they were caught either for drunken driving or other offences. Now, the officials have decided to invoke provisions under the MV Act to revoke licences of erring motorists. The recommendation was made citing Section 19 of the Motor Vehicle Act, which authorises the licensing authority to disqualify a person from holding a driving licence or revoke the licence. While transport authorities from the districts have already replied in the affirmative in some cases, police say they are waiting for responses from the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) in the city. In the past, Cyberabad police sought explanation from RTA on how driving licence were issued to motorists who had multiple traffic violations against them. The RTA official reportedly gave an explanation that since those motorists were eligible to apply and they passed the requisite exam, they issued them the permit. Police officials said that system of assigning points for various traffic violations is yet to be implemented for road accidents. \u201cThough, as per points system, for every road accident, a motorist is supposed to get five penalty points, but now accident information is not being integrated with traffic wing, yet,\u201d a source said.

The amalgam that apposed diametrically divergent and distinguishing styles was enthralling, to say the least.  the group started with Vande Mataram fused with Sare Jahan Se Achha, keeping in mind the Independene Day fervour. Sahaj Ma\u2019s deep voice and Godkhindi\u2019s classical vistar resounded in the auditorium. A peek into each performer\u2019s individual streams left listeners spellbound. Brooks\u2019 jazz fare with hints of Indian sounds, with tabla, drums and santoor thrown into the mix, was a hypnotic hybrid, undeniably unlike anything the audience had ever heard before.

The Siddipet MLA said the credit for the project should go to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. Harish Rao said when an irrigation project was deliberately designed by the previous governments, so that it could get caught in wrangles between various states, it was KCR who redesigned it. Describing KCR as \u2018Aparabhageerathudu\u2019, he said he had approached Maharashtra and settled the water issue amicable so that the Kaleshwaram project could be constructed. \u201cI would like to thank KCR for supervising the construction of the project and getting it done in record time,\u201d he said. Harish Rao said project engineers, employees and workers had worked through all seasons and in difficult weather conditions and congratulated them for their work. \u201cI salute the farmers of Telangana who are overwhelmed by the inauguration of the project. I pray to God that the dream of a green Telangana be realised,\u201d he said. Harish Rao ended his statement with \u2018Jai Telangana., Jai Kisan\u2019. Nowhere in the statement did he mention that he was the irrigation minister in the previous government under chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and worked on the execution of the project. It may be mentioned here that in KCR\u2019s second time after the assembly elections in December 2018, Harish Rao was not inducted into the cabinet. KCR himself kept the irrigation portfolio. The project will be inaugurated on Friday. Meanwhile, Former union minister and BJP leader Bandaru Dattatreya said the Telangana government was hurriedly inaugurating the Kaleshwaram project without completing it. \"The three completed barrages Medigadda, Annaram and Sundilla and other works constitute only 20 per cent of the entire project. The balance works in the Phase I about 30 per cent are at snail pace, land acquisition was not completed for the balance 50 per cent of the works,\" the former minister said. He said when the project was conceived, the cost was about Rs 38,000 crore but the Telangana government enhanced the project cost in the name of redesigning. Dattatreya demanded the state government to place the detailed project report of Kaleshwaram project before the public and also demanded to publish a white paper on the irrigation project costs (both original and revised) and amount spent so far.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

Due to the lopsided work, Begumpet, Masab Tank, PVNR, Greenlands and Telugu Thalli flyovers could face heavy waterlogging. Experts said Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) engineers should also take the blame for failing to inspect the road restoration works while they were being executed. Since a majority of the works were carried out at night, labourers, with no proper guidance and supervision, laid bitumen on the flyover vents also without realising that it would be a big hazard for commuters during the rainy season.

However, 32 years later, there\u2019s no word about the 11.193kg or 1,000-mohur gold coin inherited by titular Nizam VIII, Mukarram Jah, from his grandfather and last Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan, in 1967. The gold coin was minted during the regime of Mughal emperor Jahangir. Along with this 1,000-mohur gold coin, a 2.3kg gold coin minted during Shah Jahan\u2019s rule, is also put up for auction. Days before the auction, the Indian government had intervened, stating that the coins are part of the national heritage. Since the unsuccessful auction in 1987, the whereabouts of the coins are not known, says city historian Dr Mohammad Safiullah. Another precious object of the Nizam that has remained a mystery for decades is the Nizam diamond. There have been no records of any international auction house selling it or putting it up for auction. The Nizam diamond, also known as little Kohinoor, was mined from the Krishna river valley in Krishna-Guntur districts. Incidentally, the Kollur diamond mine, which produced some of the famous diamonds in the world, is now submerged under the water of Pulichintala dam. The Nizam diamond was mined in 1830 and went missing a few years after the Police Action in 1948. State archival data reveals that the Nizam diamond was present in 1944 and the India office in London had sought its details. This had angered the Nizam and he refused to divulge details about the Nizam or Golconda diamond and other precious stones and gems in his possession. Dr Safiullah said the 1,000-mohur gold coin came into the hands of the Asaf Jahs after it was presented by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to Ghaziuddin Khan Siddiqi Bahadur, father of Nizam-ul-Mulk, founder of the Asaf Jah dynasty. The 1,000-mohur coin contains Persian couplets. Such coins were minted not for circulation but for presentation to royal dignitaries or faithful nobles, he said.

This is the third time that the TDP is in a deep political crisis since its formation in 1982, and on two occasions the party president was on foreign tour at the time of the crisis. On one occasion, the TDP supremo was away from the state capital. In a surprise move, four of the six Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MPs in Rajya Sabha joined the BJP on Thursday in the presence of its newly-appointed working president, J P Nadda. The MPs, including Y S Chowdary, C M Ramesh, Garikapati Mohan Rao and T G Venkatesh, also gave a letter to Vice-President and Rajya Sabha chairman, M Venkaiah Naidu, requesting him to allow the TDP parliamentary party to merge into the BJP. August is generally regarded as a 'month of bad omen' in TDP circles, as party founder NT Rama Rao had lost chief ministership twice in August. This time, the crisis has knocked at TDP's doors two months earlier. The party had, however, survived the earlier two crisis though Rama Rao could not retain power on one occasion. The TDP was in power on two occasions. The TDP plunged into a political crisis for the first time in August 1984. Rama Rao, who was the chief minister then, went to the USA for heart surgery. In his absence, a political coup was meticulously planned and executed by his cabinet colleague Nadendla Bhaskar Rao. Rama Rao had the strength in the state assembly but he had to take to the streets to force the governor to conduct a floor test. Bhaskar Rao resigned a month later and Rama Rao was reinstated as CM. In the second political crisis in August 1995, Rama Rao was away in Srikakulam district launching 'government-at-people's-doorsteps' programme, when his son-in-law and then revenue minister N Chandrababu Naidu executed a political coup, dethroning him from chief ministership. Naidu then took over the reins of undivided AP. Rama Rao, who was forced to form NTR-TDP, died in January 1996 before the general elections held in May. The latest crisis has come at a time when incidentally TDP supremo and former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu is holidaying in Europe. Chowdary, Ramesh and Rao were among Naidu's closest aides. The TDP was virtually decimated in the recent general elections as it won only 23 assembly seats in a House of 175. Also, the party got just three Lok Sabha seats out of 25. Sources close to Chowdary told TOI that at least 12 of the newly elected TDP MLAs and one Lok Sabha MP were in touch with BJP leaders and could switch sides any time.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

A flagship scheme of the TRS government and considered to be the world\u2019s biggest multi-stage lift irrigation project, Kaleshwaram, in many ways, is an engineering marvel in terms of massive underground pump houses, power pumps and underground tunnels. The mega project is meant to divert 195 tmcft of water from Godavari, covering a distance of 199km in the state, and utilise the water to irrigate 45 lakh acres \u2014 covering almost 70% of the state \u2014 in 13 districts, apart from providing drinking water to thousands of villages and industries. KCR has spared no efforts to make it a grand affair, inviting his counterparts in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra \u2014 YS Jaganmohan Reddy and Devendra Fadnavis respectively \u2014 and governor ESL Narasimhan for the inauguration. The cost of the project is set to touch a staggering Rs 1 lakh crore from the initial Rs 80,196 crore \u2014 which is almost equal to the state budget four years ago. About half a dozen ministers are overseeing arrangements at various project sites such as Medigadda, Kannepally, Annaram, Sundilla, Nandi Medaram and other areas. Six helipads are being readied and the state government has engaged four choppers to bring Fadnavis, officials, governor and other officials, while Jagan will fly in his own chopper to the project site at Medigadda. One helipad is kept as a backup in case of emergency. \u201cFor the first time, bank officials belonging to the consortium of 20 banks which have financed the project have also been invited for the inauguration,\u201d KCR said. The government took Rs 35,000 crore loan from various banks and irrigation officials will show the bankers where the amount has been spent. Health minister Eatala Rajender told TOI that the chief ministers will attend pujas at Medigadda, while a formal inauguration would be held at the Kannepally pump house. The uniqueness of the project is the biggest and crucial underground pumping station at Ramadugu (package 8) in Karimnagar district. Irrigation officials claim that each single electrical pump (Bahubali pumps) that was installed is so huge that it can fill the Hussainsagar lake in just a couple of days. If all the seven pumps with a capacity of 139 MW are switched together, they can discharge 21,000 cusecs, which is a rare feat in the irrigation sector. \u201cRamadugu pumping station can lift 3 tmcft a day. The pump house is located at a depth of 330 metres. Surge pool and additional surge pools of this pump house are the biggest in the world. For the first time, such constructions were taken up underground,\u201d Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Ltd (MEIL) director B Srinivas Reddy told TOI. While MEIL executed the project, BHEL developed and supplied required pumps. Works at the Medigadda barrage itself created a record as 90,055 cubic metres of reinforced cement concrete was laid in a single day by L&T on the spillway and piers last year. Telangana CM Chandrasekhar Rao on several occasions said generally any irrigation project takes several decades to complete the works, but Kaleshwaram project is being completed (phase I) in a record time of three years and giving water to the farmers.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

The bench said that a total of 3.82 lakh students had failed, and the reverification resulted in a mere 1,183 students securing pass marks and this cannot be described as a huge discrepancy.

The Siddipet MLA said the credit for the project should go to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. Harish Rao said when an irrigation project was deliberately designed by the previous governments, so that it could get caught in wrangles between various states, it was KCR who redesigned it. Describing KCR as \u2018Aparabhageerathudu\u2019, he said he had approached Maharashtra and settled the water issue amicable so that the Kaleshwaram project could be constructed. \u201cI would like to thank KCR for supervising the construction of the project and getting it done in a record time,\u201d he said.

It may be mentioned here that in KCR\u2019s second time after the assembly elections in December 2018, Harish Rao was not inducted into the cabinet. KCR himself kept the irrigation portfolio.

Former Union minister YS Chowdary, CM Ramesh, TG Venkatesh and Garikapati Mohan Rao announced TDP\u2019s merger with the BJP in the Rajya Sabha. Now many MLAs and former MLAs may follow suit. TDP has 23 MLAs and it might be difficult for party president N Chandrababu Naidu to keep the flock together. TDP survived a similar crisis when the Congress was in power in the state during 2004-2014. Naidu could revive TDP\u2019s fortunes thanks to the hurried bifurcation of the state that decimated the Congress. The comparison between Jagan and Naidu in 2014 helped the veteran Naidu clinch victory over the young leader as people thought his experience in the administration would help heal bifurcation injuries. Analysts say BJP is keen to eliminate TDP in the state in order to occupy the political space. Naidu\u2019s troubles began when he quit the NDA. His aggressive campaign against Prime Minister Narendra Modi made him BJP\u2019s enemy No.1. There was speculation about Sujana Chowdary joining BJP for long, but it came too early for Naidu. TG Venkatesh said he had informed Naidu last week. \u201cNaidu asked me not to take any hasty decision, but I made up my mind in the interest of the state,\u201d said Venkatesh. The split in TDP is expected to encourage more defections from the party. Sources said BJP has accepted to take the defectors on board as it has no majority in the Upper House to clear crucial constitutional amendment bills. TDP has six members in Rajya Sabha.

I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

Alerted by this, the revenue department is now trying to stop the auction and recover the land parcel. The revenue department realised that the land was pledged with UCO Bank after producer Burugupalli Sivaramakrishna failed to clear Rs 11 crore to the bank, which initiated the process to auction the land to recover its loan amount. Officials of the asset management branch of UCO Bank at Somajiguda recalled that Sivaramakrishna, proprietor of Sree Venkateswara Art Films, took a loan from the bank by pledging one acre of a total 10 acres in survey number 80/A in Hafeezpet village of Serilingampally mandal.

In-patient services were also affected at state-run hospitals due to staff crunch. TimesViewRegular strikes by medicos have crippled healthcare services in the state. Taking note of how patients are suffering, the government should intervene immediately and persuade the doctors to call off their protest. Healthcare is a priority sector and must be treated in the same manner. Authorities should hold talks with all stakeholders to break the impasse, so that poor patients, who depend on state-run facilities, are not affected and get proper treatmentApart from boycotting elective duties, junior doctors at teaching hospitals, including Niloufer Hospital, Government Maternity Hospital in Petlaburj, Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital, MNJ Cancer Hospital and Chest Hospital, also joined the protest. Only two doctors were available at Government Maternity Hospital in Petlaburj. The doors for emergency wards at OGH and Gandhi were frequently being shut to prevent the entry of large number of patients. Many patients were also seen arguing with security guards. \u201cWe came all the way from Warangal but were not allowed to enter the casualty ward for almost four hours,\u201d said Razia Begum, who came with her husband. In fact, many families were putting up at hospitals for the last three days or more. Around 10 attendants, who came with a patient from Harshaguda, were putting up at OGH for the last three days. \u201cWe brought our niece here after she developed fits. She is being treated at the hospital but there are very few doctors available,\u201d said Lashamma, one of the relatives. Members of Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA) said they will go on a hunger strike on Friday, while continuing to boycott elective duties. TJUDA also wrote a letter to Governor ESL Narasimhan, demanding immediate recruitment of assistant professors, abolition of contract recruitment of doctors and setting up a committee on age hike. \u201cThe government of Telangana took a unilateral and hasty decision for increasing retirement age of teaching faculty in government teaching hospitals from 58 to 65 years and is preparing for issuance of ordinance,\u201d the letter read. Listing various reasons for not increasing the retirement age, the letter asked for a committee to be formed to decide on the matter as \u201cthe proposed age hike will be a huge loss to young doctors\u201d.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The Congress leader hit out at BJP's strategy of playing the nationalist card. \"We are Congress\u2026 we launched the freedom movement\u2026 gave our blood and sweat\u2026 braved British atrocities \u2026 we don't need any certificate to prove our nationalist feelings especially from the ones who apologised to the British at that time\", asserted Priyanka, urging the workers to go to every household in their area and meet every voter. She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022. And once we come, we will stay here for long on the basis of our hard work,\" she said adding that the hard-workers would be adequately rewarded.

On Wednesday, YSRCP workers in a village in Guntur constructed a wall across a road to prevent TDP workers from using it. In another incident, YSRCP workers in Prakasam district dug up a cement road laid by the previous TDP government about 10 months ago alleging that the people using the road had not voted for YSRCP in the assembly polls. The police had to intervene in both villages to maintain law and order. A picket was posted at Ponugupadu village of Phirangipuram mandal in Guntur district where a three-feet wall was raised blocking the village thoroughfare. Since incident has a caste angle, the police held a peace meeting between the rival TDP and YSRCP groups. A majority of TDP supporters are from an upper caste, while YSRC supporters belong to Scheduled Castes. YSRC supporters have claimed the wall was built to prevent encroachment by TDP men as the land used for the road was on private property, but TDP supporters maintained the road belonged to revenue department and was been used for the last 80 years. Phirangipuram SI D Srihari said the claims have been referred to the revenue department and in the meantime the area has been kept out of bounds for public. Earlier, there have been incidents of demolition of flag posts and party arches and attacks on political opponents in Narasaraopet, Sattenapalli, Macherla and Gurazala assembly constituencies in Guntur district. These constituencies fall under Palnadu region, once known for its faction feuds. In the other incident at Uppalapadu village in Kanigiri assembly constituency in Prakasam district, a cement road was dug up with an excavator. The road was laid at Muslim Colony around 10 months ago. The road was dug up as the residents allegedly supported the TDP candidate in the just-concluded assembly elections. A complaint has been lodged with the police. Meanwhile, the situation at Manchikallu, Pinnelli, Machavaram Mutyalampadu and Tangeda villages turned serious as local TDP leaders fled fearing attacks. About 70 families in Pinnelli supported the TDP in the recent elections. They are now taking shelter at Gamalapadu near Dachepalli. They met Guntur rural SP seeking protection. As many as 15 cases have been registered in Narasaraopet, Sattenapalli and Gurazala police sub-divisions since the election results. A little over 40 people were injured in the clashes that broke out after the polls. Guntur rural SP R Jayalakshmi told TOI that the situation by and large was peaceful in Palnadu region. There have been some incidents of clashes in some areas, but all issues have been addressed, she said, adding that cases have been booked against the attackers. \u201cPolice teams are holding counselling sessions for village elders, apart from rounding up history-sheeters,\u201d she said.
