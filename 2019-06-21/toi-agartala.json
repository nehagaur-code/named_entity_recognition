Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Special secretary to Tripura government looking after industries and commerce Kiran Gitte, who was also present, said the project will be implemented by the Land Port Authority of India like the Akhaura ICP in Agartala. In the last few years, efforts to provide access to the Chittagong port in Bangladesh, 70 km from Sabroom town, gained importance in the Act East policy of the central government. After the BJP-led government came to power in Tripura last year, chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb put in extra efforts to harness the benefits of the Chittagong port to boost trade with Southeast Asian countries. In December, 2018, the ministry of shipping had signed an agreement with the Government of Bangladesh to allow transportation of goods from Chittagong port and work on the bridge over the Feni river is progressing well to connect Tripura with the port, Gitte said. He added that the state government has sent a proposal to the ministry of home affairs to construct an ICP at Sabroom in 2016.

Unbearably hot and humid conditions have been prevailing in the region since June 1. On Wednesday, the capital experienced scorching heat with the temperature shooting up to 37 degrees Celsius, the highest in the northeast. North Lakhimpur recorded a maximum temperature of 36.2 degree Celsius during the day followed by Silchar and Dhubri-35.7 and 35.2 degree Celsius respectively. While Agartala recorded a maximum temperature of 36.8 degree Celsius, the rising temperature inched up to 35 degree Celsius in Itanagar. Met officials said the maximum temperature in northeastern towns and cities was 3 to 5 degrees above normal on Wednesday. \"A low pressure area is likely to develop over the north Bay of Bengal and its neighbouring areas in the next two to three days. As a result, less moisture is being carried from the Bay of Bengal to the northeast, causing the unusual heat. Besides, there is less cloud formation causing direct sunshine on the earth's surface,\" said a senior official at the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) in Guwahati. What is, however, more worrying is the deficit rainfall the northeastern states have experienced since June 1, when the monsoon season begins climatologically. RMC data stated that at 65% deficit, Manipur recorded the highest deficit from June 1 to 18. This was followed by 46% deficit in Assam and 37% deficit in Mizoram. The shortage of rainfall in other states of the region are-Arunachal Pradesh 36%, Meghalaya 35%, Tripura 27% and Nagaland 14%. In contrast, in the initial days of the monsoon season in NE, Meghalaya received the highest rainfall of 289.1 mm, followed by Tripura at 225.8 mm. But both were not adequate. While Arunachal Pradesh recorded 172.5 mm rainfall, Mizoram and Assam experienced 157.7 mm and 134.1 mm respectively. It was followed by Nagaland (131.9 mm) and Manipur (90.6 mm). Met officials, however, said that in the next 48 to 72 hours, rainfall activity may enhance as conditions are becoming favourable for further advancement of the Southwest monsoon into the remaining parts of the northeast and cover the entire region in the next 2-3 days.

The scavenger bird, which plays a vital role in cleaning up the environment, is suffering a decline in population due to a range of threats, including diclofenac poisoning and habitat destruction. Niraj Kumar Chanchal, the divisional forest officer (DFO) of Khowai, said 26 vultures were spotted at Kalyanpur area along the river bank and more than 10 at Chebri area. We are planning to build a restaurant for vultures in Kalyanpur and Chebri so that these birds do not run out of food. We would supply carcasses of animals at their resting and roosting places, Chanchal told PTI. A survey carried out by former chief wildlife warden Atul Gupta has shown that South Tripura and Sipahijala are the two other districts in the state, where the bird has been sighted in considerable numbers. \"Vultures are an important part of the eco-system. They maintain a balance between the living and the dead by devouring carcasses. Among the nine species of the birds sighted in the country, white-rumped vulture found in Tripura has been identified as critically endangered, Gupta said. Chanchal attributed the recent increase in numbers in Tripura to favourable habitat and non-use of diclofenac pills. \"Although India has banned manufacture of diclofenac tablets, a pain killer, for animals, the pills are being manufactured for human use. The farmers often illegally use these tables to treat cattle. Vultures, overdosed with diclofenac are unable to lay eggs. In Tripura, however, farmers and herders do not use the drug as it is a costly one, he added. The forest official also observed that big and solitary trees, along a waterbody, are ideal for 'roosting and resting' of the endangered species. \"We have seen vultures roosting on Shimul trees. So, we started a drive to plant as many Shimul trees as possible on the river banks,\" he said. The Bombay Nature History Society, in a report, said India once had a total vulture population of 20 million, which, by 2009, dipped to one per cent of the figure. Prasenjit Biswas, an ornithologist who authored The Last Flight of the Vulture, said human incursion and unavailability of food were the major reasons behind the decline in population. The Rudra Sagar Lake, its surroundings and the Sipahijala sanctuary, with its large lakes and forests, used to be a favourite haunt of the white-rumped vultures till the late eighties, he rued. \"Human corpses are rarely dumped in the open, while animal carcasses are safely disposed off. This has deprived the vultures of their livelihood,\" Biswas, who has been studying the movements and traits of vultures for over a decade, added.

Jubilant cries of 'Ako Ebar Modi Sarkar' (Modi government once again) rent the air at the party headquarters in Guwahati and party offices across Assam as the saffron party bagged the maximum number of seats of the 14 Lok Sabha seats. Hundreds of party members jammed the Atal Bihari Vajpaye Bhawan, before counting started at 8 am. In 2014, BJP had scripted its success story in the northeast by winning seven out of the 14 seats. This time, the saffron party is set to win nine seats, including the minority-dominated Karimganj (SC) seat in the Barak valley. \"We were flooded with sweets. Nearly 25,000 people came to our office to celebrate,\" a BJP office assistant said. \"This is the victory of the people of Assam who have expressed their trust in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Our karyakartas (workers) toiled for months. The entire country is celebrating,\" said Assam BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass. \"With the victory comes responsibility. Our government in the state and at the Centre are committed to fulfilling the aspirations of the people, who experienced the fruits of development in the last five years,\" Dass said. Celebrations also marked the day at the party's northeast office at Uzanbazar. \"This is the day we all longed for. Even people who are not members of BJP rejoiced,\" said Naba Kumar Baishya, BJP's media co-convener. In Dibrugarh, as BJP candidate Rameswar Teli surged ahead, his supporters broke out into loud cheers. Ladoos and sweets were distributed. At the local BJP office in Amolapatty, jubilant party workers danced to drumbeats amid bursting of crackers. Similar scenes of euphoria were witnessed at the residence of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal at Lakhinagar. \"The celebrations have been on since morning. We knew BJP would win. The credit goes to the dynamic leadership of Narendra Modi,\" said youth leader Parag Dutta. In contrast, the Congress party office at Phoolbagan was deserted throughout the day. With the defeat of the Congress candidate Paban Singh Ghatowar becoming obvious after every round of counting, supporters started thinning out. The picture was different in the former Left bastion Tripura capital Agartala, where the city looked deserted in the morning. Shops were closed and attendance was thin in government offices. But the mood changed in the afternoon. Celebrations broke out. Chief minister Biplab Deb, his cabinet colleagues and party leaders congratulated the winners. BJP workers organised a series of rallies with Pratima Bhowmik in different locations of Tripura West and Rebati Tripura in Dhalai. \"This is the victory of the people of Tripura. They have extended support to Modiji for a better India,\" said Bhowmik. \"The BJP-IPFT government led by chief minister Deb worked hard and was able to infuse faith in the people. Voters have rejected the conspiracy of CPM and Congress against the government. In the next five years, Tripura will see development at par with the rest of the country,\" she added. Rebati Tripura, who won from the Tripura East seat, said the victory of BJP in the tribal-reserved seat has clearly indicated the faith of the indigenous people in Modi. The Communists and Congress did not do anything for the tribals. \"BJP has instilled faith in the tribal population. During the next four years, the state will witness a lot of change,\" said Tripura.

All outpatient departments in government medical hospitals and a large number of private hospitals remained closed. However, emergency services remained unaffected. In Assam, about 3,000 doctors and medical officers, who are members of the IMA, joined the protest.

President of Manipur State Branch of IMA, Shyamkumar Laishram, condemned the attack on junior doctors in Kolkata. Doctors and medical staff sat on protest, carrying banners reading \"Doctors are not enemy\", \"We want a national law against hospital violence\", \"Doctors can only treat but not save life\", \" Justice must be given to the culprit\" and \"We stand for Dr Paribaha Mukherjee of NRS Medical College\". In Agartala, healthcare services were severely affected, with doctors and medical staff joining in the protest wearing black badges. The Tripura branch of IMA and the All Tripura Government Doctors' Association extended their support to nationwide protest. OPD services remained suspended in almost all major hospitals, including the Agartala Government Medical College. Arunachal also presented a similar picture, with OPDs remaining closed in all hospitals, including Tomo Riba Institute of Medical and Health Science (TRIHMS) in the state capital.

TRIHMS doctors addressed a meeting, highlighting the atrocities on doctors in the state.

Exactly a week ago, Deb removed chief secretary LK Gupta. At present, CM's principal secretary Kumar Alok has been given the charge. The notification issued by the chief secretary on Friday night reads, \"The governor, with the advice of chief minister, ceased Sudip Roy Barman to be a member of the council of ministers.\" His portfolios of health, drinking water and sanitation and IT will be looked after by the CM. Deputy CM Jishnu Dev Varma will look after science, technology and environment. With Roy Barman's exclusion, the size of the state cabinet has reduced to eight members. Differences between the CM and the heath minister first developed last year when Roy Barman convened a meeting of all block-level officers and executives of the city and towns on drinking water and sanitation without consulting the CM. Finally, at the instruction of Deb, his principal secretary and present chief secretary (in-charge) Kumar Alok had stopped field-level officers from attending the meeting at the eleventh hour by sending text messages. This further widened the rift. Roy Barman, however, accused Alok of misguiding the chief minister to create differences in the cabinet and had termed him as a 'black sheep' in the administration. The chief minister, on the other hand, reviewed the activities of the departments Roy Barman was looking after without inviting the minister concerned a number of times. Gradually, the interactions between Deb and the Roy Burman became very infrequent and formal. Sources said the chief minister was also told that the health minister was allegedly working against him and BJP. Roy Barman, despite being the committee member of BJP the West Tripura Lok Sabha, was hardly seen holding political meetings. A day before the first phase of polls on April 11, an on-duty doctor of the state referral hospital was attacked after which doctors launched a movement seeking security. Questioning the law and order situation in the state, Roy Barman went a step further by giving up his escort. He had stated that he will go around without any security until proper security arrangements were made for doctors.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

It will be replaced by annual evaluation in Class V and Class VIII from this academic session. \"The state government has decided to re-introduce the pass-fail system in Tripura this year.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life.

Sources said CPM's district committee office in Ambassa was forcibly closed and the leaders were asked to pay at least Rs 1 lkah each to save their lives and properties.

But if the work is hampered due to the monsoon season or any other factor, then the declaration would be made by early 2020,\" Roy said. The AAI had undertaken a Rs 438-crore project to upgrade the Agartala airport to international standard by providing world-class facilities. \"The budgeted expenditure of Rs 438 crore is expected to be escalated. However, our government is constantly asking the AAI to have the work completed early and maintain the stipulated standards,\" the minister added. Chief Minister Biplab Deb also recently discussed with the civil aviation minister in New Delhi the issue of upgrading the Agartala airport, which was built in 1942 by the then King Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman Manikya Bahadur. According to an official in the Chief Minister's Office, the Union civil aviation minister Raj Kumar Singh has agreed to Deb's request to expedite the work. The airport in Agartala is the second busiest in the northeast after Guwahati's Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport. The Imphal airport was declared as an international one two years ago. During the World War II, the Agartala airport was used by the 4th Combat Cargo Group of the US Army Air Forces 10 Air Force, flying Curtiss C-46 Commando aircraft over Myanmar. It was used as a supply point from which the unit air-dropped supplies and ammunition to the advancing Allied forces on the ground. Following the completion of the project, Singha Roy said flights between Agartala and Dhaka, as well as other Bangladeshi cities like Chittagong and Sylhet, will be operated. \"The state government has already provided 72 acres of land to the AAI for construction of the new terminal building, runway and other necessary infrastructure.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "TNEA Rank List 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/tnea-2019-rank-list-to-be-released-today-tneaonline-in/articleshow/69868592.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Lesser known facts about Gurmeet Choudhary": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/lesser-known-facts-about-gurmeet-choudhary/photostory/65672397.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Tripura MLA marries woman he was accused of raping": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/tripura-mla-marries-woman-he-was-accused-of-raping/articleshow/69733864.cms", "time": "2019-06-11 13:42:00", "description": "AGARTALA: Following weeks of legal and political pressure, IPFT legislator Dhananjoy Tripura on Sunday married the woman he is accused of raping and deceiving. \"I married her at Chaturdas Devata temple in Agartala,\" Dhananjoy told the media on Monday. The woman said she will withdraw all cases against the MLA. Dhananjoy, 28, represents the Raima Valley constituency in the Tripura assembly. Last week, the Tripura high court had rejected Dhananjoy's anticipatory bail plea and sought a report from police explaining why \"marriage was not solemnised in a time-bound manner\". The public prosecutor had then told the court that the accused had been absconding and attempts to arrest him had failed. Dhananjoy, however, maintained that he had been \"framed\" as part of a political conspiracy. IPFT insiders, meanwhile, said party leaders had been displeased with the \"dispute\" and had advised Dhananjoy to marry the woman. The woman had filed a case against him on May 20 at the Agartala women's police station, accusing Dhananjoy of raping and deceiving her by not marrying her. 'Was still in school when I met Dhananjoy for the first time'I was still in school when we met in 2010. He was a college student at Jirania. A year later, we got involved and I had been to his house several times. He had then promised to marry me. I was physically abused but I did not think he would deny our relations,\" she had told the police. She took up the matter with IPFT president NC Debbarma, who held \"reconciliation meetings\" between them and arrived at a March 2017 wedding date. Because of the assembly election, however, the wedding was postponed several times. The woman said Dhananjoy stopped all contact after he was elected as an MLA in February 2018. In December 2018, it was decided that the wedding would be solemnized in April this year. However, Dhananjoy was a no-show again. \"When our family asked what had happened, his elder brother demanded Rs 8 lakh from us. When we refused, Dhananjoy said he would not marry me,\" she had told the police. Her mother had said they were left with no option and had to take the matter to the police. \"He was charged with rape by promising to marry the girl, cheating and breach of trust,\" she added.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

Justice Arindam Lodh issued the notice to EC on Saturday seeking its response by Monday. Datta had filed the writ on Thursday in HC on the direction of Supreme Court, where he had sought an intervention for fresh election in Tripura West on the grounds of large scale irregularities and manipulation of poll process in the first phase of polling on April 11. However, EC counsel Shaktimoy Chakraborty told the court that the poll panel would submit a \"counter reply\" to the original writ petition. The court granted the counsel's request and fixed Tuesday as the date for next hearing. The CPM candidate in his writ petition had sought fresh election in Tripura West claiming around 50% voters of the constituency could not cast their vote on April 11 due to large scale rigging, booth capturing and intimidation. The petition also mentioned that the returning officer, too, had filed adverse report on polling in 433 booths. The EC, however, in a meeting with a Congress delegation on Friday made it clear that there is no scope of holding fresh polls in Tripura West as special observer Vinod Zutshi had overruled the initial report of the returning officer citing irregularities in 433 booths. Five days after the polling, Tripura West returning officer Dr Sandeep M Mahatme in a report had stated that election process was vitiated in 433 out of 1,679 polling stations. He mentioned that many polling officials had reported irregularities in 65 booths while 368 booths did not have video footage of around nine hours. While reviewing the footage and reports of presiding officers and micro observers, the returning officer was convinced that polling officials had not reported the alleged malpractices during polling properly and accordingly FIRs were lodged against many of them and disciplinary proceedings were initiated. Based on Mahatme's report, Congress moved the EC and later the Supreme Court seeking fresh polling in Tripura West. The EC's decision to order repolling in 168 booths failed to satisfy both Congress and CPM. While the CPM candidate filed the writ in HC, Congress is waiting for SC hearing. The EC, meanwhile, has summoned a Congress delegation to New Delhi to hold talks on their demand for fresh poll.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

In addition, the CM has also sent DGP AK Shukla on long leave. According to sources, soon after assuming office as CM last year, Deb had expressed his displeasure over the administrative functioning of Tripura. Though he was born and raised in Tripura, Deb's career in politics was started in Delhi in a different set up. Deb was trained under RSS leaders like Gobindacharya. He had worked closely with top BJP leaders and several central ministers. But soon after he got involved in Tripura politics as BJP prachar pramukh in 2015, Biplab started facing problems due to the work culture and functioning of the party. Later, when he joined as BJP state president, Deb was able to sway the voters by his relentless efforts, which is unusual in Tripura politics. As soon as he took charge as CM, Deb served till midnight just to learn the administration. The security people in the civil secretariat and even his first principal secretary Lalit Kumar Gupta (CS who was removed) expressed their inability to work till late at night. \"He was desperately looking for officers who are habituated to his style of work. Deb started Janadarbar at the secretariat to dispose of cases of public grievances which was not accepted by many in the administration as time-bound action and reporting him back appeared to be problematic for them,\" said a close associate of the CM. The chief minister had suspended as many as 16 officers during his field visit in the last one year for their unsatisfactory performance, which made officials of the state cadre hostile. Taking advantage of the CM's displeasure, a section of bureaucrats poisoned him against Roy Barman and a group of senior officers, a source said.

While hearing the contempt petition on Tuesday, the bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Arindam Lodh, observed that their order of ensuring non-plying of converted paddle rickshaws was flouted by the administration as well as the state government. Hearing a Public Interest Litigation, the court had found that the converted manual rickshaws were the most risky modes of transportation. The manually regulated rickshaws have got high speed after they were converted resulting in a large number of accidents and even the death of a child last year. Since there is no safety mechanism in the rickshaw or not covered by insurance, the passengers have no protection. State advocate general Arun Bhowmik argued that about 10,000 such paddle rickshaws had been converted into motor driven ones and now the state government is faced with a challenge of livelihood issues. However, the state government has been working on an alternative plan. The court turned down the argument saying protection of life is more important than the livelihood of those rickshaw pullers who had illegally converted the paddle rickshaws. The court directed the district magistrate, West Tripura, SP West Tripura and SP Traffic besides, the municipal commissioner to swing into action to execute the order immediately. Otherwise, they will be held personally responsible for non-compliance.

Soon after the results, there were reports of workers of the ruling BJP launching attacks on their CPM and Congress counterpart. In a counterattack on BJP workers in Fatikcherra, Sadhan Debnath and two of his brothers, Uttam Debnath and Rajkumar Debnath, reportedly killed Mithu Bhowmik with a sharp weapon. Sanjib Laskar, who was with Mithu, was also badly injured and shifted to the ICU of Agartala Govt Medical College (AGM). The three main accused, who are suspected to have reportedly killed BJP worker Mithu and attempted to murder Sanjib, have been arrested. Though local sources said the accused carried out the attack on BJP in retribution to attack by saffron party workers on the opposition, it could not be ascertained which party the trio belongs to. Post-poll violence have been raging in Tripura for the last two days, with as many 123 supporters of ruling BJP and opposition CPM and Congress have been injured in the violence in the last two days. Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb said he has issued strict orders to the DGP to take action against those involved in the murder of Mithu. Deb, who is Delhi now to meet the BJP national president Amit Shah and general secretary Ram Madhav, has already spoken to the DGP regarding the matter. \"I told the DGP, senior police officials, and TSR commandants to conduct security drills in vulnerable areas to prevent post-poll violence,\" Deb said, while appealing to workers of all parties to stop indulging in acts of violence. \"BJP never believes in violence. It is what the communists had started in West Bengal and is now being practised by Trinamool there. I have told the DGP and other stakeholders to take steps for stopping the violence and asked them to take strong action immediately against all the accused,\" Deb added. Meanwhile, Tripura Congress demanded that the state government should pay due compensation to each victim of post-poll violence.

The Left Front has had an iron grip on the two Lok Sabha seats of the state since 1996. BJP, on the other hand, has never won a Lok Sabha seat in the state. This time, Times Now-VMR and India Today-Axis have both predicted a clean BJP sweep in Tripura. Last year, BJP had pushed Left into a state of near-oblivion in state politics - going from 0 to 36 in one shot in the election to the 60-member assembly. This time, after an election marked by repeated allegations of voter intimidation and manipulation by BJP, the results could be a re-run of the assembly poll verdict. CPM is biding its time, though. \"I have studied all exit poll predictions and final Lok Sabha election results since 2004. These figures are always skewed in favour of the ruling dispensation. This one is not any different. Every time, the difference has been about 60-70 seats in favour of the opposition,\" former CPM minister and senior party leader Pabitra Kar said, supplanting his argument by citing the disparity between the Australian pre-poll assessment that indicated a Labour victory and the actual Liberal party victory. \"Besides,\" he added, \"most groups are either managed by BJP leaders or funded by the party. We are confident Modi will not return at the Centre. BJP keeps saying 'Modi sarkar', not 'BJP sarkar'. It only shows how nervous they are about their lack of leadership.\" Congress, which has not won a Lok Sabha seat in the state since 1991, agreed with CPM. \"The exit poll did not reflect the true picture of people's mandate. There was a strong anti-Modi wave across the country. People have voted against BJP. But these exit polls seemed to be services provided to the ruling party, paid for. The exit poll has tried to gratify Team Modi shamelessly,\" spokesperson and vice-president of Congress's Tripura unit said. Congress, which drew a blank in the assembly election last year, has been consolidating its base again with a change of guard and fresh strategy. Going by the exit polls, the party does not seem to have covered much ground yet. BJP, meanwhile, placed its full faith in the exit polls, understandably. The war cry: \"Ab ki baar, teen sho paar.\" \"People voted for BJP blindly, considering the good work it has done for them over the past five years. We are confident BJP will emerge as the single largest party to form the government ... Other parties who are dreaming about forming a government have not even zeroed in on their prime ministerial candidate. We believe the people of the country are not fools and would not have voted for them,\" spokesperson of the party's Tripura unit, Nabendu Bhattacharjee, said.

Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination. His late grandfather, Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, was long associated with the Congress. | Full coverage of Lok Sabha elections in MaharashtraAmong other prominent leaders from Maharashtra in the first list of candidates are Union minister Nitin Gadkari from his hometown Nagpur, state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve from Jalna, Union MoS Hansraj Ahir from Chandrapur and Union MoS for defence Subash Bhamre from Dhule.

The last extremely severe cyclonic storm to develop and cross Odisha coast in May-June (pre-monsoon season) was the 1982 cyclone which crossed the coast between Paradip and Chandbali during midnight of June 3. IMD\u2019s summary report on Fani, shared with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), also mentioned about its effective alert dissemination mechanism which saw delivery of over 6 million SMS (short text messages) to the general public, disaster managers, farmers and fishermen in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal ahead of the landfall of Fani. The report showed that the country\u2019s national weather forecaster had, in fact, started tracking and predicting \u2018Fani\u2019 from April 18, 15 days ahead of its landfall. Its chart on \u2018landfall forecast errors\u2019 indicated how IMD reduced the margin of errors - both in predicting landfall point and landfall timing - in 2019 as compared to the long period average of 2014-18 period. Citing examples, the report noted that IMD\u2019s \u2018landfall time forecast error\u2019 for 24 hours\u2019 lead period for Fani reduced to 1.5 hours from 3 hours during 2014-18 period. Similarly, its \u2018landfall point forecast error\u2019 reduced to 11 km this year from 47 km during 2014-18 period, showing remarkable improvement after cyclone Phailin that hit Odisha in October, 2013. Its \u2018track forecast errors\u2019 and \u2018intensity forecast errors\u2019 have also been reduced substantially over the years. Referring to Fani\u2019s intensity which crossed the coast close to Puri with maximum wind speed of 175-185 kmph gusting to 205 kmph between 8-10 am on May 3, the report said it was the \u201cmost intense cyclone to cross Odisha coast after Phailin\u201d which had a maximum wind speed of 215 kmph. Fani had one of the longest track lengths of 3,030 km. In terms of intensity, Fani maintained the \u201ccyclonic storm intensity\u201d for almost 21 hours after landfall on May 3. About its monitoring, the report said, \u201cThe cyclone was monitored with the help of available satellite observations from INSAT 3D and 3DR, polar orbiting satellites, and available ships & buoy observations in the region.\u201d From May 1 onwards till May 4, the system was tracked gradually by IMD Doppler Weather Radars at Chennai, Machillipatnam, Visakhapatnam, Gopalpur, Paradeep, Kolkata and Agartala as it moved from south to north.

About 34 people have been detected with Plasmodium falciparum (PF) malaria in six villages of the area where ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers have been working. Chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb, who also holds the health portfolio, reviewed the situation on Monday and directed the health officials to undertake measures to arrest the situation and control further spread of the disease. Besides health workers, the Chief Minister also asked the local MLAs and other public representatives to supervise healthcare extension work. Spread of malaria and other vector-borne diseases in the hilly parts of Tripura has been a common phenomenon. While the situation had not escalated in the last few years due to precautions taken by the health department, two factors allegedly lie at the root of this outbreak. According to sources, more than normal amounts of pre-monsoon shower this year further aggravated the situation. Moreover, sources also point to a lapse by officials in the administration due to the general elections. A senior official of the health directorate assured that measures were being taken to control the effects of the outbreak,\"We have already arranged for a special medical team to conduct camps in the area. Health workers were directed to go for extensive rapid malaria check-ups in each and every household. Similar instructions were also issued to all other malaria-prone areas and alerts have been issued for doctors and medical staff working there.\" He added, \"Due to geographical proximity with the forests of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh, eastern-bordering stretches of Tripura are vulnerable to vector-borne diseases, including PF malaria.

The National Health Profile (NHP), 2018, released by the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI) last year, reported that Assam 225 deaths (highest in region) due to ARI in 2017, followed by Mizoram (36), Manipur (23) and Tripura 21 deaths. Nagaland recorded nine deaths, Sikkim (8), Meghalaya (7) and Arunchal Pradesh (3). In 2016, Assam recorded 200 deaths due to ARI, Mizoram (68), Sikkim (43), Manipur (21), Tripura (7) and Arunchal Pradesh (4). However, Nagaland didn't record any death due to ARI that year. The NHP, 2018, highlighted Meghalaya had the highest number of ARI cases (3,33,772) cases among eight states in the region in 2017. Tripura, with 1,78,570 ARI cases, is in the second position followed by Sikkim (93,270), Manipur (51,205), Arunachal Pradesh (36,250), Nagaland (31,158), Mizoram (29,595) and Assam (22,834). State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority ( SEIAA) chairman KG Bhattacharyya, who attended a World Environment Day programme organized by the Pollution Control Board, Assam, here on Wednesday, expressed concern over the increasing trend of particulate matter (PM10) (particles of size less than 10 micrometer) in five cities and towns of Assam. The places are Guwahati, Nalbari, Nagaon, Silchar & Sivasagar. Bhattacharyya said particulate matter (PM2.5) pollutants are more dangerous than PM10 level in the air. Former Meghalaya governor RS Mushahary said the government has to do a lot for fulfilling the 'Pollution Free Environment' agenda. He added that citizens have to be involved in achieving this goal. Biodiversity conservation organization Aaranyak said monitoring of air quality by the Assam Pollution Control Board at Bamunimaidan in Guwahati has revealed the presence of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) well above the prescribed limit since 2008. Aaranyak said Guwahati's air is found to have very high content of black carbon. \"There must be a paradigm change in our public transport system and related policy to bring down the rapid growth of vehicles out on the roads by introducing a mass transit system that will also help in climate change mitigation. Introduction of clean fuel and discouraging prevalence of dirty fuels as a policy strategy will go a long way in curbing vehicular air pollution,\" said an Aaranyak official.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

We have not experienced any achhe din as far as water-logging is concerned,\" said Ambari resident Nazneen Sultana.

The Met office said flood-threat was looming large over the state and parts of the northeast where the Southwest monsoon has made a significant advancement in the last 24 hours. The India Meteorological Department's (IMD) Regional Meteorological Centre has warned that heavy rain is likely to occur at isolated places over Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on Saturday. Ahead of the arrival of the monsoon season, Friday's rainfall was of convective nature, said weathermen. \"It was moderate rainfall measuring 13 mm on the rain gauge in Guwahati.

IPFT leaders, on the other hand, blamed BJP for the violence. Tripura lodged an FIR, stating that a group of IPFT workers stormed his house at Durgapur in Gandacherra between 11pm and midnight on Friday and tried to set it on fire. \"They also attempted to assault my family. I was away in Agartala, so I escaped,\" Tripura said, adding that the attackers did not say what had spurred this violent reaction. Rebati got in touch with the police here and the SP of Dhalai, who sent police forces to his home. The cops, however, took about 45 minutes to reach, by which time the criminals had left. \"Unfortunately, despite my repeated attempts to contact the SDPO of Gandacherra and other police officials stationed there, I could not reach them. Their mobiles were found to be switched off. I must say such dereliction of duty is not acceptable,\" Tripura said, adding that the matter was conveyed to the chief minister and other leaders of the party. According to reports, BJP supporters had taken out a victory rally in Gandacherra to celebrate Rabati's victory in the Lok Sabha elections. After a while, Rebati left for Agartala. The trouble began after he left the town. IPFT general secretary Mevar Kumar Jamatia, on the other hand, alleged that BJP workers from the victory rally had attacked the house of their party assistant general secretary and chairman of Ganganagar block, Jibanjoy Reang, and ransacked his house at night. However, Reang was able to escape. Later at night, the same group with two vehicles attacked the house of another leader, Prem Kumar Tripura, he added.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts.

Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.
