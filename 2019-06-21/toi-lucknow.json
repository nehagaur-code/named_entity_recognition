Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

The government has also decided to come up with a new policy in which every transformer would be metered. The decisions were taken at a high level meeting called by energy minister Shrikant Sharma. \u201cNow most villages have better link roads and therefore time limit for replacing damaged transformers should come down significantly,\u201d Sharma told TOI. \u201cTransformers are no more transported in bullock carts in rural areas.

The department also decided to convert all un-metered rural consumers into metered ones by the year-end. The un-metered consumers are mainly in rural areas and account for 19% of total electricity consumption. Sharma said that metering would ensure more revenue which would be used for better facilities.

An endangered species endemic to India, especially to the northern region, the number of gharials at the wildlife sanctuary have seen an over 50% rise in population. From mere 15 gharial nests in the river Girwa, wildlife conservationists at the sanctuary counted 32 nests this year. \u201cAs many as 852 hatchlings came out of eggshells in these 32 nests and went into the river. We managed to save 160 hatchlings, and will protect their life so that their population can be increased further,\u201d said Dudhwa Tiger reserve field director Ramesh Pandey. The Katarniaghat wildlife sanctuary falls under Dudhwa tiger reserve. \u201cIn 2005, there were just five gharial nests. After conservation, their count went up to 30-40 in next decade. But last year, the number went down to 15,\u201d he added. The conservationists then noticed that the sandbars used by the fish-eating narrow snout gharials were changing form significantly. This was because of over growth of tall grass, change in nature of sandbar\u2019s slopes when they got submerged in water and the presence of predators like dogs and vultures. \u201cWe systematically eliminated all of these factors, held vigils in teams and protected the eggs that the gharials hide in sandpits and the hatchlings from predators,\u201d said Pandey. Adding to the number of the species, conservationists have re-started the process of keeping back some hatchlings to help in population growth. \u201cThe 160 hatchlings we have kept with us, will be nurtured to attain strength and will be reintroduced into the river in winters so that chances of their survival improve and the survival rate is higher than when they are smaller and are in the river,\u201d said Pandey.

TimesViewFrequent incidents of chain and purse snatchings in the heart of the city mean there is no fear law among petty criminals . In such a scenario, CCTV cameras and quick response by police can act as deterrents. In case of arrest, evidence in the form of footage will help speed up investigation. Severe punishment should follow, especially for repeat offenders.A police dossier has listed 255 cases of chain and cash snatching in the city since January, which effectively means one person is being targeted every 15 hours. Worse, very few of the these cases have been cracked till date in the absence of effective electronic surveillance. Indiranagar and Gomtinagar top the list of unsafe neighbourhoods with a total of 49 cases followed by Aliganj with 11. The victims were mostly morning walkers, besides working women returning home late from office. In some cases, the accused used firearms to rob their victims of valuables. On May 29, two bikers tried to rob Urmila Devi of her gold chain at gunpoint in B Block, Indiranagar. She managed to retain half of the chain. Shikha Tiwari of Mahanagar recalled the horror of June 3 when two men flashed a pistol and snatched her gold chain in broad daylight. There were no patrol teams or CCTV cameras to nail them, Tiwari said. On June 8, Rekha Shah was robbed of her gold chain right in front of a police outpost in Talkatora. It was early morning. Her husband was teaching her how to ride a scooter. There were no policemen who could come to their rescue, she recalled. Not just women, snatch gangs have targeted men too in the recent past. On June 7, Ayush Jaiswal was robbed of his wallet by two men on a bike near Bhoothnath market. He says police have done precious little to identify the culprits, let alone arrest them. Sangeeta Agarwal of Mahanagar is still afraid to go out alone. On June 11, two men on a bike snatched her chain near Gole market when she was out to buy milk. \u201cI have stopped venturing out alone since that day. Police rarely patrol the city and CCTV cameras are absent. The city has become unsafe,\u201d she said. Ayushi Garg of Vibhuti Khand, who was robbed near Kathauta Crossing in May, said Lucknow police lack a dedicated mechanism to curb snatching. \u201cLast year, my friend was targeted at Husadiya Crossing while my aunt was robbed near Viram Khand crossing in 2017. Police are yet to crack those cases or take concrete measures to prevent rerun,\u201d she said. SSP Kalanidhi Naithani denied allegations that police were not doing enough to curb bike gangs that target unsuspecting victims and speed away. \u201cWe have identified vulnerable areas. These will now be geo-tagged to facilitate regular patrolling by the UP 100 fleet, besides district police,\u201d he said.

Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The trend has over the past four years gained momentum in Lucknow, where busy life often pushes the need to exercise to the back seat. The concept is win-win for both teacher and student, as the demand for home tutoring is helping instructors earn handsome remuneration every month. \u201cThe fee usually ranges from Rs 3,000 to Rs 10,000 a month, depending on the needs of an individual student.

She has been taking yoga classes at home for 15 years and says the ease of accessibility to these lessons has made all the difference. \u201cWhen you are a working mom, time is never a luxury. You hardly get the time to go out and train for personal well-being. Home yoga instructors help reduce your stress level because you have their undivided attention,\u201d she added. Agreed Mohit Singh, a yoga instructor in Mahanagar. \u201cAt any yoga institute, a typical class has 20-30 people. It is difficult to give special attention to each individual. Hence, home classes are better. Another trend that has emerged in recent years is DIY (do it yourself) yoga, where people watch and learn asanas from YouTube videos,\u201d said Singh.

This year, with monsoon already delayed, the rainfall deficiency between June 1 and June 18 is already being pegged from 26% to 84%. Ponds and wells have dried up and locals have to walk an hour to fetch water. The livestock is worst affected as carcasses are seen lining roads and lying scattered in fields. In the absence of jobs, failing agriculture and water shortage, most people have left for cities for temporary employment and will return to sow their fields when monsoon arrives. In Dhikwaha village of Mahoba district, 18-20 tubewells have gone dry. Princy Yadav (14) tells she has to walk an hour to the only tubewell outside the village to get water. \u201cAround 125 people from our village have gone to cities because there is neither water nor any work here. The women of the households go to fetch water in the morning, and in the evening, it\u2019s the turn of children after they return from school,\u201d she says. It takes 30 minutes to reach the tubewell, but well over two hours are actually spent in returning with water because there is a long queue at the tubewell. \u201cThere are frequent fights, as the tubewell often runs out of water and so all the people want to fill their vessels first,\u201d she said. In Dhoraiyan, residents say that 15 families left the village with the onset of summer and will return only after first monsoon rain. \u201cMonsoon had failed last year,\u201d says Pushpa, a resident. \u201cIt is delayed this time also because of which agriculture has been seriously affected. The fields are dry and there is no fodder for cattle. The wells and tubewells dried up months back. The government doesn\u2019t send any water tankers,\u201d she added. Mahoba recorded a rainfall deficit of 56% in 2018 where Banda was 8% rain deficient. This year, the pre-monsoon deficit is already 29% and 84%, respectively, with no rains yet to recharge wells and village ponds.

Pandey said that this is first such a project in the country where 100 \"gaushalas \"are being inaugurated in one day, constructed in just 90 days and will have maximum capacity to house 50,000 cows. While cattle was found starving for want of availability of fodder and also being abandoned by farmers after they are unproductive, Pandey and his team of officials from the veterinary department created the \"bhoosa bank\" (bank or storage of fodder) where farmers and people in rural areas could voluntarily donate fodder. Unnao chief veterinary officer has also created a whatsapp group of the 100 \"gaushalas\" spread over the 16 blocks of the district to ensure round-the-clock monitoring of the care and condition of the cattle housed there.

The Uttar Pradesh Private University Ordinance 2019 was passed by the state cabinet on Tuesday. Clarifying the government\u2019s stand on seeking an undertaking from private universities that they would not allow any anti-national activity on their campuses in accordance with the ordinance, state education minister Dinesh Sharma told TOI on Wednesday that universities are centres of learning and there should be no room for such activities. While the exact parameters of what constitutes anti-national activity have not been defined, Sharma said he referred to the 2016 \u2018tukde tukde\u2019 incident in JNU to state that \u201csuch activities\u201d would not be allowed. \u201cPrivate universities should be centres of educational excellence and we will promote them in that fashion. But anti-national and anti-social activities, which weaken unity and disrupt education, will not be tolerated. In some universities, anti-national slogans have been raised like \u2018Bharat tere tukde honge\u2019 and objectionable terms used to define the nation. In UP, we are here to teach and study, not to engage in any activity that seeks to divide,\u201d said Sharma. Adding that universities would be held liable if anything objectionable was said or done on their campuses, Sharma said that the new ordinance would act as a shield for universities. By making a university liable, he said, its administration would ensure that no anti-national activity was carried out on the campus as it would not want to be shut down. \u201cNow they can fix their agenda and let those speaking on campus know what cannot be said or discussed. The ordinance guarantees the right to speech but will not allow any anti-national activity. One is free to criticise leaders and the country but demanding its division is not permitted,\u201d added Sharma. Claiming that the ordinance ensured independence to universities while equipping the government to act like a chowkidaar, the education minister added that even in the distribution of honorary degrees, the government would not be recommending names but only clearing those proposed by the universities. Giving the example of former JNU president Kanhaiya Kumar, who has been charged for his involvement in the \u2018tukde tukde\u2019 incident, Sharma said that if the court was to clear his name in the case, the government would have no objection if he were to be given an honorary degree. \u201cWe have no objection to a university inviting Kumar to speak, but he cannot say the \u2018tukde tukde\u2019 kind of things there. The college cannot claim that it did not know what he or anyone would be saying,\u201d he said. While the ordinance has been passed by the cabinet and will be presented in the upcoming assembly session scheduled to commence from July 18, Sharma remained non-committal on when it would be implemented. The 27 private universities in the state will be given one year to change their Acts in accordance with Ordinance.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India.

Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

A hacker can use as many as 25 internet addresses to mask her identity,\" said a top intelligence official, closely monitoring the probe.  \"Instantly, after getting downloaded, the malware first prompts the user to key in a code. It's to ensure that the app is not a virus or malware. Immediately after that, it scans all latest attachments sent from the computer in emails or downloads. It then scans all files with photographs, databses of MS Word and MS Excel, by first verifying their encryption keys and then opening their passwords,\" said a senior intelligence official.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users.

He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said.

There are 3,048 undergraduate seats at LU of which 10% are reserved for EWS candidates. The admission process is almost over, but 77% of these reserved seats had no claimants till this report was filed on Wednesday.

Singh maintained that many candidates had more queries about funds and scholarships for underprivileged students than the EWS admission quota.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

About 10 years ago, the severe water scarcity made the residents of Jakhni village in Banda district make efforts to revive the ponds in the area. Their grit and efforts yielded results. This year, while several other villages are lying parched, five ponds in Jakhni village are full and residents are getting easy supply of water through tubewells. The full ponds in Jakhni now serve many purposes. With temperatures soaring to 48 degree Celsius this summer in the interiors of Bundelkhand, Jakhni remains relatively cool. Even in the afternoon, residents say, a cool breeze blows through the village because of the water bodies. \u201cThe ponds started drying up years ago. About 10 years back, even the largest one dried up. We then thought of trying to revive them. Initially, villages started digging under MNREGA. Subsequently, the gram sabha also helped and we managed to revive five ponds by desilting them and removing encroachments. At this point, when rest of Bundelkhand is dry, we have five full ponds,\u201d said Keshav Pandey, a resident. In neighbouring Mahoba, where the water crisis is more severe than Banda, the gram pradhan of Bara village got a pipeline laid from the only functional tubewell beyond the dwellings and ensured multiple filling points to ensure that villagers do not spend hours in trekking to the tubewell outside the village. The village had no internal water supply and was dependent on government tankers. \u201cThe tankers would not reach everyone and were not regular either. There was only one functional tubewell outside the village, so we decided to pool our own funds and got a pipeline laid from it to our village. At present, there are multiple filling points in the village and 2,000 litre tanks are kept at five spots, said gram pradhan Bhagwan Das. The village also took up tree plantation aggressively along with revival of ponds to ensure that groundwater level rises. \u201cWe realise the importance of the one tubewell which is supplying water to the entire village. We will not let it run dry. In fact, we are reviving other tubewells and ponds as well to ensure that the groundwater level rises,\u201d said Malti, a villager. \u201cWe ourselves constructed dykes along the fields so that all rain water flows into the field and gets collected. We are also digging and de-silting our ponds for their revival,\u201d she added.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

He said that no immediate action has been taken against the professors or the colleges considering the fact that at times a professor switches from one college to another then his/her name is not updated in the records. \"We will also find out if these professors were drawing salaries from both the colleges,\" the registrar said.  \"If colleges, professors or both would be found guilty then LU will be publicize their names on its official website and take strict action against them.\" In January last year, LU had directed all colleges to upload faculty detail on the University Data Resource Centre portal but various colleges uploaded the information only after being issued repeated warnings. LU officials said these two colleges, too, uploaded the faculty details after several warnings.
