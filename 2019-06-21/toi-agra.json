This time, notices have been issued to 16 advertisement agencies. They have been asked to remove unipole hoardings placed at unapproved spots. Besides, the notice mention that agencies will have to pay double charges for using both sides of the unipole for advertisement. Some agencies have been hoodwinking the AMC by getting permission for a single unipole and using both sides to put up advertisements. Earlier, councilors had raised the matter with the civic body administration. According to senior AMC councilor Ravi Mathur, \u201cThe installation of unipoles following the develop-operate- and-transfer (DOT) model is largely taking place in violation of standard norms. Private advertisement agencies are causing revenue loss to the AMC. But civic body officials continue to remain lenient towards them. Only notices are being issued as a formality.\u201d AMC chief engineer AK Singh said, \u201cNotices have been issued to advertisement agencies for violation of norms in placing unipole hoardings. In case, the wrongly placed hoardings are not removed within 15 days, then strict action will be taken against the agencies. It has surfaced that some of the agencies are using both sides of the unipole by depositing charges for one-side advertisement. Such agencies will be identified and double charges will be recovered from them.\u201d The AMC administration had in a bid to curb installation of illegal hoardings in the city had allowed agencies to set up unipoles at 600 points across 100 wards of the city. The unipoles were planned to be positioned on road sides. But in violation of norms, the agencies placed them on road dividers. According to provisions of AMC adverstiment policy, there must be at least 250 to 300 meters distance between two unipoles. But around 60% unipoles in the city have not been set up as per the standard distance between them. In this regard, complaints had been received by the district administration and the state government. Earlier in February, AMC had issued notice to 24 agencies to remove unipole hoardings installed in violation of norms within 15 days. But no advertisement agency took the trouble to do so. Instead, councilors complained that 12 new unauthorized unipoles were installed by private agencies listed with the civic body.

Unauthorised eateries, bus stands, road interchanges, not only interrupt high-speed traffic, but also increase road accidents. According to available data, 905 people lost their lives and 9,336 were injured in 5,751 road accidents on Yamuna Expressway. Sources of private concessionaire responsible for operating Yamuna Expressway said that over 150 written complaints and reminders were sent to local police stations in Mathura and Gautam Budh Nagar districts about mushrooming of roadside eateries along the Expressway. These eateries often damage and remove barbed wires and fences to gain access to commuters, particularly truck drivers, motorbike riders and even bus passengers. \u201cThe situation has become so grim that both state-run government buses and private buses make regular pit stops at these eateries. It seems the drivers have some sort of monetary commission arrangements with these eateries. Sadly, these eateries pose a great threat and many have lost lives after being hit by speeding vehicles near these places,\u201d said Major (retired) Manish Singh, in-charge coordinator of Yamuna Expressway. \u201cParking vehicles on the Expressway is prohibited unless there is a genuine case of breakdown.\u201d \u201cApart from eateries, several unauthorised bus stands have cropped up along the Expressway. This also contributes to rise in accidents,\u201d said the Expressway official. Another source claimed that owing to local political pressure to appease residents of rural areas, two interchanges were opened near Baijana (Mathura) and Jewar (Gautam Budh Nagar), where commuters now openly flout traffic norms and travel in wrong directions to save fuel and time. The source also added that trucks carrying cattle to slaughterhouses between Agra and Aligarh stretch pose high risk to commuters, as the drivers tend to overspeed in order to avoid right-wing groups and police teams who either extort money or assault them. The drivers of cattle trucks mainly operate during night hours and \u201chardly care if they hit anyone on the road in order to save their own lives\u201d.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "AMU VC urges protesting doctors to return to work; medical college admin declares strike illegal": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amu-vc-urges-protesting-doctors-to-return-to-workmedical-college-admin-declares-strike-illegal/articleshow/69864223.cms", "time": "2019-06-19 23:01:00", "description": "AGRA: A day after the Aligarh Muslim University\u2019s (AMU) Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College administration declared the Junior doctors\u2019 strike as \u201cillegal\u201d, varsity\u2019s vice chancellor, Tariq Mansoor, has appealed to the 500 protesting doctors to return to work.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

It started a brawl, with the accused Suresh Kumar and his sons abusing and thrashing the victim and his brother. According to victim Hemraj, he and his brother Vishnu, 22, had gone to a sweet shop in Retia market in the morning, where the latter bought a samosa for Rs 6 but could pay only Rs 5. Suresh, the shopkeeper, along with his sons, started abusing and even beating up Vishnu for not paying the remaining Re 1. \u201cVishnu called me and when I reached there, they (the shopkeeper and his sons) threw hot oil from a pan on me and my brother,\u201d said Hemraj. Hemraj, trying to shield his brother, received major burn injuries, while Vishnu escaped with minor burns. Police, however, said they are investigating whether the shopkeeper had intentionally poured hot oil on the victims or it accidentally fell on them. The shopkeeper, on the other hand, claimed that when he demanded money for the samosa from Vishnu, the latter and his brother vandalized his shop and also looted money. Station house officer (SHO) of Raya police station, Subhash Chandra Pandey, said a case had been registered against seven persons, including Suresh Kumar and his sons, Pramod and Ram Kumar, under sections 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC, based on a complaint filed by the victim.

He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users.

He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

Around 40-45 unidentified persons, including 20 women, who reached the police post in a tractor-trolley, pelted stones and damaged chairs, tables, a fan, and a motorcycle, which was parked there. A few police personnel, who were present at the time of the attack, fled the post to save themselves from the mob fury. Outraged residents of Kunjera village also shouted slogans against the police when cops claimed that the deceased could have been killed by some wild animal. On Tuesday, police registered a murder case on the basis of a complaint given by the deceased\u2019s family members. A case was registered against 40-45 unidentified people, who had attacked the police post.

A senior police official said, \u201cSanyal is so well-versed with various government offices, posts and senior officials\u2019 identities, that he threw names of officials and political leaders on hoteliers to show his connection with them. In fact, he often would claim to be a member of the National Tourism Advisory Council since 2014. Interestingly, the council was set up in 2016, which hardly any hotelier cross checked. Sanyal knew that often in Indian hotels, staff don\u2019t question senior government officials about their details.\u201d From Sanyal, police recovered scores of visiting cards of government officials and politicians, along with alleged fake letters written on government notepad, two annual reports of Indian Tourism Development Council and a book named, \u2018Positioning the battle for your mind\u2019, which deals in problems of communicating to a skeptical, media-blitzed public.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar.

The eight victims were on their way to Agra to visit Taj Mahal, when their hatchback allegedly rammed into the rear of a truck, registered with Karnataka\u2019s regional transport office (RTO). The victims belonged to Jewar of Gautam Buddh Nagar district and Khurja and Pahasu of Bulandshahr. In another road accident on Yamuna Expressway on Saturday at 12:53 am, a sedan rammed into iron railing and turned turtle. The accident occurred at milestone 156 of Khandauli police jurisdiction of Agra district. According to police, the accident - where eight members of a family were killed - occurred at 8:40 am near milestone 140 under Baldeo police jurisdiction of Mathura district. The victims were identified as Neeraj (25), wife of Prem Chand; Anita (30), wife of Shiv Kumar; Anjali (13), daughter of Shiv Kumar; Vishnu (25), son of Suresh; Karuna (22), daughter of Sulekh; Shalu (19), daughter of Jai Prakash; Santoshi (20) and Gabbar Singh (25), sons of Brahm Singh. Major (retired) Manoj Manish Singh, manager of Yamuna Expressway, Mathura section, told TOI, \u201cThe hatchback was probably cruising at a very high speed.\" He added, \"There was nothing left of the mangled car. Expressway rescue team which reached the location in six minutes, found six bodies along with two grievously injured trapped inside the car. We immediately rushed the victims to the nearest hospital.\u201d They died during treatment. Station house officer of Baldeo, Sunil Kumar Singh, said, \u201cThe car had rammed into the rear of a truck, which suggest either the car\u2019s driver fell asleep on steering wheel, or the truck driver applied sudden brakes in the middle of the road. After the accident, the truck driver fled in his vehicle. The truck\u2019s number plate was found at the accident site, which was registered with Karnataka RTO.\u201d \u201cBodies of all the eight victims have been sent for autopsy and a written complaint has been taken from their relative to lodge an FIR,\u201d he added. Prem Chand, husband of deceased Neeraj, said, \u201cAround 16 members of our distant family were travelling to Agra to visit Taj Mahal in two cars via Yamuna Expressway. We all had left for Agra from Khurja on Saturday night and had a brief stay at my in-law\u2019s home in Naujheel of Mathura district. We resumed our journey on Sunday morning. I was driving my van and ferrying all male members of the family, including my two children. When the accident took place, we were 10-12 km away from the hatchback and had no idea about the tragedy.\u201d \u201cAll eight members of my family, including my wife, niece and friend, were killed,\u201d said Prem Chand, who runs a small store of electrical items in Jewar. In the other road accident, the car\u2019s four occupants hailed from Delhi and were on their way to Bihar to attend a wedding, the police said. One of the victims, identified as Pawan Bhambhani (35), succumbed while being treated at a hospital. His three friends - Lalit Thapa, Arun Bhewal and Manto - suffered injuries. According to expressway rescue team, the sedan was also struck by another speeding car. A source from Yamuna expressway claimed that occupants of the sedan were in an inebriated state and were speeding when the accident took place. Rohit Bhambhani, deceased victim's brother said, \"Pawan was not inebriated when accident occurred. The autopsy report has confirmed it.\" A total of 4,956 accidents, 718 deaths and 7,671 serious injuries were recorded on the Yamuna Expressway between August 2012 and March 31, 2018, an RTI reply had revealed. In this period, a total of 2.33 crore vehicles violated speed limits, data provided by automatic surveillance gadgets and number plate readers installed at various points showed. However, only 17,883 were issued challans by traffic police in four UP districts of Agra, Aligarh, Mathura and Gautam Budh Nagar. Data available from the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) revealed that 23.42% accidents were caused due to speeding while 12% were due to tyre bursts.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Stretching from Alipur-Barwara close to Aligarh-Kasganj district border to Bagrai of Kasganj-Farrukhabad border, the distributary is 118 km long and is said to be the main river Ganga which gradually shifted to the northern part. According to the district administration, Buddhi Ganga passes through 60 gram panchayats of Kasganj district and if reinstated, the distributary will provide irrigation facility to 7,500 hectare farm land owned by local residents.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

According to data accessed by TOI, between January 1 and June 17, 2019, the expressway reported 244 road accidents in which 96 people were killed and 608 injured.

In 2018, the expressway recorded 659 road accidents in which nearly 110 people were killed and 1,315 left injured. Major (Retd) Manish Singh, the in charge coordinator of Yamuna Expressway, told TOI: \u201cThe first six months' casualties figures are worrisome, particularly the sudden surge in June. Our study of accident pattern suggests that majority of accidents have happened due to drivers dozing off on steering wheel, over-speeding, negligent and rash driving.\u201d \u201cAccidents caused by dozing off on steering wheel was more prominent in day hours. We witness cases where truck, buses and even motorcycles were crossing 100-kmph limit. This year, there were more casualties of motorcycle riders. We often found riders cruising at over 100 kmph in the right lane while they should be riding at around 60 kmph on the left lane. There were also cases where we found passenger buses been driven by inexperienced \u2018cleaner\u2019 instead of licensed driver.\" According to private concessionaire sources, majority of accidents took place in Mathura district, followed by Gautam Budh Nagar and Agra. \u201cNearly 22,000 over-speeding bills were issued in recent months and handed over to local police, but we don\u2019t know whether those defaulters were penalised or not,\u201d said a source. \u201cIf people continued to die at this rate on the expressway, 2019 could well register new dubious record.
