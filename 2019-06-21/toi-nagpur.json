Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Even as the logistics sector has grown by 77% in 2018, Nagpur is yet to find a place in India\u2019s warehousing map, it says. The report also says that Nagpur\u2019s emergence as a warehousing hub remains uncertain, due to its lack of proximity to any major consumption centre. The report was released on Wednesday. Nagpur was chosen for the study considering the hype and also the recent developments in terms of infrastructure carried out here. Knight Frank\u2019s report, which studied a number of major areas like Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Hyderabad and NCR, only puts Nagpur among the second rung centres in terms of warehousing business. \u201cDespite its strategic location, the major consumption markets such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai are 800 to 1,000km away from Nagpur. The tier II and tier III cities near Nagpur like Raipur, Jabalpur, Bhopal, Bhilai and Indore are far below in the pecking order from a consumption perspective. While it is still premature to write off Nagpur, its warehousing clusters are not getting organized as fast as other cities, post implementation of GST,\u201d says the report. Pinkesh Teckwani, national director (industrial & asset services) for Knight Frank India, told TOI, \u201cNagpur may have a strategic advantage in terms of location but having a central warehouse under the hub and scope model here does not make a feasible business proposition for many. Logistics still constitutes almost 13% to 15% of the cost component. Given the distances from major consumption centres, bringing a warehousing set-up in Nagpur would not make a major difference in terms of cost reduction.\u201d Centres like NCR or even Mumbai would be too far to be fed from Nagpur. NCR and Mumbai constitute almost 40% of the consumption, he said. Nagpur can, however, have regional hubs catering to locations within a distance of 300km, he said. It can also emerge as an air cargo hub but surface transport can\u2019t be as feasible. However, a chunk of transportation remains to take place through road. The reduction in transportation may not even be compensated by lesser rentals, he said. Meanwhile, the Knight Frank report also mentions that the Mihan project is expected to attract sizeable investments for both SEZ and non-SEZ areas, due to which Nagpur can emerge as a major cargo hub. The manufacturing industry units will include those from sectors like food processing, pharmaceuticals and textiles The large-scale industrial activity is likely to give a fillip to quality warehousing business. The industrial estates of MIDC too have a major role to play in the development. Shivkumar Rao, vice-president of Vidarbha Economic Development Council (VED), said it was always proposed that Nagpur has the prospect of emerging as a regional hub. However, even that has to be facilitated by putting in place the right regulatory framework. The state had come up with a logistics policy in 2018 which remains to be implemented completely, he said. VED had been championing for Mihan since the idea was conceived. Atul Pande, president of Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA), maintained optimism about Nagpur, said that it is the apparent choice for a logistics hub. Every part of the country is almost equidistant from Nagpur and the city is well-connected by road, rail and air, he added.

NMC has received a kit for the 2020 Swachh Bharat Survekshan, which has three broad parameters; infrastructure availability, maintenance of road premises and equipment, and feedback from commuters for rating roads on overall cleanliness, under the Swachh Bharat Survey. Bad roads or potholed roads would cost NMC 163 marks. In 2019, Nagpur city stood 58th in the Swachh survey. This means NMC will not only have to make the roads free of potholes but also keep them well maintained through the monsoon. Even open water drainage system will account for four marks. Lack of zebra crossings or stop lines will cost the civic body another four marks. Non-functioning or poor maintenance of traffic signals will also cost four marks. Encroachment on footpaths and lack of traffic signs weighs for eight marks. In recent years, NMC earned a dubious distinction for bad roads and poor maintenance of traffic signals. Civic activist and secretary of Vidarbha Taxpayers Association (VTA) Tejinder Singh Renu admitted that Nagpur will face an extreme challenge due to new parameters of Swachh infrastructure. \u201cAs a majority of roads in Nagpur are under construction, our current roads condition, water drainage, street markings and cleanliness is certainly not up to the mark. Therefore, maintaining our position will be a big challenge for city administration,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cI believe such change of parameters by ministry of urban development is deliberate so that all city administrations concentrate on road conditions, which need to be good with the monsoon around the corner. Bad roads in the rainy season makes road usage extremely dangerous, especially for two-wheeler users,\u201d he added. Our city administration needs to be strict about contractors, including those of MSRDC, NHAI and NIT, as roads are not repaired even after other work is completed. The service roads are in a pathetic condition, which makes riding absolutely miserable during monsoon. \u201cIf roads are not made motorable soon, I fear a drastic drop in city\u2019s rating in next Swachh Bharat rankings,\u201d he said. Another challenge for NMC this year will be to remain on its toes through the year, as from this year Swachh Bharat assessment would be undertaken on a quarterly basis. This move comes after many cities slipped, and were not able to maintain hygiene once they got a decent ranking on cleanliness levels in the previous Swachh surveys, and NMC was no exception. The quarterly rank of cities will play a crucial role in their annual ranking in Swachh Survekshan 2020 because of the 25% weight given to the quarterly assessment, said the official. The annual assessment will be conducted between January and February 2020, he said.

Hande and Mhaisekar were arrested by Warora police of Chandrapur district after seizing two cartons of liquor in their car. The car was driven by Mhaisekar. Hande, who was in uniform despite being a holiday, had tried to mislead the cops. Warora police was also granted two days of custody remand by the court for detailed investigation. It\u2019s learnt that the car was in the name of Mhaisekar\u2019s mother who is a medical practitioner too. City police top brass, after receiving the official reports from their Chandrapur counterparts, decided to invoke the powers granted to competent authority under article 311 (2) (B) of the Indian constitution to remove Hande from service for maligning the image of the department. The city police also cited the nexus of Hande with criminals and racketeers as the other reason for his dismissal. Another ground, proposed to dismiss Hande, was that he may influence, threaten and intimidate the witnesses if any inquiry is instituted against him.

Drought has left the 700 trees of his orchard sapped beyond revival. He has no choice but to mow them down. The trees would have bore fruit for another 15 years had there been enough water, he says. The well in his farm has touched rock bottom and the water that trickles is only enough to keep the new plantation alive, which would take another four years to bear fruit. In his decades of experience in the orange belt of Katol taluka, 60km from Nagpur, Kharade says times were never so tough. Scores of trees of the famed Nagpur orange and sweet lime (mosambi) also grown side by side, have withered away due to lack of water. The trees bear fruits during summer and have to be irrigated till its rains to get a sizeable harvest in September-October. Two years of deficient rains have left water resources depleted. Water wasn\u2019t released for irrigation from the nearby Jam project, say locals. With even farm wells exhausted, for those like Kharade the only option is to cut down the trees. He plans to grow cotton on the land and plant orange or mosambi saplings only a year later. The orchard earned him around Rs2 lakh a year. \u201cI can manage because my sons work and farming is not the sole means of livelihood,\u201d he says. Clearing the orchards has cost him Rs50,000 and the wood that has no other use except fuel may fetch Rs4,000, says Kharade. \u201cOthers are not so lucky. A majority of the growers depend solely on agriculture. Farmers are managing to get water even by deploying tankers to keep the trees alive. However, about half of the orange trees in the area have died. The situation is worse in other pockets like Warud in Amravati,\u201d says Manoj Jawanjal, a director in Maha Orange, an orange growers\u2019 association. There is a likelihood of a major dip in area under orange this year. The government should promptly undertake a survey and assess the damage. A demand has been already put up at the collectorate, he says. Across the road, workers toil 65 feet below in a well. A worker Premalal climbs up the pulley. \u201cWe have been digging since a week, and may have to go further 9 feet deep to strike water. Our team has deepened 4-5 wells during this season only to get water at 70 to 75 feet depth,\u201d he says. Even the JCB operator is a busy man with orders to raze orchards in villages around. Riding a rickety bicycle, Shankar Gawande looks desperate. Over a quarter of his orange trees have gone. With little funds, he does not plan to even cut the trees this year. \u201cIt\u2019s a loss of almost Rs1.25 lakh. I have three sons, none earns enough,\u201d he says. A tanker costs Rs1,000 for each round. Tankers are needed in a gap of 2-3 days. Farmers like Arun Raut have gone for tankers. \u201cSo far, I have gone for 10 rounds of watering using tankers. Hopefully, that would save the 200-odd trees I have,\u201d he says. Patches of green orchards seen intermittently are either due to availability of ground water or tough efforts.

A group of leaders led by former MLA Ashish Deshmukh had met district collector Ashwin Mudgal more than a fortnight back and appraised him about the dwindling water scenario in orange orchards. In their representation, they had demanded 90% subsidy on drip irrigation, supply of water through tankers in highly dried areas for irrigation and advising state agriculture farmers to guide in mulching. \u201cThe collector had assured us to forward our demands to the chief minister. Unlike western Maharashtra, Vidarbha\u2019s horticulture farmers have got no compensation for drought in areas like Kalmeshwar, Katol and Narkhed,\u201d said Deshmukh. The state agriculture department has also not conducted any survey yet to assess the extent of the orchard drying. R Bhonsale, joint director agriculture, Nagpur division, told TOI that the survey can be done only on directions of the district collector. \u201cWe have no such instructions yet,\u201d he said. New state agriculture minister Anil Bonde said that he took meetings of agriculture secretaries and directors, and told them to generate their own data on affected areas without depending on the revenue department. \u201cAgriculture department officials should remain connected with farmers and always have an estimate of any losses about all crops,\u201d he said. Though most farmers are claiming that their orchards incurred permanent damage, MS Ladaniya, the director Central Citrus Research Institute (CCRI), has denied it. \u201cIt is temporary drying. Even if a few green leaves are present on a tree, it can be revived through rain. But this is possible only in the areas where there is heavy and deep soil in orange growing areas in Morshi, Warud and Katol tehsils. Oranges in shallow and light soils will not survive such drought,\u201d he said. Ladaniya claims that CCRI had issued advisories to orange growers to thin the fruits (remove half fruits) from trees to reduce the loss on a tree. The institute had also suggested mulching (covering of the tree bottom by grass, straw or even plastic) to prevent evaporation losses. This helps conserve water near the roots. \u201cThe state government needs to take the issue seriously. Farmers should be advised to retain moisture in soil and spend more money on it. Last monsoon had a 23% deficit. If this persists, this year too the situation will be grave. There should be a water grid for proper distribution. It is an expensive proposition but is one of the solutions,\u201d said Ladaniya.

The building will be one of the tallest in the city after completion. Earlier, the private operator was to construct the project on its own and pay royalty to the Metro agency. However, during the pre-bid meeting, construction companies said that it would be difficult for them to obtain all clearances from agencies like Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). MahaMetro therefore decided to construct the structure itself using the operator\u2019s money. \u201cWe will obtain all the permissions needed for construction. The operator will pay us money in instalments. It will also do the interiors. It will start paying us royalty when it starts leasing out the property. The exact revenue model is however, being worked out,\u201d said Brijesh Dixit, managing director of MahaMetro. Admitting that the slump in real estate market had hit the project, he said that the construction model may be changed if it does not get proper response. The project will come up on Patwardhan Ground, which is spread over an area of around 20,000 square metre. The TTMC will be connected with Sitabuldi Metro station with an elevated skywalk. Metro will provide bus connectivity and parking in the TTMC. The construction will have a floor to space index (FSI) of 4 and will be spread over 9.83 lakh square feet. Some 2.92 lakh square feet will be dedicated to free parking. One TTMC tower will be 25 storey high while the remaining two will have 19 floors. All the towers will have retail mall on ground, first and second floors and small offices on third, fourth and fifth floors. A three-level multiplex has been envisaged above fifth floor in Tower 1 and fifteen floor of offices in Towers 1 and 3. Retail mall would have online stores, food court, family entertainment centre, large format stores, supermarket, mini anchor fashion store, mini anchor for electronics and home decor, etc. The basement will be completely dedicated to parking. There will be 600 bays for parking of cars, 1,050 bays for parking of motorcycles and 1,000 slots for bicycles. L&T leased trains on CM\u2019s request While activist Prashant Pawar had alleged that MahaMetro leased two trains from L & T, which runs the Hyderabad Metro, because it is a private company, documents obtained by TOI show otherwise. L & T was extremely reluctant to provide the two trains (six coaches) sought by MahaMetro. It was only after Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis wrote a letter to his Telangana counterpart in May 2017 that L & T changed its decision. MahaMetro was forced to lease L & T trains because they are similar to the Nagpur Metro ones. Both have three coaches and front evacuation facility. Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) had asked MahaMetro to conduct trial run only with trains that are similar to the ones to be used by Nagpur Metro. L & T took advantage of this fact and charged a whopping Rs7.5 crore annual rent per train. It imposed a condition that the lease period should be four years. MahaMetro managed to reduce it to three.

On a tip-off from a citizen about tree felling in Gokulpeth, Kosurakar from NGO Green Vigil Foundation reached the spot where a group of labourers were chopping branches of a fully-grown Subabul tree.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

This is the first such sighting of a partial albino bird in Vidarbha,\u201d said ornithologist and founder of Central India Bird Academy (CIBA), Dr Anil Pimplapure. The bird was sighted by Dr Pimplapure, along with Kaustubh Pandharipande, Aniruddha Bhagat in Gorewada lake on Monday morning. The bird watchers stumbled upon the bird when they had gone to see the plight of the drying Gorewada lake. Dr Pimplapure recalled such a sighting was reported at Bhigwan near Pune previously and this case is extremely rare. This stage occurs due to lack of pigmentation named melanin in the birds due to which the feathers of the bird turn white. \u201cMelanin gives strength to feathers and protects damage to eyes due to the ultra violet rays of the sun,\u201d he added. Dr Pimplapure further said that the lake's water level has reached the lowest since last 100 years. The sighting of this bird has delighted the city birders.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The decision came following submission of an adjournment motion in the NMC general body meeting over water crisis by senior Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe and BJP corporator Dharmpal Meshram. The general body meeting on Thursday began after a delay of 70 minutes and witnessed noisy scenes. Independents and BSP corporators staged a walkout over mayor Nanda Jichkar\u2019s refusal to allow discussions on the issues raised by them. A war of words also erupted between the ruling and opposition members over not allowing corporators to seek information over the issues raised by them. The city had witnessed low rainfall last year. With a view to streamline water supply across the city this summer, the general body had instructed the administration to prepare an action taken report regarding the measures it would take to ensure proper supply during summer. During the period, Gudadhe had alleged unequal distribution of water in the city. \u201cMany areas were getting around the clock water, while numerous localities were deprived of even a bucket of potable water,\u201d Gudadhe had claimed. However, even after six months of being instructed to table ATR, the administration had no report to table before the House despite the opposition parties repeatedly raising the issue and reminding the ruling party in the last general body meetings held in January and February. Gudadhe also alleged that the NMC supplied almost 740mld per day before the Lok Sabha elections, which has now come down significantly. The administration failed to give a satisfactory reply to Gudadhe\u2019s query. WWD executive engineer Shweta Banerjee admitted that now the NMC is supplying 670mld to 680mld daily. Independent corporator Abha Pande tore up the agenda of NMC general body to protest mayor Nanda Jichkar\u2019s decision not to allow discussion on water scarcity in the city that was on the agenda raised by her. She charged Jichkar with dictatorial attitude in conducting the House. Pande will now stage \u2018Jal Tyag Andolan\u2019 along with her supporters at 11.30am on Friday. Congress corporator Harish Gwalbanshi raised water works department\u2019s lackadaisical approach to de-silt Gorewada lake. He also alleged that though the NMC hired two excavators for de-silting the lake, the work was yet to start. The civic body should take the advantage of dry bed of the lake as it would help the NMC to ensure better water storage in the coming years, he pointed out. BSP corporator Jitendra Ghodeswar raised the issue of many localities in North Nagpur were receiving contaminated tap water. Senior Congress corporator Manoj Sangole suggested the NMC should use well water for fire tenders and de-choking machines. Leader of opposition Tanaji Wanve sought the mayor to direct the administration to lodge police complaints against Orange City Water for ignoring leakages in pipelines and failing to resolve water contamination issues. The general body directed the civic administration to check whether the civic body has power to take action against RO plants selling water in cans after Wanve raised the issue of illegal operation of the plants in the city. According to him, there are over 100s RO plants, while zones of the civic body had issued only 21 no-objection certificates. Most of the RO plants were selling contaminated water, he claimed.

(Shruti Sancheti is fashion designer and fashion faculty) Expert view Abdul Zubair Fashion is forward looking and cyclical Fashion designing is the art of applying design, aesthetics and natural beauty to clothing and its accessories. This art is influenced by cultural and social attitudes and has evolved over time and place. Fashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as aesthetically pleasing. They consider who is likely to wear the garment as well as the occasions. They work within a wide range of material, colours, patterns and styles. The scope of fashion designing is wide in both India and abroad. Students have innumerable choices in front of them after completing their professional studies in fashion designing. Fashion designers have varied options including designing, research, cloth production, textile designing, fashion merchandises, fashion stylists, fashion photography, entrepreneur etc. Fashion has always been a hotbed for innovation, from invention of sewing machine to rise of e-commerce. Like technology, fashion is forward looking and cyclical. Today, technology is transforming fashion at a faster pace than ever. From robots that sew and cut fabrics to AI algorithms that predict style trends to VR mirrors in dressing rooms, technology is automating, personalizing and speeding up every aspect of fashion. The fashion market in India is currently estimated at USD 70 billion. Though a handful of designers existed prior to 1980s, the late 80s and 90s saw a spurt. This was the result of increasing exposure to global fashion and economic boom after economic liberalization in 1991. It is the most glamorous field. It does not require creative thinking, but a lucrative and growth-oriented mind. Fashion designing is one of the fields that creates high-paying jobs in India for deserving creative artists.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

After the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court rejected their plea, students from the city have once again knocked the Supreme Court\u2019s doors for justice. On June 13, the HC bench consisting of justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak rejected the petition filed by Dr Sagar Sarda, Dr Sameer Deshmukh and other PG aspirants challenging Maharashtra government\u2019s ordinance for 16% seats under SEBC quota for Maratha students. The Maharashtra State Reservation (of seats for admission in educational institutions in the State and for appointments in the public services and posts under the State) for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 2019, was promulgated to supersede HC\u2019s and SC\u2019s verdicts that had quashed the SEBC quota for PG medical seats in state. Senior counsels Shekhar Naphade and Meenakshi Arora, assisted by Hrishikesh Chitale and Ashwin Deshpande pleaded for the petitioners. They contended that the HC refused to hear their plea due to SC\u2019s orders or June 4 where it had prohibited all courts from hearing any case related to this vexed issue. They pointed out that SEBC Act, which was actually implemented from November 30, was also under challenge in HC\u2019s principal bench in Mumbai. The SC judges clarified that it can\u2019t just leave the petitioners \u201cremedy-less\u201d as either HC or SC had to adjudicate the issue. They pointed out that SC itself had directed the petitioners to approach the Nagpur bench for relief. In their plea, the PG aspirants pointed out that HC had refused to entertain their contentions citing top court\u2019s orders of June 4 and 10. They argued that the SEBC ordinance was contrary to the law set by the SC and prayed for its quashing. According to them, the ordinance is clearly an attempt to nullify the HC\u2019s May 2 judgement that was later upheld by the SC. It\u2019s also an effort to circumvent the apex court\u2019s directives that amounts to interfering with its order. They were been prejudiced by the ordinance of illegally applying reservation and thus depriving them of benefit of the HC and SC orders. The ordinance is thus contrary to the law laid down by SC and deserves to be set aside. Both Sarda and Deshmukh had filed first petition in the Nagpur bench where they had challenged 16% SEBC quota in the PG medical seats, which was quashed by the bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Pushpa Ganediwala on May 2. While clarifying that the SEBC quota would be made applicable from the next academic year only, the HC had declared provisional PG seats matrix of March 27 that had a provision for SEBC candidates as \u201cillegal\u201d.

NU used to offer Bachelor of Mass Communication (BMC) and MMC degrees then. After TOI report that nomenclatures of both degrees were not as per the UGC norms and both degrees were illegal, NU constituted a panel under the then head of department at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University in Aurangabad, Sudhir Gawhane, to tackle the crisis. The then administration under ex-VC SN Pathan and GS Parasher changed them to \u2018Bachelor of Journalist (BJ)\u2019 and \u2018MA in Mass Communication\u2019 in 2009 to fit them as per norms.NU Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director (officiating) Anil Hirekhan confirmed that NU had decided to recall those \u201cwrong degrees\u201d and award new ones. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that only 59 students were awarded those degrees with wrong nomenclature at NU\u2019s Department of Mass Communication and Dhanwate National College (DNC). Of them, about 20-25 were taken by the students from their respective colleges while others are with their offices. We\u2019ve directed colleges to convey students and ask them to return their degrees.\u201dHirekhan said NU would award them revised degrees probably in a week.

The petitioners \u2014 Devansh Malviya and 12 others \u2014 through counsels Bhanudas Kulkarni and Rohan Malviya, questioned central government\u2019s (COA\u2019s) powers to thrust its recommendations through May 29, 2017 and Feb 12, 2019, notifications. Though they cleared National Aptitude Test in Architecture (NATA) which was mandatory for admissions to architecture courses, they were declared ineligible to join, as they failed to secure 50% marks individually in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics (PCM) group as per new norms framed by COA, which is an apex body like AICTE. According to them, the newly prescribed norms are beyond the COA\u2019s powers and hence, arbitrary and untenable. They argued that their admissions are valid according the previously enforced criteria back of 2016, which must be followed as of now. They prayed for scrapping the new norms and ensuring their admissions, as their future is at stake. Kulkarni contended that COA council never accepted the newly prescribed norms including 50% each in PCM and aggregate as well. Opposing his contentions, Nahush Khubalkar, pleading on CET Cell\u2019s behalf, informed that COA under Section 21 of Architects Act has powers to decide the eligibility criteria for admissions, which was vested by the Architects Act. In 2014, the COA made NATA or JEE (Joint Entrance Exam) mandatory for the eligibility. Later in its 64th meeting on August 27, 2015, it fixed the eligibility for admissions to BArch courses where it fixed 10+2 with PCM and 50% marks in aggregate for securing a seat. The new criteria was implemented from the academic session 2017-18. The apex body had clarified that no candidate shall be eligible for the architecture course unless he/she has passed 10+2 or equivalent with aggregate 50% marks and individually as well in PCM. In 2016, COA issued a letter to the State Department of Higher and Technical Education that there should be an amendment in the minimum criteria for the students to take admissions in BArch course.

Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Even as the demand for reservation will not be withdrawn earmarking of such an amount will certainly leave the community enthused. \u201cThe grudge that Dhangars have not been granted ST status will certainly not come in the way of the good news that as much as Rs1,000 crore has been sanctioned. This has set a precedent as never before a substantial amount was specifically sanctioned for the benefit of a single community,\u201d Mahatme told TOI. Before the state elections, BJP had promised Dhangars, a community of shepherds who are now classified as nomadic tribes (NT), reservation as STs. The promise has remained unfulfilled. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said that the government will send its recommendations to the centre on the basis of a report on Dhangars\u2019 socio-economic status prepared by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). Even as TISS has submitted its report in November 2018, it has not been tabled in the state assembly. However, Mahatme said not getting ST status may not affect Dhangars votes for the BJP. Dhangar leaders in NCP and Congress have called the allocation a mere eyewash. They said they would be taking up the issue with their respective party high commands demanding that a mass agitation should be launched. Mahatme\u2019s own popularity had waned after he accepted the Rajya Sabha seat from BJP and the agitation lost steam. Mahatme said, \u201cReservation is affirmative action intended for the benefit of a certain class. Finally, if benefit is the aim, it can also come through measures announced in the budget.\u201d he said. On the reservation issue, he said, \u201cThe BJP has at least declared a package but no other party is talking about reservation.\u201d The Rs1,000 crore include facilities like scholarships and assistance for buying land. Ram Hari Roopkunwar, a Dhangar leader from Congress in Sholapur, said, \u201cBJP has only exploited the community for votes.\u201d He said will he put up a proposal in a forthcoming meeting of various community leaders and a mass agitation will be launched. Ramrao Wadkute of NCP in Hingoli said that the Dhangars have been left disillusioned. \u201cIt is just an allocation. The final implementation will take its own time. I will be taking up the issue with the party leadership and woo the community to launch a struggle. The Dhangar leaders are ready with all the resources,\u201d he said.

Shridhar Solo, from Warud and an ex-ZP member, said that the government was sitting over a proposal of Lakhara Laghu Sinchan Yojna (irrigation project). \u201cOver 30 lakh trees have died. Irrigation secretary (Eknath Dhwale) should be held responsible for this,\u201d he said.

Wandu Wasankar, from village Khadsi in Achalpur tehsil in Amravati district, owns a 20-acre orchard with 3,000 orange trees. He told TOI that orchards had dried up in Akot, Chandur Bazar and Anjangaon tehsils too. \u201cThe Sapan dam which is nearby is ready and holds water.

The huge saving of water in Pench reservoirs will not be possible as the water resources department (WRD) is all set to miss the deadline for completing Kochchhi barrage on Kanhan river by December-end. The NMC standing committee on Tuesday approved the water works department\u2019s proposal to appoint WAPCOS Limited, a central government company, to prepare Detailed Project Report (DPR) and also execute the project to use running water of Kanhan river instead of water from Pench reservoirs for six months, from June to December. The civic body will pay WAPCOS Rs21.99 crore for the project. NMC uses water from Pench reservoirs to supply drinking water to 70% areas of the city throughout the year. Requirement of remaining water is met from running water of Kanhan river. During summer, Kanhan river has to be fed from Pench reservoirs. Huge quantum of water goes waste from Kanhan river between June and December due to lack of a reservoir on it. Therefore, NMC planned to lay a pipeline from Kanhan river and use this running water instead of water from Pench reservoirs in these six months. The plan approved on Tuesday will take at least one year for WAPCOS Limited to prepare DPR and complete the project. The plan was prepared in June last year but was delayed due to reasons known only to NMC officials. Due to shortage of water in Pench reservoirs, WRD could not supply water for irrigation during both, kharip and rabbi, seasons. NMC is drawing water from dead stock of Pench reservoirs for last one month. The Pench reservoirs are likely to get less water this year too due to construction of Chaurai dam by Madhya Pradesh upstream of Pench river. Therefore, the delay in mitigation measures is likely to increase the water crisis next year. Ruling party leader Sandip Joshi admitted the inordinate delay from the water works department in completing the process. \u201cWe have decided to award the work to WAPCOS Limited without going for tendering process due to the delay. The project would have been delayed further in case of tendering,\u201d he said. Standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane said he would check about the delay and take appropriate action. In another setback, WRD officials confirmed water cannot be stored in Kochchhi barrage this monsoon. \u201cSome 80% of the works are completed. Project require another Rs300 crore for completion. We will be able to store water only in the next monsoon,\u201d they said. The barrage costing Rs947 crore is the first on Kanhan river. Around 75 million meter cube (MMC) water could have been stored in the barrage if it had been completed in time. The project was delayed due to shortage of funds.

The minutes of the REC meeting were released recently.The South East Central Railway (SECR), Nagpur, is executing the Rs800 crore project to construct new 52.86km broad gauge line between Wadsa-Gadchiroli ostensibly to transport iron ore and minerals from Gadchiroli and Chhattisgarh in the future. The project is being implemented on PPP basis and Maharashtra government has agreed to share 50% cost.Though the REC has given in-principle approval to the project, there are hiccups over taking mitigation measures. Of the 83 hectares dense forest, some 4km passes through tiger-bearing areas. Chopne said the REC decided working permission will be granted only after funds for taking up mitigation measures as suggested by the committee of WII and NTCA are deposited by the user agency.Among the other recommended mitigation steps include maximum speed of trains while approaching and passing through forest area shall be 40 kmph during night and 50 kmph during day time. \u201cWe have also asked the SECR to remove two stations from forest patches which will bring down the proposed forest diversion area,\u201d he said.However, talking to TOI, senior SECR officials said the REC itself has desired that a study will be carried out by a joint team of WII and NTCA to suggest mitigation measures. The suggestion of WII-NTCA will be binding on SECR. The forest department is coordinating the joint inspection schedule.\u201cWe are ready to take mitigation measures and increase the span of bridges. We are also not averse to 500 metre underpasses in forested patches but many odd conditions are being put forward. If REC or WII-NTCA is not satisfied by our mitigation steps and proposes to go for elevated viaduct on piers it will lead to cost escalation making the project infeasible,\u201d SECR officials said.Based on REC suggestion, a one-man NTCA team consisting of Hemant Kamdi from regional office here had already conducted a site visit on January 22, 2019 and observed that mitigation measures should be taken as per the WII guidelines on \u2018Eco-friendly measures to mitigate impacts of linear infrastructure on wildlife\u2019 approved by the MoEFCC.According to forest sources, the NTCA team suggested transplantation of trees instead of felling, underpasses for reptile species, besides 5% of the project cost to mitigate negative impact of the project and forming monitoring committee to oversee whether mitigation steps are as per WII green infrastructure guidelines.As per WII\u2019s eco-friendly mitigation guideline document the user agencies need to follow hierarchy of mitigation steps where avoidance is the best option. It also suggests considering not only engineering aspects like underpasses but speed and traffic control and integrate options of light and sound barriers, camouflaging and landscaping.Wadsa deputy conservator (DyCF) Niranjan Vivrekar said, \u201cWe have sought undertakings from the railways on mitigation steps and other set of conditions. Once we receive it the proposal will be forwarded to PCCF office.\u201dWII GUIDELINES SAY ...* Follow hierarchy of mitigation measures given in the guidelines where avoidance is best option* Consider not only engineering option like underpasses but regulatory mechanism like speed and traffic control* Follow design, dimension for large carnivore and herbivore and as per the available corridor patch size.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The application was filed in PIL (No 67/2015) by Sable through counsel Shreerang Bhandarkar praying for directives to the PWD for construction of additional infrastructure like courts and bar rooms for convenience of lawyers and litigants. Firdos Mirza appeared for high court, while Uday Dable pleaded for District Bar Association (DBA). Earlier, the judges added ThyssenKrupp Elevators, which was having annual maintenance contract (AMC) for the lifts in entire District and Sessions\u2019 Court complex, as a respondent in the case, following its failure to do servicing of lifts that led to last week\u2019s accident. In its affidavit, the PWD executive engineer (electrical division) Manish Patil informed that generator set for providing backup for lifts was purchased way back in 1968 and has now become outdated. The work order to purchase a 500 KVADG set of generator is given to the agency to assist 100% power backup. He sought 40 days to replace it with new one. However, the judges turned down his request, asking him to complete the formalities within 20 days. Patil also referred to some of the points raised by PDJ Vibha Ingle in her affidavit to the court where she had pointed out non-compliance of 16 electrical works by the PWD. He informed that most of the works were completed in this regard. In last hearing, the bench had directed respondents to ensure sufficient measures for fire safety in the building, to avoid any eventuality. To this, the PWD informed that for fire safety measures, an estimate was technically sanctioned by the department and its tender was floated on June 11. Its tender bid would open on July 5. The administrative approval for installing new fire fighting system was received on June 12. Patil came out with startling revelation that the work on providing firefighting system could be completed within 40 days and later permission from the Nagpur municipal Corporation (NMC) could be obtained. It means, there is no firefighting system in the premises which is thronged by over 20,000 visitors every day, thus putting their lives at a big risk in case of emergency, according to lawyers.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

He was enraged over the beef ban imposed by the Maharashtra government and attacked police constables Amol Badukale, Yogesh Dongarwar and Sudarshan Aghav with a knife, injuring them outside the mosque on Bakri Eid. After he was arrested, the case was handed over to Mumbai-based Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS). The ATS claimed Razaqque had come into contact with Khan on Facebook and introduced him to Malik. Both Khan and Malik then instigated Razaqque to join \u2018jihadi movement\u2019 and also lured him to go to Afghanistan for training. ATS pointed out that Razaqque was highly influenced by the speeches of Maulana Masood Azar, the founder of banned terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammad, which was behind the deadly attacks on the Parliament and the recent one at Pulwama, where 40 CRPF personnel were martyred. He even used to listen to inflammatory speeches of preacher Zakir Naik and Al Qaida founder Osama bin Laden. He also ran a WhatsApp group named \u2018Friends Forever\u2019, where inflammatory material was circulated. When Razaqque\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts were checked, it was found that he was following jihadi groups. After arrest of all three, incriminating material such as CDs and Urdu material was seized. They were charged under various sections of IPC, Arms Act, and Bombay Police Act, besides UAPA. The charge sheet was filed with JMFC court in Nagpur, which remanded the case to Akola court. \u201cIt appears that Malik has exhibited his anger through violence against government and some Hindu organizations for ban on cow slaughtering. No doubt, he used the word \u2018jihad\u2019. But it was adventurous to jump to the conclusion that only for using word \u2018jihad\u2019 he should be branded as terrorist,\u201d the judge said. The court, however, maintained Malik\u2019s conviction under all IPC sections and sentenced him to three years behind bars. Since he was been in jail from September 25, 2015, he was released as he had already served his full term. The court asked Khan and Malik to furnish a surety of Rs15,000 each while acquitting them of all the charges. Speaking to TOI, Malik\u2019s father said they were happy as justice was finally done. \u201cI want to thank SP MLA Abu Azmi along with Afzal Farooki, Mayatai Chaure, Pervez Siddiqui from Nagpur for helping us in these tough times, where we lost everything. I am happy that my son had rejoined the Mohamadiya Masjid as a cleric. His son was just one-and-a-half-years-old when he was forcibly taken by the police.\u201d He added that after his son\u2019s arrest, they lost everything and suffered immense social stigma. \u201cI suffered losses in my business.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

The Std XI online centralized admission process (CAP) will start from Wednesday with students getting access to the crucial part-2 form on the web portal.Many parents felt that Std XI seats in good colleges will be grabbed by CBSE students, where internal marks still continue, and this in turn led to pressure being built up on the education department. With the state elections just a few months away, the government too probably did not want to be seen as not doing enough for their \u2018own\u2019 and was exploring various options before finally settling down for a seat increase.Junior colleges in Nagpur and Pune get 10% increase across all streams, whereas in Mumbai it varies depending on the stream. About 21 colleges in Nagpur have been selected for the seat increment and this increased capacity will be visible to students on the admission portal. Other colleges that want to increase their intake capacity will have to follow the established protocol of applying with the deputy director of education (DDE) office. As per the initial reports, this increase in seats is only for this academic session because of the \u2018extraordinary situation\u2019, which means next year college\u2019s pool for Std XI will revert to original number.Schools, however, feel that the solution offered by the government does not solve the original problem.

However, Rajendra Patle is still in the fray. Virendra Jaiswal, who resigned from BJP before nominations, is not being considered rebel as he contests every time. BJP\u2019s Sunil Mendhe is pitted against Nana Panchbudhe of NCP here. Bopche\u2019s rebellion had created panic in the BJP camp as he is popular in the Pawar community and in general among OBCs. In Nagpur, Abdul Karim Patel and Ravikant Meshram, withdrew on Thursday, taking the total number to three. Pallavi Nandeshwar had withdrawn on Wednesday. In Ramtek, Sachin Shende, Gajanan Jambhulkar, Prakash Tembhurne, Ranjit Saphelkar and Lalit Shamkuwar have opted out of the race. In Yavatmal-Washim and Wardha, seven and two candidates respectively withdrew on the final day. One independent candidate withdrew his nomination in Gadchiroli-Chimur constituency on Thursday.

Based on recommendation of a state committee, state\u2019s principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Nitin H Kakodkar has issued orders to release the tigress. Talking to TOI, Kakodkar confirmed the sub-adult tigress will be released in MTR. The radio-collared problem tigress E1 was captured on May 31 from forest area in Mendki-Naleshwar in North Brahmapuri range after it killed two villagers. According to forest officials, E1 prowled in agriculture fields and posed threat to humans. However, proposal to capture the tigress was hurriedly pushed after villagers from Parsodi, Tukum, Ganeshpur, Rampuri, Ekara staged a sit-in dharna inside the office of deputy conservator of forest (DCF) Kulraj Singh in Brahmapuri demanding immediate measures against tiger terror. The tigress is currently kept in Gorewada Rescue Centre and is expected to be shifted to Melghat soon. The PCCF\u2019s decision follows a committee consisting of a wildlife veterinarian, Satpuda Foundation chief Kishor Rithe, honorary wildlife warden Kundan Hate and retired DFO GK Vashishta and others giving the go ahead for the release. The committee has suggested release of the tigress as early as possible in an administratively suitable area after fitting a radio collar. Sources said the members also discussed threadbare problems in the aftermath of release of such tigers, especially the failed experiment of Brahmapuri tigress T27-C1 named as \u2018Kismat\u2019. The tigress was released in Bor Tiger Reserve on July 29, 2017. It was electrocuted on October 14, 2017, after covering 500km. A section of committee members justified release of captured tigress stating that every year Brahmapuri records birth of 10 new cubs. The speed with which tigers are being captured here, even rescue centres will get flooded soon. \u201cWe took a decision on a scientific basis. This tigress is a dispersing female and was engaged in conflict while in search of new territory,\u201d said one of the members. Even National Tiger Conservation Authority\u2019s (NTCA) standard operating procedure (SOP) states that if a tranquillized tiger is found to be healthy, in prime or young age, and without any incapacitation (loss of canine, injury, broken paw etc), then it may be released after radio collaring in a suitable habitat with adequate prey base, away from the territory of a resident male tiger (if any), or human settlements. Even Wildlife Institute of India (WII) tiger expert Bilal Habib justified the decision on release. \u201cIt is very easy to keep a tiger in captivity. The tigress had entered into conflict by chance and it is scientific to re-release the tigress as it will provide more insights to conservation and corridors,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cEven as it is difficult to say how the tigress will behave after release, Melghat, spread in over 2,700sqkm, has good potential. It already has 50 tigers and still there is ample scope to accommodate more tigers,\u201d said wildlife and environment lawyer from Akot Manish Jeswani. \u201cSeveral villages have been relocated from Melghat apparently to create inviolate spaces for tigers. Besides, the buffer area has also been brought under the control of Melghat giving an edge,\u201d added Jeswani.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "RCB team 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rcb-team-2019-players-list-royal-challengers-bangalore-team-2019/articleshow/67151637.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Activist alleges Metro favoured L&T, agency denies claim": {"datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/activist-alleges-metro-favoured-lt-agency-denies-claim/articleshow/69865600.cms", "time": "2019-06-20 09:54:00", "description": "Nagpur: Jai Jawan Jai Kisan leader Prashant Pawar on Wednesday alleged that MahaMetro had favoured L & T, which runs Hyderabad Metro, in leasing coaches. MahaMetro however, trashed his claim citing directives of Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS). Citing a preliminary audit report, Pawar said that MahaMetro had leased six coaches from L & T for Rs15 crore a year. \u201cMoreover, the coaches were leased for four years when they were required only for one year,\u201d he added. MahaMetro managing director Brijesh Dixit said that the coaches have been leased for three years and not four. \u201cAfter using them in Nagpur, we will take them to Pune and later may be Thane if state government awards the project to us. It takes weeks for new coaches to be tested and so the ones leased were vital for the trial run and inspections of Research Design and Standards Organization (RDSO) and Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS),\u201d he added. \u201cWe had earlier contacted Chennai Metro, a government owned one, for two trains. However, they are four coach trains and our platforms are not that long. Secondly, they have side evacuation facility against front evacuation of our coaches. CMRS asked us to lease only those trains that are similar to ours,\u201d he further said. The cost of a Nagpur Metro train is around Rs30 crore, including taxes. However, L & T has charged Rs7.5 crore per train per year. On this, he said, \u201cEven Chennai Metro had asked for Rs7.10 crore per train. The rent is on the higher side but it's a suppliers\u2019 market. We didn\u2019t contact other Metros after CMRS directive,\u201d said Dixit. Pawar also alleged that there was a delay in delivery of coaches from China. Dixit countered it saying Nagpur Metro was the fastest in ordering the rolling stock. \u201cThere was a delay of about four months in finalizing the contract as one of the bidders had approached High Court and then Supreme Court,\u201d he said. The MD further said that cost of rolling stock as per the detailed project report (DPR) was Rs922 crore while Nagpur Metro had awarded the tender for Rs718 crore thus leading to a saving of Rs204 crore. Jai Jawan Jai Kisan had earlier alleged that the contractor for Reach III had been awarded the contract for building some stations of Reach II without any tender. Dixit said that the DPR nowhere mentioned that construction work had to be awarded to different contractors. \u201cOur contract for Reach III clearly states that work site means the places where the permanent works are to be executed and any other places as may be specified in the contract as forming part of the site. Our site in the entire city of Nagpur,\u201d he added. Pawar also slammed MahaMetro for holding joyrides saying that there was no provision for it in the DPR. Dixit said that they were held on the request of citizens, who had endured a lot of inconvenience during construction work. \u201cThe coaches from L & T were leased for trial run and not joyrides,\u201d he added. CMRS inspects Nagpur MetroA team of Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) led by commissioner Janak Kumar Garg took stock of various works being done by Nagpur Metro in Reach I (Sitabuldi to Khapri). KL Purthi and Varun Maurya were other members of the team. CMRS is here to sanction the second line of Reach I. Garg first met MahaMetro managing director Brijesh Dixit to learn about the progress of Reach I. He then held meetings with senior officials, including Mahesh Kumar, Sunil Mathur, S Sivamathan, Anil Kokate and others. The commissioner then visited Sitabuldi interchange station. He inspected the security system and various facilities available at the station. They included smoke detection system, emergency lighting, fire safety equipment, scanner, automatic fare collection gates, escalators, etc CMRS team will travel by trolley from Sitabuldi to Khapri and inspect Airport and Khapri stations on the way.

They also claimed NMC is directing them to shut down operations under pressure from former mayor and corporator Pravin Datke. Refuting the allegations, Datke said he had objected to opening the centres illegally, that too in school premises, and allowing staffers of private garbage operator Kanak Resources Management Limited (KRML) to sell NMC\u2019s garbage to the women SHGs illegally. Anasuya Kale-Chhabrani and Shefali Dudhbade of Swachh Association and the women SHGs have demanded that NMC should regularize the centres and allow them to continue. \u201cThere is a provision in Swachh Bharat Mission to open MRF. We were running our centre at Dhantoli. NMC officials requested us to run the centre in association with them, to get points under Swachh Bharat Mission. Then, NMC Women and Child Welfare Department invited applications from women SHGs to develop and run MRFs in each of the ten zones. Six MRF were opened in October last year. Problems started after Datke\u2019s complaint,\u201d they said. They added, \u201cNMC officials never gave any official letters to open and run MRF.

Datke also said NMC officials do not have powers to allow Kanak staffers to sell waste collected door-to-door to MRF. \u201cIt is a policy decision and permission of general body was mandatory. No permission was taken to lease out spaces for MRF,\u201d he said.

Indamer Aviation which has been allotted land next to the Air India\u2019s MRO, has completed 70% of construction work with four hangars ready. It plans to start operations by December end this year. Indamer Aviation in which two Indian businessmen Prayaj Patel and Sunil Gupta have a stake has tied up with US aircraft maintenance services provider AAR. The MRO, spread in 30 acres of land in the SEZ, will be taking up framework maintenance of Airbus 320 aircraft. This means the outer body, interiors and work except major overhaul of the engines will be done here. Rajesh Gupta, the CEO of Indamer said his company hopes to get the FAA and EASA approvals from the American and European aviation authorities in the coming months. If secured in the expected time, Indamer Aviation\u2019s set up in Mihan can be the first framework MRO to be operational in India. \u201cThis would be a win-win situation for the company, airlines and also the government as it would save a substantial foreign exchange outgo,\u201d he said. \u201cAirlines like Indigo and Go Air have already expressed their willingness to offer business to Indamer Aviation after the operations begin. This means the MRO hopes to have sizeable business in the initial stages itself,\u201d he added. Indamer Aviation is also the oldest MRO in the country. It began in 1939 with a single hangar near the Juhu Airport. The company was then promoted by American entrepreneur Joseph Koszarek. In 2007, the company became part of European Aviation holding Company Private Limited (EAHC). Finally Patel and Gupta invested in the business. With the Nagpur venture, Indamer will be taking up works for the civil aviation aircraft for the first time. This means, so far it was taking up the servicing of private jets, and at Nagpur it would be catering to even aircraft deployed by various airlines, explained Gupta. Meanwhile in what may give another boost to the Mihan-SEZ, the Concor\u2019s Inland Container Depot (ICD), is expected to start within a month\u2019s time. All that needs to be done is that the ICD needs to be connected with the station by the railways. Concor is a subsidiary of Indian Railways that is engaged in transport of cargo containers to the seaports. Concor\u2019s chief general manager for Central India Arunkumar Satpathy said the agency is in a position to start the facility in a month\u2019s time if the rail connectivity is established. Under the present situation, trains running from the direction of Nagpur to Mumbai can reach the ICD but not those form the opposite direction. \u201cThere has been a time overrun as the work was expected to have been completed by 2016. However, now the railways have assured to finish it within a month\u2019s time after which the ICD here can become operational,\u201d said Sathpathy, adding, \u201cOnce ready, majority of the work from the present ICD at Narendra Nagar will be shifted to Mihan.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Bollywood couples who went public with their love affair in 2018": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/bollywood-couples-who-went-public-with-their-love-affair-in-2018/photostory/67300070.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Urmila Matondkar": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/news/congress-fields-urmila-matondkar-from-mumbai-north-ls-seat/articleshow/68626271.cms", "time": "", "description": "MUMBAI: The Congress on Friday nominated actress Urmila Matondkar and former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar from Mumbai North and Bihar's Sasaram parliamentary constituencies respectively.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The Congress leader hit out at BJP's strategy of playing the nationalist card. \"We are Congress\u2026 we launched the freedom movement\u2026 gave our blood and sweat\u2026 braved British atrocities \u2026 we don't need any certificate to prove our nationalist feelings especially from the ones who apologised to the British at that time\", asserted Priyanka, urging the workers to go to every household in their area and meet every voter. She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022. And once we come, we will stay here for long on the basis of our hard work,\" she said adding that the hard-workers would be adequately rewarded.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

Those chairmen who were retained their position included Jitendra Kukde (transport committee), Sandip Jadhav (property tax committee), Dilip Diwe (education committee), Dharmpal Meshram (legal committee) and Vijay Zalke (water committee). Diwe and Kukde have been retained for a third term, while Zalke, Meshram and Jadhav were given a second term. First-time corporator and former standing committee chairman Virendra Kukreja has been appointed as health committee chairman. Congress corporators, requesting anonymity, claimed that infighting has led to shortlisting two members in all the 11 committees. Congress corporators alleged that since Tanaji Wanve was appointed as leader of opposition in the NMC, the party failed to raise public issues in the general body meetings. However, Wanve and senior Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe said that they will nominate corporators in these committees in next general body meeting. Wanve claimed that the party did not submit the nominations to lodge protest after the mayor Nanda Jichkar did not allow discussion on the adjournment motion tabled by Gudadhe. BSP corporators, however, submitted a letter to the mayor and sought time as their party had suspended their party leader Mohammed Jamal. The party had sacked Jamal for not campaigning seriously in the Lok Sabha elections and the party leader in the NMC had reached a secret understanding with Congress candidate Nana Patole during the campaigning phase. Senior BSP corporator Jitendra Ghodeswar told media persons that the party will soon announce name of new party leader in the civic body.

An RTI reply disclosed that vacancies remain in both, undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG), courses. In 2017, there were 106 vacant seats and last year the number was 94. Students from entire country aspire to get admission into this prestigious institution, which was recently ranked 31st all-India by the National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF). Among NITs, VNIT is ranked at sixth position, and also attracts top-notch companies during its placements drives every year. However, rising vacancies is certainly a cause of concern, said RTI activist Abhay Kolarkar, who filed the queries with VNIT. Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) Rajendra Yerpude attributed the trend to students migrating to other NITs and universities. \u201cBeing a government-run institute, we try our best to fill up all seats, till the last round. But many a times, we don\u2019t get eligible candidates from Joint Entrance Examination (JEE). Due to all these factors, all seats can\u2019t be filled up.\u201d Yerpude, who himself filed the reply to Kolarkar\u2019s queries, informed that the institute was progressing well and they had managed to place most of their students in reputed companies like JP Morgan, C-DOT and others. In the last academic year, the highest salary offered was Rs23.86 lakh per annum while average package was Rs7.5 lakh per year. However, in comparison to 2016-17, even placements numbers have dropped by nearly 100. In 2016-17, 490 were placed, which decreased to 401 in 2017-18, and 393 till April 26 this year. \u201cMany of our students prefer to go for higher studies abroad while some of them apply for jobs themselves, which aren\u2019t reflected in our records. Sometimes, even companies do not recruit if they don\u2019t find suitable candidates. However, most top performing students get decent placements while a few underperformers may not get through. We manage to place over 70% students every year,\u201d Yerpude, who is also the faculty in-charge, told TOI. On a positive side though, the premier institution has increased seats for its various branches due to 10% EWS quota introduced by the BJP-led NDA government. On faculty position, though, VNIT is facing problems, with as many as 110 teachers\u2019 posts vacant and 13 non-teaching ones. Additionally, there are large scale vacancies in Group B and C staff, with 116 or 286 posts vacant. \u201cNew recruitment drive would be conducted in July-August, and some of these posts would be filled up,\u201d Yerpude said.
