Developer DLF has written to the department of town and country planning (DTCP), deputy commissioner and MCG, alleging that several plot owners in DLF-4 had carried out illegal constructions. The developer also claimed plot owners are constructing buildings with more than five floors, violating the rules. As per the norms, owners cannot construct buildings with more than four floors on an individual plot. Till now, DLF has submitted a list of around 850 such plots in different phases of DLF and the DTCP had sealed nearly three dozen houses on Golf Course Road recently. The plot owners, it has been alleged, build additional floors after getting occupation certificates from DTCP. In some cases, the buildings constructed for residential purposes are used for commercial activities in violation of the rules. \u201cWe would like to bring to your notice that some plot owners are illegally constructing their houses beyond sanctioned plan,\u201d said DLF in its letter to the authorities. \u201cSuch illegal constructions put additional burden on the existing infrastructure like sewerage, drainage, road and power supply of the colonies causing inconvenience to other residents,\u201d said a resident of DLF-4, adding that in some of these cases people have turned homes into commercial units, causing nuisance in the area. In most cases, these buildings are used for setting up guesthouses and in some other cases, they have leased out buildings to app-based accommodation facilities. Senior town planner (STP) Sudhir Chouhan said DTCP is issuing notices regularly and sealing drives have been conducted, but plot owners go to court and manage to get stay. \u201cIt obstructs our drive. Still the department is pursuing it. Courts are ordering stay even without giving us chance to put forth our views,\u201d said Chouhan. He also said the DTCP is empowered to take action under Urban Area Act 1975 in the municipal limit. However, courts grant stay in contravention of the Act\u2019s Section 3B. Chouhan said he had been in the court personally to take up the issue. The department, he said, is now planning to approach the apex court on this matter. As per the Section 3B of Haryana Development And Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975, no person is allowed to carry out constructions violating the approved plan. If they carry out construction in violation of approved plan, they will face action from the department.

Metro CCTV footage, with the help of which the woman identified him, is also with investigators now.

The arguments raised by the trio during their hearing in the second case, which pertains to cheating and forgery, were \u201csubject to investigation\u201d. Without commenting on the nature of the case, the court of Ved Prakash Verma, ADJ (fast-track court), said sufficient grounds for bail were not there. The lawyer of Ishika Singh, owner of BR Media Services Private Limited, contended that Bharat Hydel Projects Private Limited (owner of TV channel Network 10, also known as Nation Live) had a content-sharing agreement with her firm, signed on February 14 this year. K K Singh, the lawyer, argued that his client had been framed, that her firm had a valid content-sharing agreement with owners of Network 10, as well as a \u201ctime slot\u201d for running content on the channel, whose logo was retained. K K Singh told TOI they will now move Allahabad high court for bail. Advocate Nitin Gupta, representing the other arrested Nation Live staffers, editor Anuj Shukla and achor Anshul Kaushik, contended they were \u201cmere employees of the channel\u201d, who had joined a few months ago and had nothing to do with the channel\u2019s ownership pattern. Gupta told TOI, \u201cAnuj joined the channel only two months ago and had not prepared or signed any document related to the channel. For any work done by the channel, its owners/directors are responsible. Both Anuj and Anshul were merely employees.\u201d He too said they will now move the high court for bail. The court said \u201cit was unclear as to which administrative official had granted authority to BR Media to work for Network 10 on rent\u201d. The court order on Anuj\u2019s bail plea reads: \u201cInvestigation is on in the issue. The case diary also mentions fraud with some channel employees and issuance of cheques, which bounced due to lack of funds. So far, the memorandum of association and memorandum of article have not been included in the investigation.\u201d On Tuesday, the court of additional district and sessions judge V Nalin Kant Tyagi had ordered that the bail pleas of the trio in the defamation case be accepted and they be granted bail after submission of two sureties of Rs. 40,000 each. Noting that the sections 153 and 505 (1), 505 (2) are scrutinable by a magistrate and sections 153 and 501 are bailable offences, the court had said that the discussion does not seem to cause enmity, hatred and disaffection in the society. The arguments in the second FIR were heard on Wednesday in the court of ADJ (fast track court) Ved Prakash Verma and a copy of the order was issued late Wednesday night.

The Ambala police have booked the accused, Chetan Sabharwal of Sector 20D, Chandigarh, under Sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \"Sabharwal had organized a camp at my son's school and selected him for a trip to the US. For this, he had demanded Rs 2.3 lakh and his passport. I initially gave him Rs 30,000 as file charges and for the visa.

The stigma attached to conditions such as depression or anxiety is all too real in India, leaving sufferers despairing of a way out of the darkness. This is where support networks come in, with the offer of a patient and empathetic ear, and (just maybe) the promise of future emotional well-being. Finally, it seems, there\u2019s a window for those who struggle to see the light. Sakshi Virmani reports Hawkers and peddlers swarm the Georgian colonnades of Connaught Place on a busy Sunday evening. Inside Central Park, a group of 15 youngsters huddle together on the dew-drenched grass, unmindful of ardent lovebirds playing peekaboo around them. The session gets underway with an activity in which members are asked to identify a nearby object, something they can relate to. A bespectacled boy picks a bench, someone else chooses a defunct traffic light. At this Offcause meet-up, each of the 15 is being keenly observed by a psychologist, who is helming the hour-long group therapy. Here, you can speak freely about your fears, anxieties and traumas, and, also, share tips on how to get by. The idea is to get everyone talking, to make sure nobody feels left out, by providing a sheltered space and an environment that\u2019s non-judgemental, accommodative and creative. Offcause, for example, lends a hand by encouraging men and women to talk candidly, or to take part in activity-based therapy (painting, dance, improv comedy). More than a few come to listen, some seek succour in the shape of suggestions, yet others draw strength from fellow participants who have emerged from the shadows. \u201cAcknowledging the stigma is the first step, and getting yourself out of the house is another \u2013 we self-stigmatise ourselves so much,\u201d claims UK-based Jhilmil Breckenridge, a poet, mental-health activist and founder of Bhor Foundation, an initiative devoted to mental health. Indeed, for the thousands whose days seem perpetually gloomy, an hour or so in the right company might help part the clouds to reveal a ray of sunshine.  LISTENING WITHOUT PREJUDICE Initiatives like Offcause offer a support web for the many overwhelmed by mental health concerns, without the patient having to shell out on a therapist (thus, avoiding the unease of a visit to the psychiatrist). Such collectives comprise individuals whose experiences leave them best suited to help others similarly afflicted. \u201cAfter I got out of depression, I realised it really helps to talk to somebody who is going through similar issues, as it gives them hope,\u201d admits Mridul Trehan, who credits counseling received by the Delhi Depression Support Group for his recovery. Ujala, a 29-year-old from Jammu, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and clinical depression. A regular at Offcause meet-ups, Ujala feels that sharing her experiences can be of immense value to fellow sufferers trying to understand the difference between surface and underlying issues. \u201cPersonally, I am seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist for my PTSD and depression, but I love being a part of Offcause \u2014 to help others going through various mental disorders,\u201d she says. \u201cYou cannot categorise mental illness due to some accident or trigger, it depends on genetics and the way some people\u2019s brains are wired. Some incidents have a ripple effect, they keep playing again and again, which is emotionally consuming,\u201d explains Ujala, who doesn\u2019t just recall incidents, she relives them (like the domestic violence she and her mother have been victims of). For Offcause founder Nikita, it was a causal Instagram update on World Mental Health Day last October that proved the spark. \u201cI asked if people had any stories to share anonymously for the Instagram page I wanted to launch, (and) the response was great \u2013 it was surprising to see my closest friends talking about issues they would have never discussed with me on the rare occasions we would meet,\u201d reveals Nikita, who, having left her job just three months earlier, was somewhat at her wit\u2019s end. So, a page was created and the conversations continued. In less than a month, Offcause had its first informal group therapy session. Since then, it has been hosting meet-ups on the third Saturday of every month in Delhi, Gurgaon and Mumbai.  STRIKING THE RIGHT NOTE At an upmarket gastropub in South Delhi, a group of musicians are sharing a laugh over pints of draught beer. They form part of support group Good Vibration, initially launched to discuss problems affecting young musicians, and anybody associated with the industry. Now, anyone can join in, in the monthly meets. Founder Rithika Nayan, a music teacher and certified life coach, commences by talking about anxiety. Soon, the discussion touches on panic attacks, and how best to deal with them. \u201cScream!\u201d suggests one. \u201cTake a nap!\u201d recommends another, a quick-fix that has everyone nodding in unison. \u201cWe millennials are looking for external validation all the time. Blowing things out of proportion in our heads, overthinking and suppressing emotions leads to extreme outbursts. We are never taught how to deal with our emotions intelligently,\u201d explains Rithika to an audience of 12, all absorbed. \u201cKeeping a gratitude journal really helps \u2014 counting the small blessings makes a difference,\u201d she offers. According to a 2015-16 survey by Bangalore-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), 13.7% of India\u2019s general population suffers from a mental ailment. While 150 million Indians are in urgent need of mental health intervention, only 30 million have access to such care. And, according to WHO (World Health Organisation) projections, by 2020 approximately 20% of Indians would be beset by some form of mental illness. Yet, to many in India, mental health still comes with plenty of baggage, and potential loss of face in front of peers. The older generation is reluctant to talk about it and the young think it\u2019s a fad, believes psychologist Dr Ritu Dangwal. She advocates an organised support network. \u201cSupport groups are essentially reassurance and reinforcements, more like stopgap arrangements. The groups need to realise that if a person needs extra help, they must guide them to psychiatrists,\u201d she insists. \u201cIn India, poor people don\u2019t have the bandwidth to access even basic medical care. But it is heartening to know at least the younger generation is reaching out and saying it\u2019s okay to talk about it.\u201d Dr Dangwal does, however, advise caution. \u201cThe tricky part is when everyone starts giving advice. It\u2019s encouraging to have support groups but only to a point \u2014 they can address problems at the surface.\u201d  CARE FOR THE CAREGIVERS On a Saturday afternoon last month, a support group of caregivers assembled to discuss family and relationships at Khoj Studios, in the bylanes of Delhi\u2019s Khirki Extension. The Listening Circles provide solace and support not just for those undergoing mental distress, but also for their caregivers, who could be a spouse, parents or children. This support network is moderated by Namarita Kathait, a commissioning editor with a publishing house, and Jhilmil Breckenridge. \u201cWe wanted to start a support group that is non-hierarchal, and to get people together in a safe space to have a discourse on mental health,\u201d tells Namarita, 25, who inadvertently became a caregiver for her mother when she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. \u201cI was labelled as the sad girl in school because I did not know how to express what I was going through,\u201d she says, speaking for the many who choose to remain silent. For Jhilmil, it\u2019s important that guidance or advice is not pushed against anyone\u2019s wishes. \u201cPeople are already vulnerable, we don\u2019t want to force things like meditation and spirituality on them,\u201d she stresses. The next step, says Namarita, is to build \u2018listening circles\u2019 with those who have attended the sessions, and to create support groups in their own localities, in colleges and hostels, and among the wider community. \u201cOur ethos is very clear \u2013 we are here to listen and we keep it as liberal as possible,\u201d she maintains. \u201cPeople have the right to speak and not speak, to walk in at any point they want.\u201d  YOU\u2019RE NOT ALONE Then there are youngsters striving to cope with parents who have been diagnosed with a mental illness. It\u2019s this bracket that an upcoming support group network is looking to rally around. Behind the group is Divya Dureja, a counseling psychologist, LGBT activist and TEDx speaker. \u201cIf your parent experiences mental illness, it is normal for you to have all kinds of different feelings,\u201d she reasons. \u201cYou might not understand why your parents act the way they do. It might be hard to know how to understand your parent, or what to do for them.\u201d Divya believes volunteer caregivers need to be empowered as a first line of defence. \u201cI\u2019ve been building frameworks of mental health support groups that don\u2019t seem to exist in our country,\u201d she explained. \u201cOver the past year, I\u2019ve interacted with over 400 students, primarily studying psychology, at panels, summits and workshops, and (also) those individuals who are looking for resources that are empowering to their mental health.\u201d For, psychological well-being is as critical for the ones who deliver care as for those who receive it. And sanctuary can also be found online. On It\u2019s Ok To Talk, the young can share their innermost thoughts through blogs, poetry, video stories, artwork, even audio recordings. But not only the young. Among the personal accounts on the website is a 58-year-old Gurgaon man\u2019s cry from the heart: \u2018Today my heart is brimming painfully with hurt feelings and emotions and there is no one here to share these feelings with or to have a shoulder to cry on little\u2026 I have been facing problems linked with depression, schizophrenia and what not since ages now \u2013 and with me all my family too\u2026\u2019 Proof that age doesn\u2019t discriminate against the despondent of spirit. It\u2019s Ok To Talk reaches out via digital, social media and on-ground activities, which could include public talks, arts-based events and youth leadership programmes. \u201cAnyone can share stories, of lived experiences of mental health and well-being, and the same will have a tremendous impact on those who may be struggling themselves, and help them realise that they are not alone,\u201d informs Sweta Pal, a member of the Delhi team. \u201cBy sharing your own story, you can help inspire other young people that mental health does not need to be shrouded in silence, and it\u2019s ok to talk about it.\u201d Happily, it is becoming easier to talk about mental health, aided by get-togethers that are informal and intimate. And while the fragmented nature of the space means there will always be patients who slip through the cracks, still folks are turning to a growing number of support networks, offering as these do more than a glimmer of hope to the unmoored, the lonely and the vulnerable of India.

In the two drives, traffic police has booked over 1,000 people and seized 31 vehicles. The cops expressed hope such crackdowns on major traffic violations will create deterrence for habitual offenders. The department claimed both drives were in response to citizens\u2019 suggestions on solving the city\u2019s traffic problems, which was initiated earlier this year. Wednesday\u2019s drive was carried out on 27 hotspots, one more than the previous drive, with Nathupur village the new addition to traffic police\u2019s hotlist. All 27 spots were identified after analysing and mapping public responses. The number of violators caught on Wednesday dropped to 420 from 623 on June 12. Similarly, the number of vehicles impounded fell from 17 to 14. Of the 420 violations, the maximum challans \u2014 58 \u2014 were issued near Sheetla Mata Mandir, followed by Sapphire Mall with 43 violations, the stretch between Badshapur and Vatika Chowk with 32 and Hamilton Court road with 30. Sheetla Mata Mandir had also recorded the highest violations during the first drive, though this time, there was a significant dip from 122 violations on June 12. Apart from fining violators, police also seized 14 vehicles \u2014 four from Hamilton Court road, three from Sikanderpur metro station, two from Sector 55/56 metro station, and one each from Sapphire Mall, Sheetla Mata Mandir, Rail Vihar road between sectors 44 and 56, Nathupur and Vyapar Kendra road. Speaking to TOI, the department pointed out that the idea of involving citizens in their policies is yielding encouraging dividends. Not only has the feedback mechanism helped the department mitigate traffic-related issues like road safety and vehicular congestion by planning crackdowns, it has also helped them gain confidence of the public in their efforts to address issues raised by them. Riding high on confidence after the success of the two crackdowns, the department is planning to launch more drives in future, which will take up other major violations like red light jumping, under-age driving, drunken driving, to name a few. In total, about 25,000 vehicles have been booked for wrong-side driving since January this year, with the highest number of challans \u2014 6,514 \u2014 issued in March. According to traffic police, wrong-side driving is not only one of the city\u2019s major traffic violations, but also a major cause of congestions. Meanwhile, traffic congestion at Sirhaul toll on NH 48 was reported due to breakdown of a vehicle at Rajokri service lane towards Delhi. Gurugram traffic police officials rushed to the spot to clear the jam.

Among the farmers who suffer due to non-availability of water at tail end are those from Meham Chaubishi's Nindana, Khattar's native village. While the Meham Minor canal was flowing in full glory on June 16 when this correspondent visited the spot, farmers in villages of Tetri, Kheri and Nindana were using diesal-run tubewell to irrigate their land as the canal by side of their field was lying dry. Talking to TOI, Ramesh Kumar, an aged farmer from Nindana village sitting inside the parched canal at tail-end said that in last five years, not even a drop of water has been seen. \"The BJP government makes hollow claim of providing water to tail-end fields from public stages in urban areas to grab the imagination of voters by talking about transforming the lives of farmers. But the reality for farmers like us remains unchanged. The situation is only turning from bad to worse,\" Kumar added. Holding district irrigation department responsible for the worrisome situation of tail end farmers, 60-year-old farmer said, \"We keep suffering at tail end with parched land while farmers in front areas of the canal enjoy stolen water by bribing the officials and using political pressure,\" he added. Bhoop Singh of Kheri village, who has his two acres at tail-end of Meham minor branch, said that he had heard that farmers commit suicide due to agriculture crisis and he could understand why. \"What should we do with dry land. There is no money to spend on diesel-run tubewells. The expense on one acre get multiplied three times. No money to spend on education of kids. No government official or representative is ready to listen to our woes. They dub us liars when we go to tell them non-availability of water at tail end,\" Singh added. Sandeep Kumar, a young farmer from Nindana village who also has field at Meham Minor tail-end, told TOI that he had complained to irrigation department office and new Rohtak MP Arvind Sharma of water theft from the branch and how they remained deprived of their share of water, but action was still awaited. Rohtak executive engineer (irrigation department) Ram Niwas said that against the demand of 1,875 cusecs, they get only 1450 cusecs water and \"farmers at tail-end were bound to suffer\".

On Saturday, MCG had issued an order to conduct a lift and fire safety audit of buildings which have more than five floors, and are more than 15 metres high. Additional municipal commissioner YS Gupta said a third-party auditor will conduct the inspection of these buildings in the city. Inspection will be conducted at all hospitals, hotels, cultural centres, schools, coaching centres, cracker-making units and other commercial centres.

After receiving several complaints of drunken brawls and nuisance created by those consuming alcohol in open areas, police have launched a drive to tackle the menace on city roads and other open areas. On Wednesday night, around 50 cases were registered against the people for allegedly drinking in open areas. In last six months, around 2,000 cases were registered by police. However, despite frequent police crackdowns, drunken brawls have become common in the city, according to residents. The areas that are frequented by those drinking in public areas include MG Road, Sector 29, DLF-2, Galleria market, Sector 56 market, Palam Vihar, Sushant Lok, Golf Course Road and Southern Peripheral Road (SPR). According to police, those who are caught for drinking in open areas are booked under the Excise Act, and it is the prerogative of the judge to decide the punishment. \u201cThis is a bailable offence, and mostly people are let free after paying fine,\u201d said police spokesperson Subhash Boken, adding that cops take these people in preventive custody and produce them before court from where they are released after paying fines and promising good conduct. Police said they have been receiving several complaints from residents about nuisance by people who drink in open areas. Around 260 cases were registered in this month under the Excise Act. \u201cPolice are acting against such people and every day some cases are registered,\u201d said Boken, adding most cases are registered at Sadar police station. The trend is blamed on increasing number of liquor shops in the city. \u201cThere are liquor vends in every road and street of the city. People start gathering around these vends after 8pm, creating nuisance,\u201d said Sameera Sharma, a resident of Sushant Lok-1, adding that drinking in public areas should be banned. Another resident said drinking at pubs and bars in Gurugram is very costly and no one can afford to visit these outlets regularly. \u201cIt is much cheaper to buy a drink in these liquor shops than going to a swanky pub,\u201d said a resident from Sector 56, adding that owners of these vends do not mind allowing customers to drink outside their shops in their cars. Some people find more convenient places like parking lots, open areas and parks to drink. As per the excise norms, drinking is allowed only in bars, ahatas (areas approved by the administration) and hotels. However, vend owners and boozers are flouting norms almost every day. Deputy excise commissioner HC Dahiya said the excise department has come up with the provision of ahatas near liquor vends to deal with such problem. \u201cDrinking in open is not allowed and people have to either go to pubs and bars or to ahatas,\u201d he said.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The state government introduced prepaid smart meters, on the lines of prepaid mobile phones, in view of the hefty outstanding of the electricity department on consumers and to streamline consumption of power. A smart meter costs Rs 6,000, which would be provided free of cost to the consumers, said an official. Kapur said the department has bought 10 lakh smart meters for the four districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Panchkula and Panipat, and the work to install these meters have already started. \"After installation of these meters, line loss of power would decrease and consumers would be able to get power on prepaid and postpaid basis. Then people would be able to recharge their meters according to their requirement,\" he said. The CMD said that the process for calling a tender to purchase 15 lakh meters for the next phase has been initiated and Jind would be covered in that phase. Last year, Jind district was the biggest defaulter of power bills worth Rs 1,500 crore, of which Rs 1,000 crore has now been settled under the government scheme and Rs 500 crore is yet to be recovered from this district. Once the smart meters are installed, there would be no issue of pending bills, as the department would get the payment in advance. As per current practice, the bills are generated after two months and it takes another month to recover the billed amount. Pending bills are a huge issue for the department. Talking to TOI, V P Thakral, the XEN monitoring Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), said that an amount of Rs 3,400 crore is outstanding on the consumers of 12 districts of the state and around Rs 2,500 crore should be pending of the Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, which covers 10 districts. \"After installing these meters, the bill outstanding issue would vanished completely, as it would be disconnected if not recharged in advance,\" he said. The new concept would work on the lines of a prepaid mobile phone, as one would require to recharge to avail the facility and the department would not need to send an employee for taking meter readings, he noted.

Every day, these teen siblings, pupils of the government senior secondary school in Chakkarpur, confidently wear the badge of student counsellors, while also helping in member outreach through community walks. The library \u2013 free, open to all, and stocking a wide variety of books \u2013 presents a safe learning space for those who do not have access to literature. It has 1,100 members, of which 600 are active. Shubha, a staff member here, calls this their library movement. \u201cOnce other citizens realise the importance of libraries, there will be more of them, and we are demonstrating it through our models,\u201d she tells TOI. So, there\u2019s Manisha, 11, who, recalls Shubha, would initially flip through books and admire illustrations. A year later, she has finished the Hindi translations of six of the Harry Potter series. And Kajal, who trains in a parlour before visiting the library. She wants to become a librarian when she grows up. Mohsin, 16, is another promising child, who yearns to be a cop when he\u2019s old enough \u2013 and, also, be useful around the library on his free Sundays. \u201cI used to while away my summer holidays but now I feel I am learning more geography and history,\u201d shares an eager Mohsin, whose mother works as a domestic help. Tech doesn\u2019t have the touchAt a time when millennials and kids are plugged into their smartphones and tablets, the space for libraries, both intellectually and physically, is shrinking. But seeing the success of Treasure Trove, you wouldn\u2019t think so. Recently, this quaint library, tucked into a basement of a daycare centre to the south of Gurugram, completed nine years. Quirky quotes and colourful posters welcome you to a paradise for the young bibliophile, which has hosted storytelling sessions with popular children\u2019s writer Jeeva Raghunath (who pioneered the storytelling movement in Tamil Nadu) and South African storyteller Bongiswa Kotta Ramushwana. \u201cWhen we moved from Bangalore to Gurugram 10 years back, there was no children\u2019s library here. My daughter loved reading books and my son loved solving jigsaw puzzles. I would buy books but they would finish it in a day or two \u2013 that is when I conceived the idea of a library,\u201d says founder Arvinda Bhatia. \u201cYou can order books online but there are so many new authors who are not read because they are not suggested online \u2013 that is where we come into the picture, (by) suggesting you explore a new book,\u201d she adds. Bhatia remembers a seven-year-old Akshat Gupta, who would cram even the smallest details and conversations while reading at Treasure Trove. He would go on to write seven books in a span of three years. Akshat\u2019s works are given pride of place at the library where he started reading. You can bond with a bookAcross the road is another school library, also accessible to everyone, which houses an eclectic collection for kids between the ages of two and 12 (from \u2018Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People\u2019s Ears\u2019 by Oliver Jeffers to Julia Donaldson\u2019s \u2018The Gruffalo\u2019). The stock at Bookhive, running since 2014, consists of titles the husband-wife duo of Ajay and Ashima Chawla would handpick from their travels. Both developed a love of reading and storytelling because of their son (now in college). \u201cKindle, iPad or any digital media cannot replace the actual touch and feel of a book,\u201d Ashima insists. \u201cIt\u2019s not just having a collection of books but having the right kind of books \u2013 Oliver Jeffers\u2019 \u2018The Day the Crayons Quit\u2019 happens to be the favourite among children of 3-4 years of age,\u201d she reveals, mentioning, proudly, that her most devoted readers are the class-I and class-II children who have finished more than 200 books. The pair recommends other reads by figuring out the interests of their young members. \u201cThe level of customisation is missing when one browses books online from sponsored suggestions \u2013 for instance, how many of us knew the \u2018Queen of Pop\u2019 Madonna is also a children\u2019s book writer?\u201d asks Ajay, pertinently. Yet, even online libraries like Bookpal and Iloveread have their patrons, because of the convenience they offer. \u201cSince everything is far off in the city, and there\u2019s a lack of good bookstores, parents prefer home delivery of books to introduce their children to the joy of reading,\u201d says Shefali Malhotra of Iloveread, adding, \u201cWe are happy to send extra books for parents too.\u201d These volunteers, then, are ensuring that at a time when webpages dominate, the charm of the printed word doesn\u2019t fade among Generation Next.

However, with two flyovers being recently developed at these intersections, the need for traffic lights raises a question over the administration\u2019s planning at the initial stage. At Hero Honda Chowk, an underpass and a flyover, built at a cost of Rs 138 crore, have eased problems for long-route traffic. \u201cThe traffic is smooth while going to or coming from Manesar, but taking a turn towards Sector 10 under the flyover is still cumbersome due to merging vehicles and non-availability of signals,\u201d said Aman Chawla, a city resident. Traffic experts say while the underpass and the flyover have helped in reducing congestion, there are still issues at Hero Honda Chowk due to the movement of vehicles in multiple directions. \u201cAs per my understanding, the traffic lights are being installed to streamline the traffic at the junction, which still sees some haphazard movement,\u201d said Sewa Ram of School of Planning and Architecture. The situation is worst at MDI Chowk. According to MCG sources, the original plan was to build a flyover for traffic coming from Atul Katria Chowk and going towards Signature Towers. However, the plan was later tweaked and the flyover was instead built for the traffic coming from Sukhrali and going towards Atul Kataria Chowk. The last-minute changes at the junction have made the situation worse, causing the need for a traffic signal at the junction. \u201cA study showed that maximum traffic flows from Atul Kataria Chowk towards Signature Towers. This is because a large number of people from Old Gurugram coming towards New Gurugram use Atul Kataria Chowk and MDI Chowk. That was the reason why it was decided to build the flyover in that direction but later on, on the instruction of some bureaucrats, the direction was changed,\u201d said a senior MCG official.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

His late grandfather, Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, was long associated with the Congress. | Full coverage of Lok Sabha elections in MaharashtraAmong other prominent leaders from Maharashtra in the first list of candidates are Union minister Nitin Gadkari from his hometown Nagpur, state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve from Jalna, Union MoS Hansraj Ahir from Chandrapur and Union MoS for defence Subash Bhamre from Dhule.

Sitting MP from Sangli Sanjay Patil has also been renominated, putting an end to speculation over any change in constituency. Patil\u2019s candidature was opposed by a section of BJP leaders in Sangli. However, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is understood to have called a meeting of local party leaders and resolved the differences.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The project was planned over 235 acres falling under Aravali plantation. The committee rejected the proposal saying the area has dense forest with 16,000 trees and 21,000 plants, and is home to many wild species including black buck (Haryana\u2019s state animal) and sambhar. Sources in the ministry said the project was turned down because of two factors. \u201cFirst, Haryana already has very low forest cover \u2014 at 3.59% of its geographical area. Second, Manethi has dense forest with over 16,000 fully-grown trees and is home to many wild species,\u201d said an official, requesting anonymity. Even though the district administration proposed to divert land to the forest department in Masani barrage, so that non-forest activity could be carried out in Manethi, the committee turned down the proposal and suggested the state government should look for alternatives. \u201cDestroying existing, dense forest at Manethi and carrying out fresh plantation at Masani barrage will not only be destructive for the environment, but also will not be cost effective. We\u2019ve suggested the government should look for an alternative site. In fact, Masani barrage could be a good option to build the healthcare facility,\u201d said the official. Calling it a violation of the Supreme Court judgement, former forest conservator R P Balwan told TOI, \u201cThe proposal was bound to be rejected. In the case of T N Godavarman Thirumulpad vs Union of India, the Supreme Court clearly said \u2018forest\u2019 must be understood according to its \u2018dictionary meaning\u2019. In many other orders, the same was reiterated by the Apex court. The Aravali plantation, therefore, is clearly deemed forest. Authorities should have applied their mind before proposing a project on forest land. There is a large chunk of land owned by panchayats in the state. Establishing AIIMS is certainly important, but it can easily be planned on panchayat or private land.\u201d Talking about the importance of the Manethi forest, renowned forester and former principal chief conservator of forests (Rajasthan) R N Mehrotra, said, \u201cManethi has dense forest which is home to many wild species. Most importantly, the globally threatened White-naped Tit (parus nuchalis) is found here. Also, the Aravali foothills have huge ecological importance as it recharges groundwater. There is a need to protect such forests as we are already facing climate emergency.\u201d During 1990s and 2000s, European Union funds were spent to carry out plantation in the Aravalis. Nearly 3.3 crore trees were planted at a cost of Rs 175 crore, over 30,000 hectares across 13 districts that comprise of Aravalis in Haryana. That included district Rewari, where plantation was carried out on 412 hectare in Manethi.

He is also the founder of Gramin Healthcare, a startup that, since 2016, has endeavoured to make quality healthcare accessible to the rural population. \u201cRural India still requires a medical practitioner to be physically present there \u2014 digital might be a good backup but healthcare delivery requires brick-and-mortar,\u201d maintains Khandheria.  Switching domains I still hold equity in a few telecom companies, in Singapore, Dubai, India, etc., but I decided to go with a startup in healthcare. The first part of that startup was to provide consulting to Tier-2 hospitals and re-engineer them so they could increase their effectiveness. The idea was a replica of what Genpact does \u2014 increase the value and then take a share of the increment. But we realised it was very difficult to collect from the promoter in private hospitals. Then we decided to diversify and build orthopaedic and cardiac practices in hospitals in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities that did not have this service, which was actually not very scalable. From there we morphed into (providing) a second opinion for surgery patients online. Again, that was not scalable because everyone wanted to speak to the same (famous) doctor who could take only that many calls.  Dilemma & solution Some three year ago, a former colleague had joined IFFCO and told me about some horrible debt-trap stories due to hospital bills that drive a number of farmers/labourers to suicide. So, we decided to open brick-and-mortar clinics. IFFCO at that time was setting up IFFCO Bazar\u2019s showrooms in villages by providing guidance to farmers on fertilisers, seeds and crops. But farmers kept demanding from IFFCO that we want healthcare and education. So it was decided that we set up a clinic with IFFCO Bazar. We started off with a partnership but after a few months, they realised the outcomes were good so they agreed to make us shareholders.  Partners in rural health Now we are by far the largest primary-care provider in rural India but we are probably less than 0.1% of the market, so there is a lot more that needs to be done. I hope other people learn from what we are doing because four-five new players will allow us to address 25% of the population over five years. We are also implementing Ayushman Bharat in Maharashtra and Haryana. Currently, we are spread in seven states but working with the Haryana government has been our best experience \u2014 they are very aggressive people, interested in doing good work, and very supportive.  Work/life: Finding the balance I actually do not work like an entrepreneur; I give more importance to family than work. Each year for the last eight years, I have spent 60 days straight with my kids. I learn a lot from my kids and I hope they learn something from me. Besides, I follow every sport on Planet Earth. I play golf and another sport which is not considered a sport by some \u2014 poker.

This sums up a visitor\u2019s experience of the city\u2019s arterial link \u2014 MG Road. With numerous malls, residential apartments, public and private offices along it, the road is forever jam-packed with commuters, especially during peak hours. The volume of traffic can be gauged from the presence of two of the city\u2019s main metro stations here \u2014 MG Road and Sikanderpur \u2014 used daily by lakhs of officegoers from the city and its NCR neighbours. The administration has made many commitments in the past towards maintaining and beautifying the stretch. Last year, many master roads in the city, including MG Road, were transferred to GMDA.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India.

He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Yadav, who was the forest minister during the Congress regime, said he had been saying AIIMS can\u2019t be set up on the land in Manethi village as it falls in the forest area, and now the forest advisory committee (FAC) of ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF & CC) has denied environmental clearance to the project. However, when contacted, Inderjit Singh said the matter is under consideration with the Centre. \u201cWe are working on it. The issue of land for AIIMS in Rewari will be sorted out soon,\u201d he said. During the Lok Sabha election campaign, Inderjit had promised to set up AIIMS in Rewari. A source in the chief minister\u2019s office said Manohar Lal Khattar had in 2015 announced setting up of AIIMS in Manethi village of Rewari. However, when nothing happened till 2018, villagers went on an indefinite strike which lasted for 127 days. Before the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP government in the state had cleared the project worth Rs 1,299 crore in a cabinet meeting. It also earmarked 200-acre land with the help of the panchayat. Speaking to TOI, Yadav said the BJP MP should resign on moral grounds as he has played with the sentiments of people of south Haryana. \u201cEven the former finance minister of the country had announced that funds have been passed for AIIMS. But it turned out to be another \u2018jumla\u2019 before the elections,\u201d he said.

This is the 11th big cat to have died in the Gurugram and Faridabad area in the past decade. Villagers found the leopard hanging from 11kV high-tension wires near an Ailanthus excelsa (ullu neem) tree at 6.15am and called police, which reached the spot around 7.30am. Officials from the wildlife department arrived at 9am and took the carcass off the wire after cutting off the power supply. A post-mortem confirmed that the leopard, which weighed about 30 kilograms, had died of charring of multiple organs. According to Shyam Sunder Kaushik, district forest officer (wildlife), Gurugram, the leopard may have been trying to catch prey. \u201cThe carcass was entangled in the branches of the tree, which were also charred. The big cat might have climbed it to follow a monkey or langur. Its mouth may have become entangled in the wire, leading to electrocution.\u201d Satvir Singh, a villager who was first to spot the carcass, said, \u201cI was going to the temple when I saw a big cat hanging from the wires. When I called for help, many people gathered at the spot. We realised the leopard was dead. Its lower jaw was charred and mouth and ears were bleeding.\u201d TOI visited the spot and found that the wires had been laid in the forest area about two years ago to supply power to Neelkanth temple, located about 150 metres away. The team also spotted nail marks of the leopard on the Ailanthus excelsa tree. As there is a water body right next to the tree, many animals, including monkeys, peacocks and bluebulls, visit the area every day. Locals alleged that the lack of water holes in the area force leopards to come to this village. \u201cIn 2016, when a leopard strayed into neighbouring Mandawar village, we requested the forest department to build some water holes so that wild animals don\u2019t have to come to this area,\u201d said Kapil Khatana, a resident of Kherli Lala. Some activists, however, said the leopard may have been trying to hide from humans and got electrocuted in the process. \u201cIt may have climbed up the tree to get a vantage view, rest or hide itself if it perceived a threat. It might have been unfamiliar with the area too,\u201d said Prerna Bindra, former member, standing committee, National Board for Wildlife. She added that a decline in the prey base in the Aravalis could have forced big cats to come to human habitation in search of animals such as dogs and cattle. Urging vigilance, Bindra said: \u201cElectrocution can be deliberate \u2014 for poaching, retaliatory killing or bush meat. Haphazardly strung power lines often prove fatal for birds and bats. If there are wires, they must be underground.\u201d Activists said protection for villages like Kherli Lala and Mandawar that are situated in the wildlife corridor between Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary of Delhi and Sariska Tiger Reserve of Rajasthan. \u201cEven though this is an accidental case, there is a clear case of negligence from the discom, Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN). It should have pruned the tree\u2019s branches. There is a need to protect the wildlife corridor from all possible threats, including urbanisation. For many years, this has been an important passage as well as habitat for leopards in the Aravalis,\u201d said Amit Chaudhery, a wildlife activist. When asked if the department was going to take this up with the discom, Vinod Kumar, additional principal chief conservator of forests, told TOI, \u201cIt is a case of electrocution. We have informed the area\u2019s lineman and will write to them to prune the branches along high-tension wires.

Sources said the party is seriously considering the move despite the fact that both of Selja and Hooda lost the recent elections from Ambala and Sonipat, respectively. Party sources said Selja could be a replacement for Ashok Tanwar, who also lost from Sirsa parliamentary seat. Hooda could be made CLP chief as well as the chairman of the coordination committee. Congress Haryana affairs in-charge Ghulam Nabi Azad has proposed this formula to the party high command, sources said. The final nod has to come from AICC president Rahul Gandhi. Sources said the picture will be clear in Haryana once Rahul takes a final decision about his own resignation as party chief. The Congress suffered a humiliating defeat as it lost all the 10 constituencies to the BJP, including Rohtak and Sonipat constituencies which were considered to be its safest bets in the state. Hooda's son Deepender failed to retain the family bastion of Rohtak. Afterwards, the rift among the leaders intensified as was evident during the meeting of coordination committee wherein state Congress chief Tanwar was targeted. Hooda group had sought removal of Tanwar as the state president and Kiran Choudhary as CLP leader.

From 147 juveniles who faced trial for criminal activities in 2013, the number has shot up to 209 in 2018. In 2019 (till March), 46 juveniles have been booked and apprehended for their involvement in crimes. A police officer said juveniles mostly start with petty crimes like theft and snatching. With time, they graduate to heinous offences like rape and murder. Criminal gangs nurture juveniles and use them to execute crimes as they face lenient punishments under the Juvenile Justice Act, with a maximum punishment of three years in a correction home. According to the data received via an RTI query filed by activist Aseem Takyar, from 147 cases against juveniles in 2013, the number rose to 175 in 2014, and remained almost the same in 2015. Over the next two years, the numbers even dipped to 159 in 2016 and 148 in 2017. But in 2018, it again saw a steep rise. A police officer said most of the big criminals have committed crimes at a young age. To support his argument, he said in January this year, Gurugram police had arrested gangster Kaushal\u2019s aide Chand (21), a shooter who had committed eight murders in Gurugram, Rewari and Delhi, with his first murder recorded in 2013 at the age of 16. At the age of 19, he had played a key role in the murder of rival gangster Mahesh \u2018Attack\u2019 in Gurugram 2016. Police said in the \u2018Attack\u2019 murder, Chand was accompanied by Sanjeet Vidroh, who was killed in an encounter by Delhi Police in Chhattarpur in 2018. Vidroh was also 16-years-old in 2016 when he took part in Attack\u2019s murder. At 17, he was involved in the murder of liquor baron Manish Gujjar, brother of gangster Binder Gujjar and rival of gangster Sandeep Gadoli, who had by then been killed by Gurugram police in a hotel in Mumbai\u2019s Andheri on July 6, 2016. \u201cThese are some incidents in which juveniles committed heinous crimes and went on to become big criminals,\u201d said the police officer, adding that gangs catch them young and train them to become contract killers. In most cases, they start with petty crimes like snatching and theft, and graduate to heinous crimes. Elaborating further, he said teenagers are generally more aggressive and easily manipulated, and don\u2019t come under police radar. In case they are caught, the punishment is lenient. Even for heinous offences like rape or murder, the maximum sentence a juvenile gets is three years in a correction home. ACP (crime) Shamsher Singh on Monday said they had arrested two teenagers in connection with the murder of a trader in Sadar Bazar. \u201cDuring interrogation, they revealed they were inspired by older gangsters and wanted to emulate them. They picked up the gun to make their mark,\u201d said Singh. A professor of sociology at Delhi School of Economics, Sunil Babu, said besides the juvenile, parents, friends and teachers are all responsible in some way or another for such developments. \u201cStudies have shown that incidents of juvenile crime have increased due to lower social, economic or psychological backgrounds. In cases where juveniles from even well-to-do families venture into crime, their families are the prime reason,\u201d said Babu, adding that it\u2019s important to keep talking to teenagers and monitor their friends and associates.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Shah, under whose leadership the Haryana BJP scripted historic victory of 10/10 seats in the recent Lok Sabha polls, was scheduled to reach Rohtak on Thursday night and leave for Delhi after attending morning Yoga Day event the next morning. Previously, Rohtak had been a stronghold of former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and his son -- three-time MP Deepender Singh. But both tall Jat leaders were defeated by BJP nominees in Sonipat and Rohtak in the recent parliamentary elections. Political analysts see this development as a morale booster for the state BJP for achieving its target of \u201cAbki Baar 75 Paar\u201d and many of the local leaders have been making a beeline to join the BJP since the rout of opposition. Khattar reached Rohtak on Thursday evening to oversee the preparations for the Yoga Day event, while DGP Manoj Yadav was in the city to see the security measures taken for the gathering of VVIPs. Rohtak deputy commissioner R S Verma said for a smooth conduct of event, it has been divided into 63 sectors under the supervision of 13 sector magistrates and Patanjali Yoga experts. The police said they have set up 18 check-points around the Rohtak city and those coming to attend the event would be able to reach the venue directly without entering the city.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

Emerald Estate residents have been complaining to MCG for months that encroachers were setting up illegal shops on the green belt in their neighbourhood \u2014 where they have been planting trees to increase green cover \u2014 eating away the green belt and compromising the safety and security of hundreds of families living in condominiums on the stretch. The complainants said they have pleaded with MCG officials to take immediate action against the encroachers, before the green zone turned into an illegal vending zone. MCG officials acknowledged that the encroachments have not only destroyed the green space, but also deprived pedestrians of space. Roadside parking is another problem, which they said causes huge traffic jams on the stretch during peak hours. A senior MCG official told TOI that many illegal shops, eateries and liquor vends have come up on the road between sectors 62 and 65, which have spoiled the development plan of the authorities, adding that after Tuesday\u2019s tweet by a resident, they decided to take immediate action, and sent over a team at around 2pm, who removed all encroachments. \u201cEncroachments on SPR have given rise to security concerns in the area and made the area accident-prone,\u201d said Abhay Singh, a resident of Emerald Estate, whose tweet precipitated Tuesday\u2019s anti-encroachment drive.

With the illicit shops now removed, we can resume our plantation drive.\u201d But he added, \u201cMCG needs to keep a tab on this area as these illegal vendors may return soon.\u201d Additional municipal commissioner Y S Gupta said, \u201cOn the strict instructions of newly appointed commissioner Vinay Singh, regarding removal of illegal encroachments, the MCG team acted promptly and cleared the encroachment in Sector 65.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "RCB team 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rcb-team-2019-players-list-royal-challengers-bangalore-team-2019/articleshow/67151637.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Delhi Capitals team": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/delhi-capitals-team-2019-players-list-delhi-team-2019/articleshow/67149933.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "'Batti Gul Meter Chalu': All you need to know about the Shahid Kapoor-Shraddha Kapoor starrer": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/batti-gul-meter-chalu-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-shahid-kapoor-shraddha-kapoor-starrer/photo-yami-gautam-looks-absolutely-ravishing-in-a-black-dress/photostory/65791732.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Bollywood actors who resorted to public transport": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/bollywood-actors-who-resorted-to-public-transport/photostory/65676673.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "BJP List 2019 Tamilnadu": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/no-surprise-list-bjp-pits-tamilisai-against-k-kanimozhi/articleshow/68515621.cms?", "time": "", "description": "CHENNAI: The BJP's Tamil Nadu candidates list announced on Thursday was on expected lines, with Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan being fielded from Kanyakumari, state chief Tamilisai Soundararajan in Tuticorin, national secretary H Raja in Sivaganga, C P Radhakrishnan in Coimbatore and vice-president Nainar Nagendran in Ramanathapuram.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa.
