Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Mobike\u2019s cycles may be taken off city roads within the next three months and scrapped, sources from the company said. Once it happens, Mobike would become the third company to pull out of the scheme after early starters Ofo and Pedl. \u201cThe anticipation of the response that the company had for the cycle scheme in Pune was not met. We are also pulling out in other cities of the world. Our focus will now be only on China,\u201d Adarsh Kedari, Pune city head, Mobike, told TOI. The public bicycle sharing (PBS) scheme has run into multiple hurdles in Pune, with lack of proper cycle infrastructure and end-to-end connectivity being the foremost. Absence of cycles around key high footfall locations, like railway stations, and poor cycle design are other challenges that came to haunt the service in the city. Confirming the development, Narendra Salunkhe, PMC\u2019s incharge of public bicycle sharing scheme, said, \u201cThere are problems in the cycle sharing system and Mobike is on the verge of pulling out but we are yet to have a formal discussion.\u201d On the part of the Pune Municipal Corporation, civic officials accepted that it had not invested anything in the scheme and had only given consent to the operators to function in the city. Earlier this year, Salunkhe had said that Pedl had pulled out due to some \u201cdesign flaws\u201d and would reintroduce the cycles in two months. However, that did not happen. Different operators estimate that they need anywhere between 4-10 rides per cycle for the operations to be successful. However, in the past few months, most cycles have not been able to garner even one ride per cycle. A lot of Mobike\u2019s bikes stand unused on JM Road and FC Road. Yulu to ride onThe only other surviving PBS company \u2014 Yulu Bikes \u2014 has said the present situation offers a good opportunity for it to expand to other areas of the city. \u201cYulu is doing better and utilisation rates have improved over the last six months by 15-20%. We are in a good space to fill in the space vacated by other competitors,\u201d Ritesh Rathore, Pune city head, Yulu Bikes, said. He said Yulu would expand to other pockets of Koregaon Park, Kalyaninagar and add 400-500 more cycles for the expansion. Yulu currently has 2,500 cycles on city roads \u2013 mostly operating in the areas of Pimple Saudagar, Pimple Gurav, Hinjewadi and Aundh. It also has another 500 as reserve bikes used for events and rallies, among others. After Mobike\u2019s departure, the city will only be left with Yulu\u2019s 3,000-odd shared cycles from about 8,000 when all operators were functioning in different pockets of the city.

But they haven\u2019t been able to store any water during the last rainy season, thanks to faulty equipment and lack of checks. In fact, during the summer months the members of the society spent over Rs3lakh on water tankers to meet their requirement. Many other housing societies in Wagholi face a similar condition. Developers showcase water harvesting units but these aren\u2019t installed by experts. Most units are rendered useless soon enough. \u201cThe system does not have a collection unit and so we have practically not been able to store any rainwater at all,\u201d said Nitin Kumar Jain, a resident of Suyog Nisarg. Several housing societies in Kharadi too do not have access to a proper system, shared Nitin Memane, chairman of the Kharadi Housing Society Welfare Association. \u201cNearly 35 housing societies have these dysfunctional units. The developer showcases these units to get rebates from the local authority. But the units are of no practical use,\u201d said Memane. Recently, the chief minister reiterated that the state was stressing on an effort to enforce rain water harvesting in cities at a Niti Aayog meeting. The state has approved 13,277 such plans in major cities like Pune, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur, Pimpri-Chinchwad, and Thane Municipal Corporations, However there are no checks in the system. Eminent scientist and hydrogeologist Shashank Deshpande stated that rainwater harvesting measures need to be implemented based on availability of productive aquifers. Filters should be compulsorily installed in the rainwater harvesting measures. At locations where aquifers are not available, rooftop rain water storage measures should be promoted. Col Shashikant Dalvi (retd), who is among the pioneers in installing the system in his own society at Vimannagar, said that there are thousands of such systems constructed by developers without considering a proper study and survey of the area\u2019s hydrogeology. \u201cMost structures are wrongly designed or not maintained. The builders don\u2019t hand over the civil drawings or maintenance chart to the society and, in most cases, the society is also not bothered to undertake periodic maintenance, which practically leaves the system defunct,\u201d he explained.

Data from IMD revealed that monsoon reached the state between June 4 and 11 since 2011, except in 2016. It touched the state on June 19 then. This year, monsoon covered some parts of Maharashtra on June 20 \u2014 the longest delay in its onset in the state since 2016. Officials from the state agriculture department said the delay in monsoon in Maharashtra might have an impact on Kharif crops like paddy, mung, urad, jowar and bajra. The delay in monsoon onset over Kerala, too was the longest this year. It reached the coastal state on June 8, mirroring the trend in 2016. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, told TOI that monsoon reached Nicobar on May 18, but it got delayed by the time it reached Andamans. \u201cThe conditions became favourable on May 30. The development of the Arabian Sea monsoon branch began by June 3. There too, various onset criteria took time to get fulfilled,\u201d he said. Kashyapi said possibly the extremely severe cyclonic storm Fani disrupted the monsoon flow over the Bay of Bengal initially and caused a 10-day delay in the case of Andaman onset and the coverage of monsoon over the Bay of Bengal in May. \u201cSevere cyclonic storm Vayu further disrupted the monsoon flow, causing an overall delay in onset over the southern peninsula and in Maharashtra,\u201d he said. A major impact of the delayed monsoon onset over Maharashtra could be seen on agriculture and Kharif crops. A state agriculture department official said the long delay in the onset was likely to delay paddy transplantation in the state, which might ultimately affect the paddy production. \u201cAlso, major Kharif crops like mung, urad, jowar, bajra tur and cotton can be affected due to late sowing. Farmers have been advised not to start sowing till the state gets proper rain. It means, the flowering or grain formation stage of such crops may occur in September and October. Rain spells during the flowering stage or grain formulation stage is detrimental to some crops, which can ultimately affect the production,\u201d he said. The official said farmers in some parts had begun \u201cdry sowing\u201d despite the advisory. \u201cIn such a case, a delay of rainfall can increase the chances of re-sowing,\u201d he said. An official from the state water resources department said the current water storage in dams was sufficient to meet the drinking water needs till July 15. \u201cThe maximum effect of the delayed rains would be felt in Kharif season because a delay in sowing tends to affect the crop production,\u201d he said. He said monsoon could be delayed every year. \u201cBut we plan water in such a way that even if it does not rain till July 15, the water is sufficient, especially for drinking,\u201d the official said.

A total of 188 people have died of the contagion in Maharashtra this year so far. Of them, 110 patients (58%) did not have any other underlying medical conditions when they developed the virus-related complications, including severe breathlessness, which is medically termed as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. \u201cThe analysis of swine flu casualties clearly shows that more patients without other associated diseases have died of the H1N1 virus in Maharashtra than individuals with underlying medical conditions this year so far,\u201d a senior state health ministry official said. \u201cDelayed treatment is mainly the cause of most deaths,\u201d senior public health expert Subhash Salunkhe, who also heads the state\u2019s technical committee on communicable diseases, told TOI. Senior physician D B Kadam, an expert member at the state government\u2019s technical committee on swine flu, said, \u201cDelayed treatment and over-reactive immune response to viral infections are mainly the reasons why such individuals died of swine flu.\u201d Doctors said it was extremely important to initiate anti-viral medication within first 48 hours of swine flu infection. \u201cDuring season like this when there is active virus transmission, a patient should consult a doctor even for cough and cold,\u201d Kadam, who is a senior professor of medicine at Navale Medical College and Hospital, said. He said, \u201cIt is crucial to check the virus before it gets attached to the alveolar cells of the lungs. Once the virus is attached to these cells, it becomes very difficult to control the damage to the lungs.\u201d If there is a delay in starting the oseltamivir, popularly known as Tamiflu or Fluvir course, the infection can easily spread to the patient\u2019s lungs. \u201cThis could lead to development of pneumonia, which could further hamper absorption of oxygen into blood. That is how the condition of a swine flu patient becomes critical,\u201d Kadam said. Normal partial pressure of oxygen in blood should be around 98 to 110mm of mercury. However, when a patient develops pneumonia, this concentration of oxygen drops. \u201cTo improve the condition, nasal-oxygen is provided to raise the oxygen level in patients initially. If that fails, mask oxygen is used to raise the blood oxygen level. However, if both methods fail, we must use a non-invasive ventilator. And the last resort is putting the patient on full ventilator support when an endotracheal tube (tube placed in the windpipe) is put,\u201d he said, adding that ventilator-related complications, like acute respiratory distress syndrome and bacterial co-infection, were common among patients. Kadam also attributed high death toll in the healthy group to \u201ccytokine storm\u201d or hyperactive immune system. \u201cWhenever an individual with a healthy and intact immune system encounters a new infectious agent, a robust immune response is mounted. If this new agent is a highly pathogenic one, the immune system might overreact, with secretion of a large amount of inflammatory chemicals called cytokines. These cytokines have the potential to do more harm than good as they lead to severe inflammation and tissue destruction,\u201d he said. That simply means that over-reactive immunity which is often seen among healthy individuals may prove counter-reproductive and cause more damage to the lungs. Two more test positive for contagionTwo more people tested positive for swine flu in the city on Thursday. With this, the number of positive cases recorded in the city has gone up to 138 this year so far. Of the 138 patients, 43 have succumbed to the contagion.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh.

Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Fortunately, the student suffered only minor bruises on her hands and face as the autorickshaw had slowed down when she jumped out. The police arrested the 22-year-old driver, Ravi Shanker Gofne, after the student lodged a complaint. Gofne was produced before a local court on Thursday, which remanded him in judicial custody. According to the police, the incident took place around 2.50pm when the student was going home. A police official said, \"The driver started passing obscene remarks at the student, which got her panicky. The driver then suddenly caught hold of her right hand. The student protested and told the driver to stop the vehicle as she wanted to get down. However, the driver refused to stop.\" The official said, \"When the autorickshaw slowed down along the service road in the Garware Point area, the student suddenly jumped out.\" Local residents and passersby were taken aback by the incident and rushed to help her. They also stopped the autorickshaw and overpowered the driver. Local police along with the Nirbhaya squad - a team of policewomen formed to deal with male harassers - rushed to the spot and took the driver into custody. Sub-inspector Adinath More of the Indiranagar police station said the autorickshaw that Gofne was plying belonged to someone else. \"Though Gofne claimed he has a valid driving licence, he could not produce it. Our investigations are on to ascertain whether he had a licence at all,\" said More.

The officer said was hopeful that the autorickshaw drivers would join the initiative and cater to passengers through the four booths. \u201cAt the end, they also want business. The infighting was about which union would start the booths. Now that the job has been taken care, they will use them,\u201d Deshmukh said.

A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

The division\u2019s chairman BK Dahiphale said the number of applications is similar to last year\u2019s and there has been no significant rise despite a low pass percentage. The process for secondary school certificate (SSC, STD X) revaluation process was underway and the demand will be clear next week. One of the most common mistakes found in the evaluation process was faulty totalling. Besides, the students who felt that their marks were not up to their expectations applied for re-evaluation. The process started the day after the results for the SSC and HSC examinations were declared. The Pune division received close to 300 applications which included students applying for photocopies of their answer sheets to know the marks awarded by the assessors. Dahiphale told TOI on Thursday that a majority of applications for re-evaluation were for subjects that were important for students applying for admissions to professional courses like engineering and medical. For such students, marks in subjects such as physics, chemistry, biology and maths are more important as their admission was dependent on these marks and stiff competition makes every mark important, he said. A student who had qualified for the joint entrance exam (JEE) Main but failed in two subjects in standard XII decided to appear for the July/August supplementary examination instead of waiting for the re-evaluation results. \u201cThe process after getting the photocopy is lengthy and we didn't think there would be much change in the marks. Hence, we applied for the re-examination so that he can study again and appear for the exam which will also ensure he scores better than just the passing marks in the subjects,\u201d the student's mother said. \u201cHe is in the open category and the qualifying marks required in open category for the national institutes are high. Hence, he needs to score better,\u201d she added. The parent of a standard X student who had applied for revaluation on the very first day said she is yet to get the photocopy of the answer sheet. \u201cFYJC admissions have started. I applied for the photocopies of answer sheets in two subjects but students who applied later have got it. I have not. The process is blurred and nobody in the division has a clear idea when the student may get the photocopy. I have already visited the board office twice but in vain. There should be a better system for parents and students to track the status of our application for photocopy and revaluation. The entire process is tiring as there are very few days for first round of FYJC admissions,\u201d the parent said.

While the earthquake was of 4.8 magnitude, the aftershock was of magnitude 3. However, no loss of life or property has been reported. The earthquake occurred around 20km from the Koyna dam in Satara, India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials told TOI. The depth of the first shock was 10 km below the earth surface. The officials said this was the first earthquake of such magnitude to have occurred in this part of Satara in some years. During the last seven years, earthquakes of magnitude 1 to 4.5 have been recorded in this region. Officials said the epicentre of the quake was considerably distant from the Koyna dam, which is usually a hot spot for earthquakes. Thursday was the first time in 2019 that an earthquake had occurred in this region in Satara. As per details provided by the IMD, the latitude and longitude of the location is 17.3\u00b0N 73.8\u00b0E. Since the beginning of 2019, Palghar has been the only location in the state affected by a series of earthquakes. Officials from the IMD\u2019S seismology department said the aftershock, which originated at a depth of 5km below the earth\u2019s surface, was felt around 8.27am. \u201cThe aftershock was relatively shallow. Data over the past few years has shown that though one earthquake on an average affects this location each year, quakes with magnitude of 4 or more are less common here,\u201d an official said. In 2012, the location had recorded an earthquake of 4.9 magnitude. In 2013, 2015 and 2016, no earthquakes were recorded in this region. Also, during the last seven years, the epicentre has remained almost the same, IMD officials said. \u201cEarthquakes between 1 to 5 magnitude are termed light, while those from 5.1 to 6.9 magnitude are termed moderate. Thursday\u2019s tremor was a light one. Preliminary investigations revealed that the quake could have occurred due to a faultline in the tectonic plates in the crust. The faultline in question could have been the one extending from the Koyna region or one that has developed somewhere in this region itself where the tremors were felt,\u201d the official said. The official said that as tectonic plates shift constantly, the stress build-up can increase at times, activating a faultline. This can cause tremors in a region.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

Sapkal had first filed an application with the cybercrime cell, which, after a preliminary probe, transferred the case to the Pimpri Chinchwad police. The FIR was registered on Wednesday. The police have registered the case under IPC sections 419 and 420, as well as the relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act. Sapkal told TOI that he was in his shop on January 29, when he got a call from a man, who said he got his number through a search engine. \u201cThe man told me that he wanted to buy four tyres for a Maruti Ertiga car and asked me the price,\u201d Sapkal said. \u201cI told him it would cost Rs17,400, and he said he would pay online.\u201d The suspect further told Sapkal that his driver would come to the shop to change the tyres. \u201cHe asked me for my mobile number linked to a digital wllet, and then said he would send a link to that number.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Based on a purported letter of credit issued by one of the Pune-based branch of Canara Bank, BoI advanced credit worth Rs293 crore to Varron in two tranches in early 2016. BoI claimed that it had verified the signature of the Canara Bank official concerned. Letter of credits (LC) are akin to guarantees where the issuing bank undertakes to indemnify the other bank if the beneficiary fails to pay back the amount. BoI, however, alleged in its complaint that when it approached Canara Bank, the latter refused to have issued any such letter. This, Bank of India said, caused a loss of Rs293 crore to it. BoI also alleged in its complaint that it had extended the credit based on a manual LC because the Pune-based branch of Canara Bank had issued it earlier as well and the mechanisms had worked fine till then. \u201cWhen the case of Varron was taken up with Canara Bank\u2019s head office, the then bank MD and CEO stated that the purported LC was neither issued nor bills accepted by their branch through approved mode of structured financial messaging system,\u201d BoI said in its complaint in 2017. \u201cInvestigation under prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 so far has revealed that said money was immediately transferred through various accounts and finally utilized for settling old dues and making fixed deposits. Further investigation to establish the money trail and corresponding attachments is under progress,\u201d the ED said in a note. A CBI official said the ED might have got into it now because they might have suspected some money laundering activities at the company. He said ED \u201ctakes independent action\u201d based on complaints to CBI. Sawaikar could not be reached for comments till the time of going to press.

Bhima river flows through the middle of the village. Wolves often come out at night in search of prey. Most of the farmers have wells on their fields without any barricade. Forest officials said wild animals such as wolves and leopards often fall in these wells while chasing their prey. Earlier this year, a wolf was rescued from a well in Varchi Bhamburdi village.

School education minister Ashish Shelar on Tuesday had said that the government had decided to increase the number of seats in popular junior colleges in Mumbai, Pune, and Nagpur based on the number of state board, ICSE and CBSE students applying for admissions. The schools and college heads said that arts and commerce faculties would not face issues while accommodating extra students in the classrooms due to availability of larger classrooms, but colleges with science stream will have to arrange for extra batches for practicals and hire teachers and lab technicians on a temporary basis. A M Shaikh, principal of Shri Mhalasakant Vidyalaya, Akurdi, said the trend last year was of most students opting for commerce which he thinks will continue this year too PB Buchade, principal of Abasaheb Garware College, also said that the move though beneficial for the students will become an inconvenience for the college managements. \u201cOne teacher has to hold the attention of 120 students at a time which is an impossible task. Now, we have seven divisions in the science stream and two divisions in the arts stream which means 108 additional students. We need more teachers for sure and additional batches for practical sessions. Hence, we may need to recruit teachers or lab assistants on contract basis once we see how the classes are going,\u201d he said. Rohini Patwardhan, principal MIT school and Junior College said that it is a challenge to accommodate additional students without lowering the quality and hence any college would need to employ additional staff. \u201cThe same number of students will be there for the next year too which is the crucial class XII. We have already seen a decrease in the marks in standard XII and this may not be the ideal solution to improve the condition. Most colleges that have compulsory attendance are not preferred by students because they prefer to go to colleges where attendance is given without checking so that these students can enroll in coaching classes. New colleges are given permission and there is vacancy in traditional colleges where rules are stricter. Everybody knows what is happening in most colleges but there is hardly any check on them and no action is taken resulting in bad results,\u201d Patwardhan said. Hrishikesh Soman, principal of Symbiosis College of Arts, Science and Commerce called the government\u2019s intentions good, but implementation faulty. \u201cI am not against the move; it is a good move. But the way it is being implemented will ultimately benefit nobody. The technicalities are still not sorted. Each division will have 12 more students in my college. The government does not want to spend more on teachers\u2019 salaries so they\u2019re increasing per class additional students. Student teacher relationship should be healthy.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls.

The police also arrested three members of a family for selling the invalid stamp papers. Senior inspector Sunil Kalgutkar of Vishrambaug police told TOI that Chinmay Deshpande (26), his father Suhas (58) and mother Sucheta (54), all residents of Kasba Peth, were arrested for the alleged forgery. \u201cWe have recovered forged stamp papers worth Rs68.38 lakh from their possession,\u201d he said. In addition, the police recovered a state treasury rubber stamp and a register maintained by stamp vendors. The police have invoked charges of cheating and invoked provisions of the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act. Kalgutkar said, \u201cUsually, the vendors obtain stamp papers from the state treasury to sell to customers. However, the authorized state treasury officer stamps and signs it before handing it over to the vendor for sale. In this case, it was found that the three were selling stamp papers using bogus and forged rubber stamp that had details of an officer of the state treasury, who authorizes the stamp papers for sale. Further, the three were found signing the document as treasury officers.\u201d The police is investigating how the vendor got such stamp papers and how they were taken out of the state treasury for sale. Kalgutkar said that the vendor claimed to have paid the state treasury before obtaining the unsigned documents. Kalgutkar said that the police on Wednesday contacted the state treasury department and the office of the Inspector General of Registrar (IGR) to investigate the case. \u201cRight now, we have registered a case of cheating against the suspects and we will invoke forgery charges in due course,\u201d Kalgutkar said. As the stamp papers are being treated as forged, it is suspected that the three have sold such papers earlier as well. Many would have been used to execute business deals and other legal transactions. \u201cThe case will not impact old transactions. Although the stamp papers are forged, the deals were genuine,\u201d Kalgutkar said.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

This involved fine-tuning his dialysis and treating his complications.Elaborating on the complexities, Patil said, \u201cIt involved connecting a part of the small intestine and whole pancreas to major blood vessels on one side of the pelvis and then connecting the kidney to the blood vessels and urinary bladder on the opposite side.\u201d This required critical monitoring throughout and immediately after the surgery. Hospital\u2019s anaesthetist Sujit Saraf, intensivist Prasad Akole, gastroenterologist Sachin Palnitkar provided the medical care with Mulay during this period.\u201cFor someone like this young man with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes and complications like hypoglycemia (blood sugars less than 70), renal failure, cardiopulmonary failure, pancreas transplant is a life-saving operation. The transplant surgery provides freedom from dialysis and better quality of life,\u201d Patil said.Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "6 reservoirs sans live storage in Maharashtra, highest in country": {"datetime": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/6-reservoirs-sans-live-storage-in-maharashtra-highest-in-country/articleshow/69865775.cms", "time": "2019-06-20 13:59:00", "description": "PUNE: Maharashtra currently has the highest number of reservoirs without live water storage in the country. Of the 91 reservoirs the Central Water Commission (CWC) monitors, six in Maharashtra have reached the no live storage level. Sholayar dam in Tamil Nadu and Nagarjuna Sagar dam \u2014 straddling the border between Nalgonda District in Telangana and Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh \u2014 have also run out of live storage. Water can be discharged from reservoirs for use till they have live storage. According to the CWC data till June 13, the six state dams without live storage are Yeldari in Parbhani district, Ujjani in Solapur district, Jayakwadi in Aurangabad, Upper Tapi in Jalgaon, Pench in Nagpur and Isapur in Hingoli, Yavatmal, Nanded. Maharashtra is currently the only state after Andhra Pradesh that has recorded the highest plunge in its reservoir storage in comparison to the live capacity till now. A CWC official told TOI that no live storage in reservoirs means only dead water storage was available in them. \u201cThere are eight such reservoirs in the country among the 91 major reservoirs monitored by us. A majority of them are in Maharashtra. The drought-like situation last year in Maharashtra and delayed monsoon this time have caused water levels to dip considerably in dams, leaving only dead storage in some. Whatever little rainfall the state has been receiving has been in scattered locations, which has not helped in filling the dams,\u201d the official said. He said other states might be currently better off than Maharashtra because they might not be using dam water to that extent or received better rainfall. A water resource department official said the live storage in dams was taken for water planning throughout the year. \u201cThe dead storage is not considered in this planning but still, that water is available in dams and can be used if need be. A major demand and allocation of live storage water is for irrigation (75%), while 10-15% of it is allocated for industrial and domestic uses. For domestic usage, enough water is still available in the dead storage in dams,\u201d he said. On the maximum number of dams in Maharashtra reporting 0% live storage, the official said the state had more dams in comparison to others states and so the number of dams with only dead storage was more here. An official from the water resources department in Aurangabad said in the case of Jayakwadi dam, drinking and industry water needs were currently being met by means of using the reservoir\u2019s dead storage.

The probe agency, in its remand report submitted to the court, cited documents/information recovered from Punalekar\u2019s laptops, including an incriminating letter that mentions the court proceedings in the Nalasopara explosives case and some observations about the judge; efforts to rope in eight to 10 advocates for Sanatan Sanstha\u2019s work and about a person called \u201cSadguru\u201d. \u201cIt is suspected that the higher level person is based at Goa and therefore accused Sanjiv Punalekar may be taken to some places, including Goa, to confront with various persons,\u201d the report stated. Special prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi told the court that the CBI wanted to confront Punalekar with fresh information, including establishing the \u201cSadguru\u2019s\u201d identity. His interrogation was needed in relation to a folder named \u201cDabholkar\u201d found on his laptops, the prosecutor said and referred to a mail Punalekar had sent Dabholkar in 2012 opposing the latter\u2019s anti-superstition campaign activity. \u201cThe UAPA has a proviso that enables the investigating officer to secure custodial remand of an accused who has been sent to judicial custody,\u201d Suryavanshi said, citing Section 43D (2) (a) of the special enactment. The probe agency further has a right to secure total 30 days of custodial remand, he added. Special UAPA judge R M Pande ordered Punalekar\u2019s remand in CBI custody till June 23. While a full text of the order was likely to be released late in the evening or on Friday morning, the judge orally informed Suryavanshi and lawyer Virendra Ichalkaranjikar, who is representing Punalekar, that he was granting custodial remand till 11am on June 23, when the accused should be produced before the court. Ichalkaranjikar argued that the court ought to dismiss the CBI\u2019s remand plea without even going into the merits of the matter as the plea was devoid of the legal requirements under UAPA. He said the UAPA court had on June 4 rejected the CBI\u2019s plea for a 15-day custodial remand of Punalekar and his assistant. \u201cQuestion arises that whether the court can now re-consider or review its own order by allowing the CBI\u2019s fresh remand plea after the accused have been sent to judicial custody. There is no such provision under the UAPA,\u201d he said. Ichalkaranjikar submitted that the CBI could not seek custodial remand merely on the basis of some conjectures, but ought to have filed an affidavit as per the UAPA provisions.

Based on an increase in rainfall in parts of the state, officials at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) told TOI on Wednesday that the much-awaited rainy season could start in Pune and Mumbai on June 23. The onset dates of monsoon over Pune and Mumbai are June 10 and 11, respectively. There was no further progress of monsoon on Wednesday, but the Met department said conditions were becoming favourable for further advance of the southwest monsoon into some more parts of central Arabian Sea, Karnataka, some parts of south Konkan and Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, remaining parts of Tamil Nadu, some more parts of Bay of Bengal, remaining parts of northeast India, some parts of Gangetic West Bengal, Sikkim, parts of Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha during the next two or three days. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, said though the monsoon onset conditions over Mumbai seemed favourable for the past few days, something similar could not be said about Pune. \"The westerly wind flow, a characteristic of monsoon, has started in parts of the state but the amount, spread and intensity of rain in Maharashtra is less than required to declare the onset. Also, the onset criteria require fairly widespread to widespread rain as well as heavy rain in isolated places of a region, which is not happening currently but may be fulfilled around June 23 for both Mumbai and Pune, simultaneously,\" he said. Kashyapi said the conditions on June 19 and 20 might not seem favourable for the monsoon onset over parts of the areas adjacent to southern Maharashtra with mostly just overcast skies but poor rainfall. \"We see ideal conditions around June 21 for monsoon onset over south Konkan and Goa,\" he said. As far as Pune is concerned, Kashyapi said the city was likely to record light rain and have mostly cloudy skies till June 22. \"From June 22- 23, our forecast indicates increasing likelihood of light to moderate rain in spells in Pune. Hence, monsoon may make an onset over Pune around that time,\" he said. Kashyapi said monsoon was likely to make a simultaneous onset over Mumbai and Pune. Though Mumbai is fulfilling onset criteria to an extent, we cannot declare onset over south Konkan and Mumbai simultaneously because there is a huge aerial difference between the two. After the onset over south Konkan, monsoon is likely to take another two days to reach Mumbai,\" he said.

The central agency said it raided the factory and residential premises of Varron Aluminium Private Limited (VAPL) and Varron Auto Comp Private Limited (VACL) in Pune, Ratnagiri, Sangli and Nagpur in a case in which the Bank of India (BoI) was cheated by alleged misuse of the Letters of Credit (LC) facility. An LC denotes an official letter issued by a bank to another bank to serve as a guarantee for payments made to a specified person under specified conditions. The searches were carried out after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), based on an FIR lodged by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The BoI was the complainant in the case, the ED said. The agency, in a statement, said VAPL maintained a current bank account with the Karve Road branch of the BoI in Pune and that the firm \"submitted LCs and bills drawn from a Canara Bank branch in the same city, which were negotiated or discounted\" in favour of the BoI. \"The bills were discounted by the BoI after the verification of the LC and acceptance of all the bills by the authorised officials of Canara Bank (Deccan Gymkhana, Pune branch) and the aggregate amount of Rs 293 crore was credited to the account of VAPL,\" it said. Later, when the BoI approached the Canara Bank for re-payment of dues, the latter informed that \"the purported LC was neither issued nor bills were accepted by their branch through the approved mode of Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS) and thus, they did not entertain the repayment request of the BoI, the ED alleged. \"This resulted in a loss to the Bank of India,\" the agency said. It said Shrikant Pandhurang Sawaikar, the director and the main man behind VAPL, along with Canara Bank officials and other private individuals, \"entered into a criminal conspiracy to cheat the BoI\". \"In pursuance to the said criminal conspiracy, a non-genuine LC, commercial invoices and lorry receipts were used for the release of Rs 293 crore in the account of VAPL,\" the ED said, adding that it resulted in a fraud and the bank suffering losses. The agency said its probe, so far, had revealed that the said money \"was immediately transferred through various accounts and finally utilised for settling old dues and making fixed deposits\" by the accused. Further investigation to establish the money trail and attachment of assets was under progress, it added.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The CBI pleaded that it wanted to confront Punalekar with a fresh set of evidence, including documents recovered from his seized laptops and the call data record of his cellphone. Special UAPA judge R M Pande posted the matter for a hearing on Thursday after asking the defence lawyers to make their written submission on the CBI\u2019s remand plea. The CBI\u2019s plea comes at a time when arguments over the bail pleas of Punalekar and his assistant, Vikram Bhave, were nearing completion. Special public prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi was to conclude his arguments. The arguments are now on hold. Suryavanshi told TOI, \u201cThe CBI has retrieved the data from the two laptops seized from Punalekar\u2019s office following his arrest. The CBI wants his presence in custody for further investigation in relation to this data.\u201d He added, \u201cThey also want to probe him in relation to the call data record and this was the reason it moved a remand plea. The bail proceeding will now be taken up after the remand matter is settled.\u201d Lawyer Virendra Ichalkaranji, representing Punalekar, said, \u201cWe feel the CBI\u2019s remand plea is nothing more than a tactic to prolong the matter.\u201d The CBI arrested Punalekar and Bhave on May 25 for allegedly instructing destruction of firearms used in the murders of Dabholkar in Pune on August 20, 2013, and Gauri Lankesh in Bengaluru on September 5, 2017, and aiding the two shooters in a recce, respectively. It is the probe agency\u2019s case that Sharad Kalaskar, one of the two men accused of shooting at Dabholkar, said in a statement recorded before a Karnataka magistrate on October 12, 2018, that Punalekar had told him in June 2018 to destroy the firearms used in the two murder cases. Kalaskar acted on the instruction by dismantling and throwing four firearms into a water body from the bridge at the Thane creek on July 23, 2018. Bhave is accused of accompanying Kalaskar and the other alleged shooter, Sachin Andure, for a recce on Dabholkar\u2019s routine and the escape route, the agency claimed. A Pune court had ordered the duo\u2019s remand in CBI custody till June 1, when the probe agency told the court that it had applied charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which entitled them for a total 30-day custodial remand. The court extended the remand till June 4 and ordered the duo\u2019s remand in judicial custody. They were sent to the Yerawada central jail.
