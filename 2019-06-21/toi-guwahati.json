The Union home ministry, in a gazette notification of May 30, said an applicant shall provide a certified copy of the rejection order received from the NRC authorities along with the grounds for appeal. However, the notification added that persons against whom the foreigners tribunals have 'already given opinion' earlier as foreigner will not be eligible to file appeals. Also, persons against whom 'reference' has already been made by the competent authority to any FT shall not be eligible to file appeals before the tribunal, the notification said. \"The appellant may appear either in person or through a legal practitioner or a relation authorized by the appellant in writing, subject to the acceptance of such representation by the tribunal,\" the notification said. It added that the tribunal shall issue a notice to the district magistrate to produce NRC records within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice and a copy of the notice shall also be sent to the pleader appearing for the government and also the appellant. The state government may appoint a pleader to represent the district magistrate. The notification said the district magistrate 'may also refer to the tribunal' for its opinion on whether the appellant is a foreigner or not. \"Upon production of records, if the tribunal finds merit in the appeal, it shall issue notice to the appellant and the district magistrate for hearing, specifying the date of hearing and such date shall be within thirty days from the date of production of the records,\" the notification said. It added that the final order of the tribunal shall contain its opinion on whether the appellant is eligible for inclusion in the NRC or not. The All Assam Minority Students' Union (AAMSU), one of the stakeholders in the NRC case in the Supreme Court, said the central government issued the gazette notification without holding any consultations with the stakeholders. \"Had there been consultation with the stakeholders prior to the issuance of gazette notification, we would have given our inputs for necessary amendments. We will soon meet chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, as well as the Union home secretary, with our demands,\" said Aamsu adviser Azizur Rahman. The names of 40.07 lakh people were excluded from the final draft NRC that was released on July 30 last year. Those who have been exluded include 'declared foreigners', doubtful 'D' voters and their family members. However, over 30 lakh people of 40.07 lakh have filed claims for inclusion in the final NRC. There are an estimated 1,19,559 'D' voters in the state.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Unbearably hot and humid conditions have been prevailing in the region since June 1. On Wednesday, the capital experienced scorching heat with the temperature shooting up to 37 degrees Celsius, the highest in the northeast. North Lakhimpur recorded a maximum temperature of 36.2 degree Celsius during the day followed by Silchar and Dhubri-35.7 and 35.2 degree Celsius respectively. While Agartala recorded a maximum temperature of 36.8 degree Celsius, the rising temperature inched up to 35 degree Celsius in Itanagar. Met officials said the maximum temperature in northeastern towns and cities was 3 to 5 degrees above normal on Wednesday. \"A low pressure area is likely to develop over the north Bay of Bengal and its neighbouring areas in the next two to three days. As a result, less moisture is being carried from the Bay of Bengal to the northeast, causing the unusual heat. Besides, there is less cloud formation causing direct sunshine on the earth's surface,\" said a senior official at the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) in Guwahati. What is, however, more worrying is the deficit rainfall the northeastern states have experienced since June 1, when the monsoon season begins climatologically. RMC data stated that at 65% deficit, Manipur recorded the highest deficit from June 1 to 18. This was followed by 46% deficit in Assam and 37% deficit in Mizoram. The shortage of rainfall in other states of the region are-Arunachal Pradesh 36%, Meghalaya 35%, Tripura 27% and Nagaland 14%. In contrast, in the initial days of the monsoon season in NE, Meghalaya received the highest rainfall of 289.1 mm, followed by Tripura at 225.8 mm. But both were not adequate. While Arunachal Pradesh recorded 172.5 mm rainfall, Mizoram and Assam experienced 157.7 mm and 134.1 mm respectively. It was followed by Nagaland (131.9 mm) and Manipur (90.6 mm). Met officials, however, said that in the next 48 to 72 hours, rainfall activity may enhance as conditions are becoming favourable for further advancement of the Southwest monsoon into the remaining parts of the northeast and cover the entire region in the next 2-3 days.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

Now, a similar campaign is underway in Assam, with contractual government school teachers prefixing \u2018Driver\u2019 to their names on social media. A recent remark by the education minister Siddhartha Bhattacharya, which led to the move, will now witness more protests, with hundreds of TET-qualified teachers announcing agitations across the district headquarters on Tuesday to condemn the minister\u2019s statement and demand regularization of jobs of contractual teachers. Bhattacharya, while talking to mediapersons on Thursday, had said that TET teachers, who got their teaching certificates more than five years ago, need to have their documents renewed, just like driving licenses. The backlash was swift, with thousands of TET-qualified teachers, who have long been demanding regularization of jobs and are staring at an uncertain future, adding the prefix \u2018Driver\u2019 to their profile names on social media. \u201cThe education minister has demeaned the qualification certificates of the TET teachers by comparing them with driving licenses.

Regularization of jobs of around 40,000 of these teachers was a poll promise of BJP ahead of the 2016 assembly election.

The test was last held in Assam in 2014, with 90,043 candidates having cleared the examination. Around 40,000 TET-qualified teachers are working on a contractual basis in the state now, with the government\u2019s decision to hold the test again in September this year having raised concerns among those instructors who have previously cleared the examination but are still awaiting regularization. Working president of the organization, Troloikya Deka, has appealed to chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal to regularize the services of the TET-qualified teachers, who have been working on a contractual basis with the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan for years now. The Assam government must fulfil its promise of regularization of jobs of TET-qualified teachers, Deka said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The incident took place at Sewpur tea estate at around 1.30pm on Friday. Locals said Ajay had informed his in-laws and neighbours on June 5 that his wife, Radha Tanti (23), and daughter had gone missing. As the duo remained traceless, Radha's family members, suspecting foul play, reached the couple's home and started searching their place. The shadow of suspicion fell on the in-laws because there used to be frequent domestic quarrels, local residents said. Ajay and Radha were married two years ago. During the search, her family members found Radha's body in a septic tank near the house. The news of the horrific discovery soon spread and hundreds of tea garden workers gathered outside the house. The mob then dragged out Ajay and attacked him, accusing him of killing his wife and daughter. His mother Jamuna was also not spared as the mob attacked the duo with bamboo splinters and rods. Even the police who arrived shortly afterwards did not dare to intervene after seeing the fury of the mob. In a video of the incident, which was taken on a phone camera and has since gone viral on social media, a group of people are seen attacking the mother and the son, who have fallen to the ground. Undetterred, the mob continue to hit them with rods and sticks, even as the police stand by as mute spectators. Later, Jamuna and Ajay were taken to the Tinsukia civil hospital where the former was declared dead on arrival. Her severely injured son was shifted to the Assam Medical College and Hospital in Dibrugarh, where he died on Saturday morning. Police said they have registered an FIR on their own. Tinsukia police station officer in charge Dipak Tamuli said, \"We have registered a case against unknown persons. No one has been arrested so far. We are examining the video clip and trying to trace the couple's two-month-old daughter.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Ex-Armyman, detained as 'foreigner' in Assam, gets bail": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/ex-armyman-detained-as-foreigner-in-assam-gets-bail/articleshow/69698531.cms", "time": "2019-06-08 08:36:00", "description": "GUWAHATI: The Gauhati high court on Friday granted conditional interim bail to former armyman Mohammad Sanaullah, who was sent to a detention camp on May 28 after a Foreigners' Tribunal in Assam declared him as an 'illegal foreigner' .  The bench of Justices Manojit Bhuyan and Prasanta Kumar Deka ordered that Sanaullah, 52, be released on bail after furnishing a bail bond of Rs 20,000 with two local sureties. The court directed him not to move out of the territorial limits of Kamrup district without the prior approval of superintendent of police. The bench has also directed the authorities to obtain the biometrics of Sanaullah before releasing him. Challenging the tribunal's order, which he described as 'arbitrary, perverse and illegal', Sanaullah had moved the HC on May 31. He had also filed an interlocutory application, seeking his release from detention.  Sanaullah retired from the Army in 2017 as an honourary lieutenant after which he had joined Assam Police as an assistant sub-inspector.  In September 2018, proceedings against Sanaullah under Foreigners' Act were initiated on the basis of a 2008 report of Assam Border Police, the same wing of Assam Police in which Sanaullah later worked, to the tribunal that he was an 'illegal migrant' .  Border Police officer Chandramal Das, who had inquired and reported that Sanaullah was an illegal foreigner, had mentioned his profession as 'labourer' in the 2008 report.  It also incorporated a purported 'confessional statement' of Sanaullah that he had illegally entered India 'through a secret route' for better living. The inquiry officer has also mentioned in his report that Sanaullah's wife and his two children were 'suspected nationals'. But Sanaullah, in his petition, submitted that the tribunal's order did not mention that he had served in the Indian Army from 1987 to 2017. He further stated that no inquiry officer visited his house and that no notice had ever been served on him. He maintained that the inquiry report was completely false and fabricated. The high court has issued notices to the Centre, state government, NRC authorities, defence ministry and Assam Border Police to respond to the petition within four weeks. Chandramal Das has been added as a respondent in his personal capacity.Senior Supreme Court advocate Indira Jaising, assisted by high court advocates HRA Choudhury, PK Deka, Aman Wadud and Syed Burhanur Rehman, appeared for Sanaullah on Friday.

The field study was conducted between July 2017 and February 2018. The report's socioeconomic survey section said that all the 46 people who were asked with the several questionnaires on the proposed project were categorically against construction of the dam. \"All of them who were interviewed were aware of the construction of the dam. Not a single person agreed to the construction of the dam. This is because the dam will nearly submerge a large part of the area, including settlements of the people and 13th century stupa, the Gorzam Chorten, which has great cultural and historical significance,\" the report released late last month said. Zemithang valley in Tawang district has a population of 2,805 in 12 villages. Buddhist Monpas are the predominant community in the district. The Monpas also in West Kameng district of the state reveres black-necked cranes that breed in Ladakh and China as an embodiment of the sixth Dalai Lama who was born in 1683 in Tawang that borders with China's Tibet. The locals who call the bird as Trung-Trung Karmo, considers the arrival of black-necked cranes as norbu (good fortune). Further, the report said people interviewed were aware of the fact that hunting was not allowed in the Black-necked cranes' wintering habitat due to the \"local religious belief\" of the Monpas. \"Only a few of the people had heard about one death, which had been caused by some outsiders,\" the report said. The three kilometer stretch of Nyamjang Chhu (river in Monpa language) between Brojenthang and Zemithang in the valley is one of the two wintering sites of black-necked cranes in India. The other site is Sangti, also in Arunachal Pradesh. The wintering site in Nyamjang Chhu also overlapped with the barrage for the proposed 780 MW hydro-electric project. WII's report has categorically said that the construction of the dam would \"eventually submerge the entire habitat of vulnerable black-necked crane in Zemithang.\" It said that the sample group consisted of young to middle-aged people \"who have been observing the cranes only from the recent past.\" \"But a few of the elders had answered about their (Black-necked cranes) presence from the early 20th century. This shows that the area has been used by Black-necked cranes as a critical wintering site for a very long period of time,\" the report said. Monks who under the banner of Save Mon Region Federation (SMRF) has been protesting against Nyamjang Chhu and 12 other hydro-electric projects in Tawang took the WII's report as a \"moral victory\" of their movement. The WII report is an outcome of a 2016 order by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that suspended the environmental clearance given to the project and asked the environment ministry to conduct a study on the environmental impact of the project. In 2012 SMRF challenged in NGT the environmental clearance granted to Nyamjang Chhu on the ground that the project developer did not reveal the wintering site of black-necked crane in the environment impact assessment (EIA) report commissioned by the project developer.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

Assam, which was once rich in freshwater turtles, but habitat loss and over-exploitation - they were once a popular local food - have massively depleted their population. The black softshell turtle was declared extinct in the wild in 2002 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while the Indian softshell turtle and the Indian peacock softshell turtle are classified as vulnerable. But all the while, the pond of the Hayagriva Madhav temple in the Hajo pilgrimage centre has provided a safe haven to them, thanks to the sacred status of turtles protecting them from harm. \"There are plenty of turtles in the temple pond,\" said Jayaditya Purkayastha, from conservation group 'Good Earth'. The group has teamed up with the temple authorities in a breeding programme. \"The population of the turtle in Assam has gone down by a great extent. So we thought we needed to intervene and do something to save the species from extinction,\" he said. In January, his organisation's first batch of 35 turtle hatchlings, including 16 black softshells hand-reared at the temple, was released into a nearby wildlife sanctuary. A key figure is the caretaker of the temple pond, Pranab Malakar, who long before environmentalists became involved took a keen interest in the turtles' wellbeing. \"I used to take care of them as I like them. Later, after I became associated with Good Earth, it became my responsibility,\" he said. \"No one harms them here as they are incarnations of Lord Vishnu (a Hindu deity). I was born and grew up here. We have been seeing the turtles since our childhood. People respect them,\" he said. Malakar collects eggs laid by the turtles on the sandy banks of the pond - a new concrete bank had to be demolished a few years ago - and gingerly puts them into an incubator. The project has been so successful that Good Earth has identified 18 other temple ponds in the area which could also be used for similar initiatives. But it is not without its challenges. For one thing, some of the hundreds of daily visitors to the temple outside Guwahati throw bread and other food to the turtles - which they clearly like. \"This has triggered some biological changes among the turtles in the pond. They have also lost their natural tendency of hunting for food,\" Purkayastha said.

A top state police official said, \"There are hundreds of domesticated jumbos in the state and many of them have their tusks intact. Usually, the forest department keeps a track of these animals, but in many cases, owners sell off tusks for money.\" Sources added that despite the department seizing tusks of domesticated elephants after their deaths as a precautionary measure, there were allegations that many owners did not inform the department about the deaths of their elephants and sold off the tusks. \"About a third of the length of the tusk lies inside the elephant's skull, which is why ivory hunters kill the elephant instead of just cutting off the tusk. There were reports that sometimes procedures of tusk seizures were also not followed carefully and portions of the tusk were left in the body enabling illegal traders to have their fill,\" said sources.

The courses are likely to start from the 2020-21 academic year. \"We have approved integrated BEd courses in general degree colleges for the first time. Now, the colleges which have received the nod will have to complete the formalities to start the courses,\" director of higher education Gitimoni Phukan said. Currently, the BEd course can only be pursued after graduation and are available mostly in teachers' training colleges and District Institute of Education and Training in various districts. With the new integrated courses, which spans for four years, an aspirant can opt for it right after completing their higher secondary education. \"The introduction of the new course will help students get dual degrees in four years. Those planning to become teachers can enroll into the integrated BSc-BEd and BA-BEd programmes after completing class XII,\" said Nirada Devi, director of the State Council of Educational Research and Training. A Bachelor of Education degree is now compulsory to become a teacher in secondary and higher secondary schools. Officials of the state higher education department, therefore, expect a huge rush of applications once the integrated courses become functional. Sources in the state education department said that at present, there are 4000 BEd seats in different government and private institutes around the state but they are only for those who have completed their graduation. The 68 colleges that received the approval to introduce the integrated BEd courses are in Baksa, Barpeta, Biswanath, Bongaigaon, Charaideo, Chirang, Darrang, Dhemaji, Dhubri, Dibrugarh, Karbi Anglong, Goalpara, Golaghat, Hojai, Jorhat, Kamrup (Metro), Kamrup, Kokrajhar, Lakhimpur, Majuli, Morigaon, Nagaon, Nalbari, Sivasagar, Sonitpur, Tinsukia and Udalguri districts of Assam.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The protests at AMC are being held under the banner of the Junior Doctors' Association, Assam Medical College Students' Association, the Dibrugarh branch of Indian Medical Association and Assam Medical College Teachers' Association. AMC has decided to participate in the nationwide 24-hour strike called by the Indian Medical Association on June 17. Except for emergency services which have been exempted from the strike, non-emergency services and routine diagnostic services will remain suspended during the period, AMC sources said on Saturday. \"Like West Bengal, medical colleges in Assam lack proper safety measures. The basic minimum we can ask for is the permanent placement of security personnel at places which have a high patient turnover, like casualty departments. Security is of utmost importance for doctors to avoid taking risks or even trying invasive life-saving procedures for fear of physical assault if such procedures lead to complications,\" said Sauradeep Dey, a junior resident doctor at the department of general surgery at AMC. \"We hope that the Kolkata incident will pave the way for proper screening measures such as preventing drunk or rowdy attendants from entering the patient management zone and quick redressal of grievances of patients and their attendants by additional hospital personnels. On-duty doctors, overburdened with looking after patients, often fail to provide fast solutions to these grievances, leading to miscommunication between patients and their families,\" a junior doctor said.

Holding placards and shouting slogans, over 40,000 contractual teachers joined in the protest, demanding regularization of their jobs and threatening to launch a 'Dispur Gherao' on June 29. Bhattacharya, during a phone-in programme hosted by the All India Radio last Thursday, had said that TET teachers, who got their teaching certificates more than five years ago, need to have their documents renewed, just like driving licenses. The remark had led to strong protests, with thousands of TET-qualified teachers adding the prefix 'Driver' to their profile names on social media. \"We have given a 10-day ultimatum to chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal to consider our demand of regularizing the services of all 40,000 teachers, who were engaged as contractual instructors under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in a phase-wise manner. If no step is taken to unconditionally regularize our services with pay protection, then all the contractual, TET-qualified teachers of Assam will launch a Dispur Gherao protest on June 29,\" said Troloikya Deka, working president of Sodou Asom Prathamik TET Uttirna Sikhyak Samaj, a coordination committee of TET-qualified primary teachers which is leading the statewide protest. The representatives of the organization sent memoranda to Sonowal through their respective deputy commissioners, calling for regularization of jobs of all the contractual teachers. Condemning Bhattacharya's remark, the organization, in an earlier statement, had said, \"The education minister has demeaned the qualification certificates of the TET teachers by comparing them with driving licenses. If Bhattacharyya cannot give due respect to the teachers, this will destroy the education sector. He has failed in carrying out his responsibilities.\" Over 40,000 TET-qualified teachers are working on a contractual basis in the state now. Regularization of their jobs was one of the primary poll promises of BJP ahead of the 2016 assembly polls. The protesting teachers also said on Tuesday that they are unwilling to sit for the TET once again. The exam will be held again in September this year, with the decision having raised concerns among the instructors who have already qualified TET but are still working on a contractual basis. TET was last held in Assam in 2014, with 90,043 candidates having cleared the examination. It was held for the first time in Assam in 2012. A total of 52,772 candidates had cleared the test that year, with 26,100 of them granted employment in a phased manner. At the elementary level, TET certificates are valid for seven years as per National Council for Teacher Education guidelines. But, the 40,000-odd contractual teachers, 80% of whom had qualified TET in 2012, are worried over their dwindling prospects of job regularization after the validity of their TET certificates ended in March this year. Without a valid TET certificate, the contractual teachers will not be eligible to apply for regular teaching jobs, unless the government makes a special consideration for them. The All Assam Students' Union (Aasu) has, meanwhile, also sought an apology from the education minister for his recent remark. Aasu chief Samujjal Bhattacharyya said, \"The TET-qualified teachers have been dedicatedly teaching students for so many years. Many demeaning remarks against them is totally unacceptable.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Natasa Stankovic": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/natasa-stankovic-raises-the-temperature-on-the-beach/videoshow/69884888.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "TNEA Rank List 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/tnea-2019-rank-list-to-be-released-today-tneaonline-in/articleshow/69868592.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Lesser known facts about Gurmeet Choudhary": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/lesser-known-facts-about-gurmeet-choudhary/photostory/65672397.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "H1B Visa news": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-has-no-plans-to-cap-h-1b-work-visa-programme-state-department/articleshow/69883297.cms", "time": "", "description": "WASHINGTON: The Trump administration has no plans to cap H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally, the state department said on Thursday.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The state government had notified the increase in July 2016, but had not implemented it all this while because of the stiff opposition the move has met. The traders, meanwhile, think the unwillingness to withdraw the notification means the government is not considering it as a move at all. \"A force within the state government doesn't want a solution of the traders' grievances. It's a big racket,\" said Prantosh Roy, chief convener of the All Assam Traders' Association (Aata). He added that the license has to be renewed every year in Assam, which is 'harsh' if compared with other states. \"If we compare the charges for renewal of labour registration license in Assam and those with several other states in the country, it's clear that the Assam government has done a discrimination with the traders. Majority of the traders in the state are small and medium, who can not afford to pay such high rates at one go,\" Roy further said. Over 100 traders staged a protest in front of the labour commissioner's office here on Tuesday and submitted a memorandum to the state labour commissioner here, seeking a rollback of the renewal fees or face state-wide strike. Aata, which claims to have support of over five lakh traders from different parts of Assam, urged the labour commissioner to safeguard the interests of the small and medium scale traders for whom they said the 10-fold hike has been a 'big assault'. A delegation of the Aata had met chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal on May 18, demanding that the government withdraw the hike, but Roy said the chief minister's assurance to look into the traders' grievances with 'sympathetic consideration' is yet to yield fruitful results. Blaming the previous Congress-led state government for mulling the hike, Roy said the present BJP-led government has done a blunder by giving a nod to the \"unilateral decision\" of implementing the hike without taking the shopkeepers and traders into confidence. The All Guwahati Traders' Association (AGTA) too has threatened to launch stir against the hike, if the state government do not invite the traders to the discussion table soon. Roy alleged that for years, the traders in the city have not got due benefits from the labour department, even after paying registration and renewal fees to the government.

The operations were launched following chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal's direction to Assam Police chief Kuladhr Saikia to take action against illegal syndicates in the state. Raunak Ali Hazarika, Assam Police's Deputy Inspector General (Western Range), told TOI, \"In the joint operation of Dhubri and South Salmara-Mankachar Police, several pre-dawn raids were conducted at various locations of both the districts simultaneously against known cattle smugglers and their associates.

The recovery of the iron fence cutting tools from the cattle smugglers' possession indicated the latest modus operandi of these smugglers. \"They (cattle smugglers) have admitted to using these tools to cut the barbwires in the international borders to push their cattle to the other side,\" said a police source. He added that these smugglers were waiting for rainy nights to smuggle the cattle. Meanwhile, city police, too, nabbed at least four cattle smugglers in a separate operation. From digging tunnels under the border fences to pushing the cattle through riverine areas, the smugglers are known for adopting various methods. The international cattle smuggling rackets were found to have gone hyperactive recently with the growing demand in Bangladesh during the Ramzan festivities. Earlier, some 12 cattle smugglers were apprehended and some 138 cattleheads seized by the BSF in separate operations in May. On Wednesday, during the Director General level meeting of the BSF and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) at Dhaka in Bangladesh, the issue of smuggling of cattle was discussed.

He, however, was quick to clarify that he is not endorsing the RSS ideology though. \"Let me make it clear that I am dead against the RSS ideology. What I am saying is that we should only look into how RSS could expand its activities through a network of socio-cultural organizations and develop mass contact among people. We know how RSS pracharaks stay in villages and develop close ties with them. So, what is the harm if we, in Congress, also embark on on a similar exercise sans the RSS ideology?\" Gogoi said at a press conference here. He added that one of the reasons for Congress's defeat is its weakening mass contact. \"We were in power for three terms. This made us think that we are invincible. Now that we are routed, we should take it as an opportunity to find out our mistakes, rectify them and start working with full energy,\" said the former chief minister. Countering BJP's Mission 100, Congress on Saturday announced Mission 80, targeting to win 80 out of 126 assembly seats in 2021 assembly polls. During its extended executive meeting presided over by the party in-charge for Assam and former Uttarakhand CM, Harish Rawat, Congress said it has pulled up its socks for the assembly polls by reaching out to people at the grassroots and exposing the failures of the BJP-led coalition government in the state. \"We have to accomplish our Mission 80. For making it happen, we all have to work on mission mode. So, we need a robust mass contact exercise which the RSS has. I will be at the forefront of this campaign,\" Gogoi said. Ruling out that dissidence within Congress after the party poor show in the Lok Sabha polls would hamper the Grand Old Party's prospects in future, Gogoi said the party has thousands of dedicated workers against a handful of rebels. On Saturday, Congress had suspended its general secretary Ramen Borthakur for seeking ouster of incumbent party president Ripun Bora following the party's debacle in the Lok Sabha polls.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa.

At 90.66, chemistry recorded highest cutoff percentage in the general category at CU, followed by physics and zoology, where the cutoffs stood at 89.33% and 87.66% respectively. While the cutoff stood at 87.33% in mathematics major, it was 85.33% in botany. Altogether 485 seats in BSc major courses were filled up during the two-day-long marathon admissions at the CU here that began on Tuesday morning. Admission to BA major courses will be held at the leading state university on Thursday and Friday. On the other hand, B Borooah College, a leading city college, concluded its two-day-long BA admission on Wednesday. In the day shift admission for BA courses held at B Borooah College on Tuesday, the cutoff was 85% for the general category students. On Wednesday, admission was held for afternoon shift BA courses in the college, where the cutoff came down to 80.5 percent for general category students. B Borooah College principal Satyendra Nath Barman said based on preference and merit of the students, the allotment of major courses for various subjects will be done at a later stage. Cotton University academic registrar Sanjay Dutta said advancing the admission schedule in the university this year has led to a marginal rise in cutoffs, which was evident during the admissions held over the last two days. \"This year, Cotton University admission was held much earlier compared to the previous years. As a result, many students who may have been eyeing seats in Delhi University-affiliated colleges have taken admission here as there is no assurance of seats in the leading colleges of Delhi. We believe that this is a factor behind the rise in cut-offs on an average,\" he said. Traditionally, chemistry and Physics have recorded high cut-off scores in Cotton University. Around 4,800 students applied for various BSc and BA major courses in Cotton University this year. For the BSc programmes, the university received about 1900 applications. Now, all eyes are on two-day BA major admissions that is scheduled to begin at CU from Thursday to fill up 470 seats in various undergraduate courses in arts.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that heavy rain is very likely to occur at isolated places over Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura from Tuesday morning. The arrival of the monsoon in the region is likely to cause heavy rain in isolated places in Assam and Meghalaya from Wednesday onwards, the forecast said. Officials at the Guwahati-based Regional Meteorological Centre of the IMD said the advancement of the monsoon towards Assam may be delayed by a couple of days. Several areas in Assam have been reeling from hot and humid conditions over the last one week. But moderate rain, accompanied by thunder-showers is very likely to occur at many places over Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on Tuesday.

Climatologically, monsoon arrives in some parts of northeast on June 1 and covers the entire region by June 5. But this year, the arrival was delayed by about 10 days.
