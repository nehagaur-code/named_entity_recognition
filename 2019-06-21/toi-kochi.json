Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Therefore, the government must rise to the occasion and offer all support, justice Devan Ramachandran said in an order. Highlighting the need for giving publicity to schemes that can be availed by citizens in distress, the court said in an order, \u201cThe information regarding these avenues are generally not available to the citizens at large and I am certain that many of them are, therefore, constrained to go public with their distress to seek the beneficence of fellow citizens and other non-governmental agencies. If the State has such mechanisms, under which citizens can obtain immediate reliefs in such situations, I am certain that this information should be made available to the public at large, including the mode and manner in which they can apply for it, so that litigations of this nature would become unnecessary.\u201d The court considered a petition (WP-C No. 39223/2019) filed by 56-year-old Alavi Kunhalan of Kavarakundu in Malappuram. He had availed a loan of Rs16 lakhs from Malappuram District Cooperative Bank Ltd and defaulted in repayment due to extreme financial crisis.

Approaching the high court, he had sought to put coercive action by the bank on hold and to allow him to repay the loan in instalments.

The petition (WP-C No. 16711/2019) was filed by Ranjit Karthikeyan of Vanchiyoor in Thiruvananthapuram, who is a chartered accountant, by alleging that the steps taken for issuing the bonds under Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Act of 1999 violates Article 293(1), which stipulates that state governments are allowed to borrow only within the country. A counsel representing the petitioner sought to withdraw the petition after a division bench comprising chief justice Hrishikesh Roy and justice AK Jayasankaran Nambiar pointed out that the investment is being canvassed not by the state government but by Kerala Infrastructure Investment Board (KIIB). The petitioner has no case that security offered is against the consolidated fund of the state, the court said. While withdrawing the plea, the counsel also sought permission to file a fresh one, if so advised, after collecting necessary information. While dismissing the case as not pressed, the court has reserved the liberty of the petitioner to approach the court again. It was contended by the petitioner that KIIB is a statutory body and a \u2018State\u2019 and is therefore bound by Article 293(1). A plain reading of the article makes it clear that KIIB violated it by issuing rupee-denominated bonds to overseas investors. Executive power of the state extends to borrowings only within India and borrowing from overseas investors, even in rupee-denominated bonds, has not been envisaged or provided for by the Constitution, the petition had stated. Issuing of Masala Bonds to overseas investors is illegal, arbitrary, and unreasonable and violates Article 14 (equality before law), 19 (right to freedom), and 21 (right to life and liberty) of the Constitution, the petitioner had argued while stating that any act of the government must be reasonable and should be towards public interest. The high rate of interest of 9.723% puts a burden on the public exchequer, thus compromising public interest, it was alleged.

To make a quick buck, withdraw money from an ATM using a valid debit card, then slip back a currency note into the machine and then claim refund for the entire amount from the bank. The bank would credit the money into the account, thereby almost doubling the cash in hand. Such a fraud came to light on Wednesday with the arrest of Amin Khan (42) from Alwar in Rajasthan and Riyaju Khan (27) from Palwal in Haryana, following high drama at Mattancherry. They had withdrawn Rs 10,000 from their accounts when they were caught red-handed by officials from SBI, located right next to the ATM kiosk at Kalvathy in Mattancherry, for trying to cover CCTV camera with a piece of paper at 8.53am. They fled on seeing security guards, only to be chased down by residents and guards, who overpowered and handed them over to Mattancherry police. During interrogation, they revealed their modus operandi. \u201cFor instance, if they withdraw Rs 10,000 and five Rs2000 notes are dispensed, they would slip back one currency note back in. They said that some ATMs would \u2018think\u2019 that the entire amount was being taken back,\u201d said Mattancherry CI VS Navas. The accused would call up the bank\u2019s helpline and complain about the debit. As a result, the entire sum would be \u2018refunded\u2019 in their account. Navas said the duo managed 13 such frauds in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Tamil Nadu since June 10. The details are being compiled, said police. Sources said that though the attempt at Kalvathy failed, the accused claim they had executed one such fraud in city. Police said that a bank official had informed that this method was not possible. \u201cThe bank official told us that there is a way to switch off the ATM at the time of dispensation of cash and he suggested that the fraudsters might have used such an option. In this way they could convince the bank that notes were not dispensed owing to a system failure and demand refund,\u201d said Navas, adding that the accused were sticking to their version. A demo with expert technicians will be held to see how exactly the fraud happens, he said. \u201cThe accused claimed that their technique works in the ATMs manufactured by a certain company. We will be interrogating the accused further to know the truth. Anyway, their accounts received money lately,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, a senior banker, on condition of anonymity, said that fraud \u2013 as described by the accused \u2013 could be done. \u201cThis has happened before. At least, some old machines are still prone to this problem. If such a claim is made and fund is not transferred, bank would have to pay a penalty of Rs 100/day.

Therefore, the government must rise to the occasion and offer all support, Justice Devan Ramachandran said in an order. The court in its order said, \u201cThe information regarding these avenues are generally not available to the citizens at large and I am certain that many of them are, therefore, constrained to go public with their distress to seek the beneficence of fellow citizens and other non-governmental agencies.\u201d The court considered a petition by 56-year-old Alavi Kunhalan of Kavarakundu in Malappuram. He had availed a loan of Rs 16 lakh from Malappuram District Cooperative Bank and defaulted in repayment due to extreme financial crisis. One of his two daughters is mentally challenged whereas the other one is suffering from a serious heart condition.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Around 50 cents were recovered through the drive. However, 12 years later, the revenue department doesn't have any detail about the land recovered at an area that has high land value, shows an RTI reply. Not only that, many of the land parcels that were evicted during the drive has been encroached on again. In a reply to an RTI query submitted by T N Prathapan of Thammanam, Ernakulam village officer stated that the details regarding the land parcels which were recovered through an eviction in 2007 were not available at the village office. \u201cAs this office doesn\u2019t have a file system, details regarding the eviction had not been codified and kept in the office,\u201d the reply by the village officer stated. When contacted, the village officer gave the same answer. Following this, Prathapan has filed an appeal before Kanayannoor Tahsildar. In the reply, the taluk officials said that he would get a reply from Ernakulam village office in a couple of days. Ernakulam Vikasana Samathi, a forum for the development of the city, has demanded that the authorities should take measures for protecting the land. \u201cRecently, a cent on MG Road has been sold at Rs 2 crore. At least 50 cents of land had been recovered through the eviction drive in 2007. Given the value of land in the area, assets running into crores of rupees are being alienated,\u201d said K S Dileep Kumar, president, Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi. \u201cThe corporation should construct compound walls for protecting the holdings from encroachment,\u201d he said. In many areas, the evicted areas are being encroached again. \u201cRecently, a shop owner near Jayalakshmi Silks paved concrete tiles on the poramboke, which was seized from encroachers during 2007 drive. They extended the tile pavement in front of their shop to the poramboke land. When we raised an objection, the corporation removed the tiles from the government land. But this is not an isolated incident,\u201d said Dileep Kumar. \u201cA shopping complex has claimed right of way through the land in front of their building. When the corporation tried to recover the land, the building owners moved court,\u201d said Sudha Dileep Kumar, councillor, Kochi Corporation. Once the land parcels are recovered from the encroachers, it can be used for purposes like constructing bus bays. This will avoid traffic snarls as well as accidents.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP.

He issued the order after hearing an appeal filed by office-bearers of the club, challenging the orders issued by the additional tahsildar and Fort Kochi\u2019s subcollector to recover the said land on Warriam Road. In an order issued on February 2, 2010 under Kerala Land Conservancy Act, the additional tahsildar said that the club has occupied puramboke land as per revenue records. Since it exists on encroached land, it should be vacated. The club secured a stay on the order and approached the Ernakulam sub court and filed a revision petition before revenue authorities citing that the land was given by the king of erstwhile kingdom of Kochi. But, nothing went in their favour. Club authorities then approached Fort Kochi subcollector, who is the appellate authority, to challenge the order. But the sub-collector\u2014in his order in April 2018 \u2014 upheld the order of the additional tahsildar. As per the basic tax register and puramboke register, 80.25 cents in the survey number 740/2 of Ernakulam village in Kanayannur taluk is government land and it was encroached by the club, the sub-collector said. Then, the club moved the high court which ordered the district collector to hear the review petition filed by the club and issue an appropriate order. Based on the court order, Safirulla considered the matter and found that the club lacked documents to prove the ownership of the land. The club claimed that the erstwhile kingdom had even granted timber for the construction of the club house. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the order issued by the district collector. So, I don\u2019t want to comment on the issue. The land was given to us by the Maharaja of Kochi and the club began in 1931.

The study on plastic litter along Kerala coast found that single-use plastic posed a threat not just to cities and towns but also the coast. The study report, released in June, covered 59 sample sites in coastal areas of seven districts. It found that single use plastic accounted for 53% of plastic litter on beaches whereas multi-use materials stood next at 22%of the plastic waste in coastal areas. Food & snacks, home/personal care, tobacco products, utilities and plastic waste from medical care activities were considered as single-use plastics, while fishing equipment and plastic waste from construction activities were considered as multi-use plastics. Of the single-use lot, food & snacks is the major contributor of plastic waste, which raises concerns over the quantity of waste left on the beach by visitors. The state\u2019s aggressive campaign for green protocol seems to have had little impact as the number of plastic carry bags stood at 85.54 lakh pieces. The study found that carry bags are finding its way into fragile environmental zones. Lack of bins was another major problem. A senior pollution control board (PCB) official said that solid waste management rules (2016) said that vendors must have bins to collect waste generated from their business and then deposit in storage depots as notified by the local body. \u201cAbsence of bins has been a major problem on beaches in the state. People and vendors just throw the waste around. Plastic never undergoes degradation, it gets broken into nano particles over the years or will be washed up by the sea. This raises far greater concerns as it may enter the food chain,\u201d he said. The study spanning six months was done by a five-member team of Thanal who also prepared litter indices in terms of number and weight of plastic that was found along the coast. It also pointed at a bigger challenge: undesignated plastic, i.e. litter that remained on beach for a long time that is impossible to categorize. Withering of plastics on the beach made it impossible to identify the origin/type/polymer on inspection. \u201cIdentifying the type was a major challenge as it had remained there for so long. This is one of the biggest contributors of plastic litter along Kerala coast,\u201d said Thanal\u2019s deputy programme officer Sujith Surendran, also a member of the team. Every square metre of beach in the state has 10.31g of plastic waste. The team took samples of plastic litter from 59 locations at regular intervals of 10km. At every location, litter was collected between the shoreline and first line of vegetation/built-up land. District-wise litter index was calculated and Malappuram topped the list as most-littered while Alappuzha was the least-littered one. Programme coordinator Thanal Nikhilesh Paliath, who was a member of the study team, said monsoon brought more challenges as unremoved plastic litter would mix with the sea, endangering marine ecosystem. Most sample locations had rural residential settlement and fishing activity which justified the presence of consumer products and fishing-related material in plastic litter. It was also observed that portions of beach \u2013 adjacent to residential dwellings \u2013 had higher concentration of plastic litter. \u201cCoastal belt is a sensitive corridor as characteristics of aquatic ecosystem and land ecosystem merge on this belt. It is absolutely terrible to find that 17 crore plastic pieces pollute such a sensitive corridor,\u201d said NGO\u2019s executive director Jayakumar C. Environmentalists advocate reduction of single-use plastic as key solution. Environmentalist Shibu KN \u2013 who guided the study \u2013said that every stakeholder in coastal zone must take up initiatives for responsible disposal of plastic waste to protect these zones. Jaya DS at University of Kerala\u2019s environmental sciences department said that single-use plastic must be reduced by a proper collection mechanism. \u201cRecently, the fisheries department started an initiative to provide incentives to fishermen who bring back plastic found at sea. Earlier, they would leave it and microplastics could kill fishes and birds. Reducing single-use plastic is the only way ahead,\u201d she said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

This was found in a report obtained through RTI. In this system, a surcharge/additional payment on the plastic item purchased is received and rebate/refund/payback is given when it is returned. For example: part of a drink\u2019s price would be returned when the customer returns the empty bottle. Germany and Denmark already have such a scheme in place and the bottle return rate is 90%. The return reward amount is printed on the bottle, said the committee. The report further said that a returnable deposit can be levied on plastic bags. \u201cThe retailer returns the deposit to whoever returns the bag. The return reward amount is printed on the bag. All retailers who sell plastic bags are obliged to buy back the bags. All retailers that sell bottled drinks (including mineral water) are obliged to buy back empty bottles.

However, environmentalists questioned the practicality of such a system in state. \u201cThis deposit refund system was earlier used during the conduct of events recently in the capital. We are talking about long-term plan and it needs to be seen how much the society warms up to this concept,\u201d said an environmentalist. The committee was jittery about imposing a complete ban considering the enormous investment in the plastic industry. Kerala has 820 units with a capital investment of Rs 145.7 crore, employing 3,800 workers who are engaged in the production of single-use plastic. As per the report, the committee considered economic aspects and job loss from outright ban on single-use plastics. Plastic carry bags, bottles, paper cups and plates, which account for a major share of plastic litter, have investments worth Rs 75 crore and employ nearly 2,000 people. TOI had earlier reported that the committee had submitted a conflicting report on the ban on plastic products. The report showed the committee recommending a ban on just three products: plastic flags, plastic decorative festoons, single-use food plates, cups and tetra packs. The report carried an annexure on suggestions filed by P Kalaiarasan, environmental engineer, department of environment and climate change. It had a dedicated a legal framework to regulate single-use plastic products in state. The government constituted a fivemember technical expert committee to make a list of plastic products that can be brought under the ambit of a complete ban. The convener recommended that 17 products be banned.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai.

The decision is in the wake of more smuggling cases being reported in the division, especially during night time. According to officials, the drive is also expected to strengthen surveillance around schools as the new academic year has begun. \u201cMonsoon season normally witnesses increase in smuggling cases. Smugglers consider it an ideal time as patrolling and vehicle inspections could be affected by the rains. Moreover, the tight security surveillance employed during election season, which reduced crime rate over the past two months, is now over. So, there is a need to boost up patrolling,\u201d Palan said. Vehicle checking and night patrols will be strengthened across the district and the excise department will join hands with railway protection force to conduct search operations in railway stations to monitor passengers and cargo transport. Separate units of striking force will also be deployed round the clock to act in case of any untoward incidents. Moreover, it targets to crack down on medical shops which sell drugs like Nitrazepam and Alprazolam tablets without any authorized medical prescription. This is following the information collected from some of the accused in recent cases who said that some of the medical shops are assisting smugglers. \u201cThe top narcotic secret group of Ernakulam excise division has been gathering intelligence about the drug suppliers in the city and found that ganja and Nitrazepam tablets are easily available for students, especially those studying in higher secondary level. On Tuesday, we arrested one such supplier after the details collected from a high school student, who underwent counselling at the excise Vimukthi counselling centre when his parents found ganja packet in his schoolbag. Drug menace among students is a major challenge that needs to be checked,\u201d said Palan. The official also said that excise officials would be part of parent-teacher meetings in schools in the district. \u201cThe School Protection Groups are already associating with excise to help counsel student and gather information,\u201d Palan said.

The woman from Mannarkkad had complained of sexual harassment against the Shoranur MLA, following which the later was suspended from the party for six months. During the two-day camp of the DYFI on Saturday and Sunday at Elappully, the DYFI district committee was reconstituted by allegedly demoting some of the party members who had supported the woman. The complainant had tendered her resignation following the move on Sunday. T M Sasi, the new district secretary of DYFI, said the issue of resignation would be taken up in the next district committee meet. He added that the reconstitution of the committee was a normal procedure followed in the organization and it was used to promote people on merit and demote those who do not discharge their responsibilities efficiently. The woman\u2019s complaint against the MLA, who is also a secretariat member of the party district committee, was a major embarrassment for the CPM and DYFI and there were differences within the committee as some members supported the woman and demanded stern action against the MLA. The resignation is also said to be in protest against the elevation of a DYFI leader as the district vice-president, who was accused of tarnishing the image of the woman leader through social media. The MLA was suspended for six months from the party on November 26 after an inquiry commission appointed by the party, consisting of minister A Balan and P K Sreemathi found him guilty. As the punishment period was over, the party is learned to be considering to take him back. But the fresh controversy and the humiliating defeat of the Left in the Lok Sabha polls are likely to delay his reinduction.

There has been a sharp fall in the number of tourists this season according to tour operators and owners of houseboats and resorts in Kumarakom. The occupancy of rooms is far below 50%. Hoping for a change in fortune by next month, the stakeholders want the government to take some initiatives to rejuvenate the sector. Salim Das, president of Vembanad Chamber of Hotels and Resorts, said even the weekends are dull and the sector is facing a crisis. Das cited Nipah scare as one of the main reason for the fall in the footfall. \u201cAlong with Nipah fear, the economic depression could also be one reason,\u201d he added. Now people are opting shikara boats to house boats to cut down the cost,\u201d he said. Also, the GST is too high in the country and this is forcing tourists to opt for destinations outside the country, he said. \u201cThe tax which was 12.5% earlier had now risen to 18-28%,\u201d he said. Sreekumar, a tour operator in Kumarakom, said it has been a downward trend in June. \u201cUsually during this time, we used to get a good number of tourists from the metro cities in the country. But now, there has been hardly 50% occupancy in the resorts,\u201d he said. Sreekumar, who was on a trip to Goa to study the sector there, lauded the initiatives of the Goan tourism department which has helped the industry there. \u201cThis season, the Goan tourism department has launched several attractions like hot air balloon ride and bungee jumping. They have also started a mobile app for availing taxi service. There are also casinos in cruise ships,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe are lagging far behind when compared to destinations like Goa. We are only marketing tourism and not taking any initiative to improve,\u201d he said. Shanej Indraprastham, a houseboat owner, said there has been no new bookings for houseboats. \u201cUsually we used to get domestic tourists this month. By July there used to be a good flow of Arab tourists. But there has been no bookings so far,\u201d he said. Indraprastham also said the houseboat industry is facing a crisis as there has been a shortage of staff. After the floods, the industry was dull and many staff left the job and joined other places. We can\u2019t employ migrant workers in houseboats,\u201d he added. There are around 120 houseboats operating in Kumarakom. Biju Varghese, deputy director, tourism department, said the department is doing state-level marketing of the tourism sector. He also hoped that the turnout of tourists will increase this monsoon. \u201cThere was an increase in the number of tourists in the first three months of the year compared to the same period last year,\u201d he said.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life.

She was one of the 87 performers at the alumni event organised by the Old Students Association (OSA) of the Government Women\u2019s College, Thiruvananthapuram. Titled Vasthrayana, the dance drama themed on the evolution of garments in India was a visual treat for those in attendance at the Karthika Tirunal Auditorium, recently. The cultural extravaganza saw performances of three generations of students, from the previous pre-degree batches to the recent graduates. Hundreds of alumni including homemakers, working professionals, artistes and bureaucrats, joined the performers at the venue to take a stroll down memory lane to relive their campus life. While those who had become great grandmothers enjoyed watching the show, many were looking around for their old batchmates. Though time had changed their physical appearance, many still found their pals, by calling out their nicknames. Singer Kanchana Sreeram, BA Music graduate of the 2017 batch, portrayed a South Indian bride on the show and says the event gave her friendship goals. \u201cAt a time when video calls and group chats are the norm, this alumni group stands apart because the reunion is held regularly without fail. I am happy I could see our super seniors and their seniors still joke around like in their younger days. I think they were the most enthusiast bunch at the event,\u201d she says. \u201cI was also surprised to see the performance of Princess Gouri Parvathi Bhayi, who danced flawlessly.\u201d The dance drama narrated the evolution of garments with time \u2014 from the stone age to contemporary dressing styles. The event was held under the guidance of Pooyam Tirunal Gouri Parvathi Bayi, who is the OSA secretary. \u201cThe show is held every two years. The 87 members who were part of this show were of different ages and from all walks of life. We had grandmothers and mothers alongside granddaughters and daughters. It was hard work but fun too. Our dance director Aswathy Nair worked tirelessly to ensure seamless production and Ambili Ramnath\u2019s expertise with words and Kavalam Sreekumar\u2019s magic with the music have always been the mainstay of our performances,\u201d she says. Apart from performing, for Gouri Parvathi Bayi, it is also an event to meet her friends and teachers. \u201cI have never really left the Women\u2019s College - as a student, teacher and as part of the Alumni association, I have always remained in touch with the institution. For most of us, there is a sense of homecoming when we step into the college compound. The years fall away, and we feel rejuvenated. Ultimately in life, our real earnings are the friendships we have forged, the wonderful experiences nobody can take away from us and precious memories that stay with us always. Many of our older members make it a point to come to our meetings and events. They make a greater physical effort than youngsters who work a full day and have homes to run too,\u201d she adds. Actress Sona Nair was also part of the event, enthralling her friends in her avatar as goddess Saraswati. \u201cThis is an event that I eagerly look forward to. I feel blessed meeting my old teachers and classmates, and giving me memories to cherish for the next two years. Each of the 87 artistes were given a three-and-half-minute performance and so that ensured everyone had equal time to perform,\u201d she says, adding that she always makes it a point to find time amid her shooting schedules to make it to the reunion.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Garbage dumped nearby Chinese fishing net.": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/garbagedumpednearbychinesefishingnet-/articleshow/69616202.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "RCB team 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rcb-team-2019-players-list-royal-challengers-bangalore-team-2019/articleshow/67151637.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Where is the footpath?": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/whereisthefootpath3f/articleshow/69718302.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Muvattupuzha-Kaloor chain service launched": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/muvattupuzha-kaloor-chain-service-launched/articleshow/69853502.cms", "time": "2019-06-19 11:46:00", "description": "KOCHI: KSRTC has launched a chain service from its Muvattupuzha depot linking Pattimattam, Kizhakambalam and Kakkanad with Kaloor.

A handful of young fish farmers have embarked on sale of live fish either at their own farms or specific sales points near highways or small towns. Advantages are many: Consumers can get chemical-free fish fresh from the nets and since there are no middlemen, farmers can earn a good revenue. But it can be risky if there are not enough sales because frequent transfer from ponds and life fish sale tanks can stress out the fish. Such sales outlets have come up in areas like Perumbavoor and Kothamangalam, which have lot of inland fish farms. \u201cWe are getting a lot of calls from farmers who want to know whether we can sell their fish,\u201d said Shaji Varghese, a farmer associated with Farmers\u2019 Facilitation Centre, formed under Sanskara, a cultural organization at Kothamangalam. Varghese, who works as a promoter under Fish Farmer Development Agency (FFDA) and owns a farm at Varapettty said the outlet could solve a major issue faced by fish farmers. His live fish sale outlet was recently moved to a plot near Bishop\u2019s House at Kothamangalam in the highway. Encouraged by the prospects, more farmers are joining the bandwagon. Dhanesh, who grows fish at Methala village, has gone one step further and introduced mobile live fish sale to reach out to more customers. \u201cThe response so far was quite good but we should have a minimum sale of 50kg every day if it is to be profitable since I am using a hired vehicle,\u201d said Dhanesh. While there are many takers for live fish, lack of diversity is a problem. Most farmers sell only Gift Tilapia and buyers who look for variety may find it disappointing. Some buyers have an aversion to inland farmed fish because of the feeling that they are less tasty. \u201cThe fish tastes good if it is farmed scientifically with proper feed. But most farmers tend to feed fish with chicken waste because fish feed tends to be costly,\u201d said Renju, who has a farm at Kothamangalam and sells around 40kg of fish every day.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party.

The Congress leader hit out at BJP's strategy of playing the nationalist card. \"We are Congress\u2026 we launched the freedom movement\u2026 gave our blood and sweat\u2026 braved British atrocities \u2026 we don't need any certificate to prove our nationalist feelings especially from the ones who apologised to the British at that time\", asserted Priyanka, urging the workers to go to every household in their area and meet every voter. She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022. And once we come, we will stay here for long on the basis of our hard work,\" she said adding that the hard-workers would be adequately rewarded.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.
