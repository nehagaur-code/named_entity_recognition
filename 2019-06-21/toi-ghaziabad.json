Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

There are over 90 petrol and diesel filling stations in Ghaziabad.

To ensure compliance Singh meanwhile said that enforcing officers will randomly visit filling stations. \u201cWe can also ask for CCTV footages to check whether the directions is being complied or not \u201d said Singh Concerns have been raised that there is no laws and rules under which fuel could be denied to bikers without helmets. \u201cWe have plethora of rules like motor vehicle act and others under which bikers without helmets could be penalized but there is no rule as such under which one can deny fuel for not wearing helmet which have been brought to the notice of state government\u201d said Singh. \u201cThe state government in order to provide legal sanctity to the policy will soon issue a Government Order(GO)\u201d added Singh.

A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

The proposed rates is Rs 100 per sqm a year against the existing Rs 10 per sqm a year. A proposal to revise the rates would be placed in the GDA board meeting scheduled to be held on 25 June. There are about 13 educational institutions that have been given park/green land \u2014 a total of more than 90,000 sqm. \u201cThe existing rates has remained unchanged since 2011 and prior to 2011, it was just one rupee. So, it is time to revisit the rates that will be Rs 100/sqm a year. It would be a good source of revenue for the GDA,\u201d said Kanchan Verma, the vice-chairperson, GDA. \u201cThere have been complaints that many institutions are violating lease agreements, some saying that the parks and green belts are being treated as a particular institute\u2019s private property, which remains out of bounds for common people. In these cases, it becomes pertinent that while reviewing the lease, we will have to ascertain the extent of violation,\u201d Verma added. The misuse of parks leased out to institutions by the GDA was first highlighted by local councillor Rajender Tyagi. \u201cThere are many parks and green belts under educational institutions that have erected boundaries and merged those with the institutions, which is in violation of the norms,\u201d said Tyagi. \u201cThe GDA, for a long time, remained oblivious to these violations. As per the norms, institutions in no manner can bar common people from using these parks leased out by GDA,\u201d Tyagi added. \u201cAs a rule only 2% of park\u2019s land could be used for permanent construction.\u201d Verma said: \u201cWe are in the process of ascertaining to what extent institutions have violated the norms and only after that we will act to cancel the lease.\u201d Tyagi said schools are bound to provide parks for local children. \u201cAfter school, the institutions are required to offer theses parks and playgrounds to children of the neighborhood.

On May 29, 2019, Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) cancelled the allotment of a 11,503-square-yard plot to IMT after it found out that the institute had illegally encroached upon it. IMT challenged the order in court, stating that it came to know about it through media. A bench headed by Justice Manoj Misra and Justice Saurabh Shyam Shamshery has directed IMT to deposit Rs 5 crore with the GDA by July 15 and submit an application, along with a copy of the receipt, before the principal secretary of UP\u2019s urban planning and development authority by July 25, seeking regularisation of the allotment of the land on which the institute stands. Meanwhile, the state government has been directed to take a \u201creasoned decision\u201d by the next date of hearing, August 28. \u201cThe decision so taken by the government shall be produced through an affidavit by either of the parties\u2026 It is further made clear that the state government will take its own decision without being influenced by any of the observations made in this order,\u201d the court said. It has also directed GDA to refrain from taking any coercive action against IMT. The matter came to light in March, 2019, after BJP councillor Rajender Tyagi accused IMT of encroaching upon the plot. IMT, in its petition, accepted that there might have been negligence on its part in pursuing formalisation of transfer and payment with respect to the allotment of the land but GDA had been equally negligent with respect to the cancellation of the allotment. It also promised to get the allotment regularised but said its cancellation would cripple the institute, which had been in existence for 40 years. However, according to the GDA counsel, the authority had repeatedly issued notices to IMT to deposit the allotment money.

They then allegedly spread a rumour that Asif had drowned while taking a bath in the Ganga canal on the day of Eid.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs.

The crime had taken place in 2010, when the accused, a daily wager, was found guilty of torturing his wife for not acquiescing to their demand for a dowry of Rs 20,000 in cash and a gold ring, which forced her to commit suicide. Rachna, daughter of Meerut-resident Madanpal, got married to Maneesh, a resident of Govindpuri in Modinagar, on June 21, 2006. She was aged around 21 at the time. Her husband and in-laws, Sheela and Kailash, were not happy with the dowry she had brought and tortured her for that. Additional district government counsel (ADGC) Lokesh Kumar said, \u201cRachna\u2019s relatives tried to intervene on several occasions to resolve the matter with her husband, but to no avail. In the meantime, Rachna gave birth to two daughters, but even that didn\u2019t improve the situation.\u201d Unable to cope with the torture, Rachna, on August 8, 2010, committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling. Later, an FIR under IPC sections 498A (domestic violence), 304B (dowry death) and Dowry Prohibition Act was registered against the three accused, at Modinagar police station, following a local court\u2019s order, the ADGC said. However, the court during proceedings found evidence of IPC 306 (abetment of suicide) and not 304B. Altogether, nine witnesses were produced. Additional district judge Beena Chaudhary found the accused guilty of the crime and awarded the punishment. The ADGC said, \u201cUnder IPC 498A, the court handed down two years\u2019 jail term to each accused, and also imposed a fine of Rs 5,000. Likewise, under IPC 306, the court imposed six years and Rs 20,000, and under the Dowry Act, one year imprisonment and Rs 2,500 fine on each convict. All the jail terms will run concurrently.\u201d The accused were out on bail all those years, the ADGC added.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

These should not be mixed with municipal waste. Hence a fourth bin should be placed at all hospitals,\u201d he said, also urging residents to segregate waste at their homes also. In fact, the Noida Authority had last month written to all institutions in the the city, including RWAs, malls and hospitals, to start segregation of waste before June 30 and make arrangements for composting of wet waste, making it clear that its contractors will not pick up unsegregated waste from any locality or industrial area from next month.

While he lauded the remediation plant in Noida\u2019s Sector 54 as the first one in UP to initiate full remediation process, Singh lamented trash burning on the roadside and dumping of waste in the open across the twin cities and Ghaziabad. \u201cI toured Ghaziabad on Tuesday, and found the situation at Pratap Vihar plant to be very bad. No bio-remediation isdone there.\u201d Hindon pollution alarm Singh also expressed alarm at the dumping of waste in the Hindon, which he called a dead river with zero oxygen. \u201cThis is the height of violation of environmental norms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe catchment area of the river is polluted, the river water is polluted, and there is seepage of effluents in groundwater which seem to be alarming. Hindon has zero oxygen with no fish in the river and ecology is completely dead. In years to come, cases of cancer, asthma and colitis will rise if groundwater is not preserved,\u201d the panel chief said. Singh also said that polluted water is flowing into the Yamuna from two drains originating in Delhi \u2014 Kondli and Shahdara. \u201cBut the Delhi government is silent on the issue. All these are violations of environment norms,\u201d Singh said. On illegal constructions on Hindon flood plains, the former high court judge directed that they should be stopped by the authority concerned immediately. \u201cAll such structures should be razed,\u201d said Singh.

However, Airports Authority of India (AAI) has declined permission for night landings due to movement of nilgai on the air strip. The civil enclave of the IAF base was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March. The district administration, meanwhile, has urged the UP government to include Lucknow in the list of eight cities \u2014 Hubli, Jamnagar, Faizabad, Pithoragarh, Shimla, Kalburgi, Kannur and Nashik \u2014 that the airport will have flights to under the subsidised regional air connectivity scheme UDAN.

Once operational, Hindon will be the second airport in the NCR after Delhi\u2019s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, 40km away. However, the district administration said that the AAI has not given permission to operate night flights out of safety concern since the terminal and the air strip are not properly fenced. \u201cThe area is frequented by nilgai and AAI has said it could be risky if flights operate after dark,\u201d said Maheshwari. \u201cSo we have sought Rs 4.5 crore from the state civil aviation department for fencing the perimeter of the terminal.\u201d In addition, the administration has demanded another Rs 5 crore from the state government for constructing a drainage system at the civil enclave. \u201cThe fund will be used to construct and connect terminal\u2019s drainage system to Sikandarpur drain,\u201d said Maheshwari. On the question of converting the civil terminal into a permanent airport, the district administration said it had already submitted a feasibility report to the state government on the same. \u201cBut we are still awaiting reply from the government,\u201d the DM said. Hindon belongs to IAF but the civil enclave was developed by AAI. In 2017, the Union civil aviation ministry chose Hindon IAF base for starting commercial flights in a bid to decongest IGI Airport.

The proposal was cleared on Thursday at the GMC board\u2019s meeting, which passed the budget for 2019-20, pegging expenditure for the year at Rs 908 crore. The civic body said it expects to raise Rs 1,038 crore during the financial year.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

The court said the petitioners have the freedom to approach appropriate authorities regarding ownership of the land. While hearing a case filed by environmentalist Sushil Raghav, who had contended that about 50% of the lake has been encroached upon, NGT, on Tuesday, said the court is not deciding the title issue. \u201cThis court is only considering the environmental issues with a view to protect the water bodies which were encroached upon by unauthorised persons and unauthorised encroachments made by miscreants so as to reduce the water bodies into their possession. Under the circumstance, we do not think that it is necessary to implead the applicants in the execution proceedings. They are at liberty to move the appropriate forum to establish their rights in accordance with the law,\u201d the court order stated. The NGT, in September 2016, had ordered that the lake area be cleared of illegal structures and its sanctity restored. In 2017, Raghav filed a contempt plea in the case and the court heard the matter on April 22 this year, in which authorities sought more time, saying that since the election process was on, it would be difficult to get police force to carry out the drive. Later, the district authorities carried out an anti-encroachment drive on May 29 and demolished some structures. Subsequently, applications were moved by residents seeking impleadment and stay of proceedings. Applicants had argued that orders had been passed without hearing their grievances. They claimed they were not encroachers and had purchased properties on the basis of registered sale agreements and deeds and the areas were registered as private holdings in revenue records and it is not part of the water body. Now, when the authorities are implementing the NGT order residents have pleaded for impleading them as respondents in the case. Applicants also requested a stay on eviction proceedings.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The GDA, in 1986, had leased out 3,838 sqm of land to Hindi Bhawan Samiti at a concessional rate solely for the purpose of promotion of Hindi language. However, its lease was cancelled in 2006 after the management of Hindi Bhawan, located in Lohia Nagar, was found to be indulging in commercial activities and also not paying the dues.

The court said the petitioners have the freedom to approach appropriate authorities regarding ownership of the land. While hearing a case filed by environmentalist Sushil Raghav, who had contended that about 50% of the lake has been encroached upon, NGT, on Tuesday, said the court is not deciding the title issue. \u201cThis court is only considering the environmental issues with a view to protect the water bodies which were encroached upon by unauthorised persons and unauthorised encroachments made by miscreants so as to reduce the water bodies into their possession.

They are at liberty to move the appropriate forum to establish their rights in accordance with the law,\u201d the court order stated. The NGT, in September 2016, had ordered that the lake area be cleared of illegal structures and its sanctity restored. In 2017, Raghav filed a contempt plea in the case and the court heard the matter on April 22 this year, in which authorities sought more time, saying that since the election process was on, it would be difficult to get police force to carry out the drive. Later, the district authorities carried out an anti-encroachment drive on May 29 and demolished some structures. Subsequently, applications were moved by residents seeking impleadment and stay of proceedings. Applicants had argued that orders had been passed without hearing their grievances. They claimed they were not encroachers and had purchased properties on the basis of registered sale agreements and deeds and the areas were registered as private holdings in revenue records and it is not part of the water body. Now, when the authorities are implementing the NGT order by demolishing the buildings where applicants stay, saying these are illegal encroachments, residents have pleaded for impleading them as respondents in the case.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future? What new has she brought in?\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Shibani Dandekar's most sizzling pictures": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/shibani-dandekar-sizzling-pics/shibani-dandekars-most-sizzling-pictures/photostory/65770159.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Trash accumulated in society poses health hazard": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/trashaccumulatedinsocietyposeshealthhazard/articleshow/68606363.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Ghaziabad councillor booked for bribery": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/councillor-booked-for-bribery/articleshow/69732381.cms", "time": "2019-06-11 11:50:00", "description": "GHAZIABAD: An FIR has been registered on Monday against a councillor of Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC)for taking bribes from applicants of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) on the pretext of getting their files passed.
