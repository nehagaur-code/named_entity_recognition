Rogue driving is no more limited to main thoroughfares and it would need a Herculean effort by the cops to sanitize even the narrow alleys that have turned into racing circuits for bikers. The four-hour-long drive saw 607 prosecutions on Wednesday \u2014 205 of them were caught riding without helmets, 315 were challaned for triple-riding. Several others were found riding without a licence or any paper, leading to six bikes being seized. Besides DCPs from the traffic wing, the DCPs from the divisions also monitored these check points. \u201cBut the problem goes much beyond dry statistics. We will need a sustained effort to bring the discipline back,\u201d said a senior cop. Lalbazar has instructed its men to keep the campaign going, ensuring the spots are changed and the element of surprise is kept intact for the bikers. A feedback from the 25 traffic guards has shown that the bikers have now moved away from the main roads. \u201cThey are not taking the main thoroughfares for two reasons. One, they can avoid CCTV cameras and police checks. Two, if indeed they get caught, they can always claim they were out on a small local errand. Whether it is the Shyambazar-Shyampukur belt in the north or Golf Green-Lords crossing in the south, we need to either penetrate the bylanes or keep an option of chasing down errant riders,\u201d said an officer. According to police, the bikers are well-networked. \u201cReports of checks from one crossing is reaching youths on bikes several kilometres away. Hence, it is important we penetrate the organized network,\u201d said a source. The cops said that most of the bikers are not the real owners of the vehicles. \u201cOn several occasions, we found that people had borrowed bikes from friends, taken it on rent or taken the bike from the local garage for a spin. For this, we will need two things \u2013 one, we will need to ensure that the bikes at garages are under leash and two, we need each rider to show us documents pertaining to the bike they are riding,\u201d said an officer. Lalbazar officers also feel the violators who manage to escape one check point is nabbed at the next crossing. \u201cThe placement of teams has to be done intelligently. The idea is to set an example. We have seen that bikers, once prosecuted in the early hours of the night, tend to assume that they would not be prosecuted for the same offence again the same day. Hence, they keep violating rules. So, this time, we have decided to seize bikes,\u201d a senior officer at Lalbazar said.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Inspired by several Facebook and Tiktok troll videos, the gang used to snatch cellphones from bikers. And when the biker chased the snatcher, another person used to run away with the two-wheeler. The duo arrested were identified as Chandan Roy (23) and Raj Das (31). On Wednesday evening, the 24-year-old bike taxi operator was sitting on his motorbike near Balwant Singh Dhaba with a cup of tea when he received a call from a rider. When he was about to take the call, someone pushed him and he fell down. His phone was stolen before he could stand up. \u201cI suspected two youths walking away briskly and challenged them. But they said they had not taken my phone. I identified my ringtone when the phone was ringing in the pocket of one of the youths. The youth ran to an alley and I followed him. Later, I realised that I had left the bike with its key. When I went back, I saw my bike was also stolen,\u201d said the victim. As the sergeants Amit Kumar Shaw, Atanu Nandi and Sujay Pramanik reached the scene, they started questioning people around and visited the lane where the mobile snatcher had run. \u201cThe complainant identified the snatcher at a distance and we immediately started grilling him. We found the mobile phone with him and started asking him about his partner. Initially, he refused to give us the answer, but after some time he broke down and told us about the whereabouts of the other youth,\u201d said sergeant Shaw. The police went to another alley guided by the snatcher and after some search they spotted the complainant\u2019s bike parked at a corner of the road. \u201cWe waited for the thief to arrive and when he came near the bike around 10 minutes later, we chased him.

Accompanying him was his daughter, already an officer in the Army. The family can serve as an inspiration for the state that gradually earned the reputation of belonging to a \u2018non-martial\u2019 race. The colonel\u2019s children are the third generation to serve the country as soldiers. Their grandfather, Late Master Warrant Officer (MWO) B B Das, joined the Royal Indian Air Force and was based in Lahore in 1944 during World War II. He also fought the 1971 Indo-Pak War and went up to Jessore in what was then East Pakistan. He retired from the 253 Signals Unit in Barrackpore. Col Das graduated from St Xavier\u2019s College in Kolkata before joining the Assam Regiment in 1978. In a career spanning nearly 31 years, he was part of counter-insurgency operations across the country. He was also involved in peacekeeping operations with the Indian Peace Keeping Force at Jaffna in Sri Lanka. His exploits along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Arunachal Pradesh in 1986 prompted the Army to name a high-altitude post there \u2018Ashish Top\u2019. He served two tenures at Poonch in Jammu & Kashmir, once when militancy actually started there in 1988-\u201990. Das retired in 2009 and was appointed director of the Army\u2019s Placement Node in the eastern sector a couple of years later. He continued to head it till 2013. \u201cI have no regrets,\u201d Col Das said. \u201cMy daughter joined the Army as a legal officer in 2017 after graduating in law from Dehra Dun.

The persons held by the cops were identified as Sk Latifuddin (37) of Alimuddin Street and Sk Raja (47) of Hussain Shah Road. While around 255gm of brown sugar was seized from Latifuddin at the market cost of Rs 2 lakh, about 20gm of the contraband worth Rs 15,000 was recovered from Raja. \u201cWe have been making continuous arrests across the city, especially those operating around schools, colleges and the places where the youngsters hang out. We are booking the accused under NDPS Act. We will arrest more people involved with such offences,\u201d said joint CP (crime) Praveen Tripathi. The duo arrested told cops that they had received orders through WhatsApp andf delivered the contraband to the young addicts. The detective department investigators said the contraband is being spread through lesser known pubs, where students and techies are first lured into consumption of synthetic drugs and then turned into peddlers. Brown sugar is an adulterated form of heroin, is a semi-synthetic opioid, derived from the morphine extracted from poppy plants. These impurities make brown sugar cheaper than more purified form of heroin. Most brown sugar users prefer to smoke the drug, which burns at a lower temperature.

For starters, Kolkata Police sources said all security personnel at the six big government medical college and hospitals in the city\u2014MCH, NRS, RG Kar, CNMC, SSKM and Sagore Dutta\u2014would undergo a mandatory training at the Police Training School for a month. To be instructed by the same set of people who train RAF and Commando forces, the hospital personnel will be taught how to secure wards by not allowing outsiders any entry. But not everything will be about physical prowess. All the government teaching hospitals in Kolkata are set to get proper round-the-clock public grievance redress counters, to be handled by public relations officers. Each of the establishments will get four PROs, who will handle public queries and try to redress their grievances. TOI had reported on Wednesday that these hospitals had only grievance boxes and no dedicated official, as a result of which patients and their families had no one to interact with or turn to in time of distress. \u201cWhile we focussed on the security aspect during Wednesday\u2019s meet, we had a fruitful discussion on Thursday on how to address public grievances effectively,\u201d said state health secretary Rajiva Sinha. The meeting was held at Swasthya Bhawan, which was attended by Sinha, the six teaching hospitals\u2019 new nodal officers, principals, MSVPs, DME Pradip Mitra and director of health services Ajay Chakraborty. During the May 17 meet with junior doctors before the health service impasse was broken, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had asked health officials to explore the possibilities of deploying officials at every hospital who would redress public grievances and that they should be around all the time. Two new committees have also formed. One of them will look into the upgrade of emergency services and the other will examine how to enhance OPD services. The changes are not likely to be limited to the paper. At NRS, for example, an ACP\u2019s office has been set up right opposite the emergency ward entrance, a step taken not only to boost security but also to send across a message that cops are watching. A dozen security personnel were also seen scanning the visitors to the hospital. Other hospitals have also started working on crowd management. At SSKM Hospital, the emergency area now has a substantial number of cops keeping an eye on visitors. They said all cars parked illegally were being towed away. \u201cThe whole idea is to ensure only patients and their families are allowed inside. We are considering whether or not to issue smart tokens to ambulances and all other vehicles carrying in patients and relatives and to ask them to leave the premises within 15 minutes,\u2019\u2019 said a senior police officer.

While students from rural schools sprang surprises in the higher secondary examination, producing many among the top ten of the merit list, the JEE merit list was dominated by those from urban areas. This has underlined the necessity of a more disciplined and methodical study under experienced teachers focussed on the specialized preparation. According to experts, Apart from schools, coaching institutes play special roles in such performances, where the difference of even one mark can reflect heavily on the rank. This is why students from areas where such coaching is offered tend to fare well in JEE and NEET. Hem Sheela Model School, Durgapur, has done exceedingly well in JEE. Three students of the school managed to be among the top ten \u2014 a rare feat. \u201cIt is difficult to enlist the reasons for the success. Motivating students by conducting special subject-enrichment classes, individual attention and exposing them to advanced research areas through workshops and seminars could have propelled them to stay focussed,\u201d said Anindita Home Choudhury, principal of the school. Two students from South Point School managed to rank among the top ten. Spokesperson from the school Krishna Damani said, \u201cJEE, IIT entrance and NEET require a lot of specialized training and necessary infrastructure, which are still missing in mufassil towns and rural areas. Though the rural areas have no dearth of talent, they have no access to such facilities and intense practices\u201d Institutes such as Aakash, FIITJEE and Pathfinder, who complement school education with specialized training, revealed that ranking of students under their their care was on the rise. Strategic business unit head of FIITJEE Debdeep Banerjee pointed out that eight students from FIITJEE were in the top ten. FIITJEE has its centres in urban areas like Kolkata and Durgapur. He said, \u201cOur students, thanks to the training we offer, score high in such exams. However, there is discrepancy in the WBJEE, and JEE Advanced ranks of these students.\u201d \u201cAngikar Ghosal, who ranked fourth in JEE, secured AIR 161 in JEE Advanced. If the West Bengal board had a more synchronized approach like the state boards in the north or south, students will gain,\u201d Banerjee added. Pathfinder\u2019s Ashish Chakraborty said although the ranks of their students had risen since last year, they have not been as high as most were preparing for JEE Advanced. He said, \u201cMost students were trying for JEE Advanced as they want to move away from Bengal.

Muslims from various walks of life, who have been living in Kolkata for decades, highlighted two recent incidents: the NRS Medical College and Hospital violence last Monday and the hounding of model Ushoshi Sengupta and her app cab driver in the city this Monday. The accused, in both cases, were arrested within 24 hours of the incidents. \u201cThe attackers in both instances were members of our community. We are grieved and embarrassed. Bring the assailants to book not just in these two instances but in every single instance where Muslims are involved. They should not be allowed to get away because they happen to be Muslims (as is the growing perception). This will send out a message that members of one community are not being shielded or appeased (as most people bel-ieve),\u201d the letter \u2014 signed by 46 prominent Muslim citizens of Kolkata \u2014 states. They have also urged the state government to engage or encourage engagements with Muslim youth and their families across Kolkata in gender-sensitisation, civic consciousness and law-compliance. \u201cThis requires long-term patience but needs to be implemented right away,\u201d the letter says. Psychologist Zahid H Ganjee, one of the signatories, said: \u201cThere have been several lynching cases in the past year-and-a-half and sane voices from the Hindu community have demanded justice. Unfortunately, Muslims have not said and done enough when members of the community have acted like rogues. This has led to the entire community being tarnished. I hope the letter will spark a conversation, even a debate and then something good will come out of it. We are losing our primary identity as a citizen of this country and state. We need to reclaim it.\u201d Abdul Rahim, who runs an NGO, stressed the need for the community to receive fair and not privileged treatment. \u201cThere is a growing perception that the administration here is soft on Muslims who break the law. This perception needs to change. We want the law to be enforced without considering religious identity,\u201d he said. Communications expert Mudar Patherya, who drafted the letter after a discussion with several of the signatories, said there had been simmering discontent for some time. \u201cI will not comment on whether the perception (that the administration is soft on Muslims) is right or wrong. But I feel, till now, governments have looked at the next vote and not the next generation. The moment they do that, things will change positively. I believe Muslims need to take a position,\u201d he said. Rahim says the administration needs to reach out to the community in the ghettos and strengthen, educate and empower the youth. \u201cIf you consider each of the incidents, the culprits hailed from ghettos,\u201d he said. Most of the signatories feel the recurring crime by Muslim youths is to do with poverty and illiteracy in ghettos where they reside. Mamoon Akhtar, who runs a school (Samaritan Help Mission) in Tikiapara, says children can bring about great change if educated. But the letter has also drawn flak from a section of the community. Nutritionist Neha Hafiz, another signatory, took pains to point out that it was not a missive against the Trinamool government or its treatment of Muslims; but there was a need to change the perception that was being created about the community receiving more privileges than others. \u201cThere is a problem. We cannot deny it. And it needs to be addressed. Blaming anyone does not help. There is a need for education and reforms,\u201d she said.

Monsoon clouds are already over the Bay of Bengal area. Along with this, a low pressure area over the Northeast Bay has given us the hope for the rains to hit Kolkata and other parts of south Bengal by Friday,\u201d said G K Das, director (weather) at Regional Meteorological Centre, Kolkata. The Southwest monsoon reached the Kerala coast on June 8, seven days later than its scheduled date. Usually, the scheduled date for the monsoon to arrive in Kolkata is June 10, with an error margin of four days. In 2018, it hit Kolkata on June 11, 13 days later. In 2017, monsoon kept its date with the city on June 12, again 13 days after its onset in Kerala. If it hits the city on Friday, as predicted by the Met office, it will maintain its 13-day gap between its arrival in Kerala and Kolkata. Monsoon has already covered parts of Cooch Behar and Alipurduar. By Thursday, it had also touched some parts of neighbouring South and North 24 Pargans.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

For the past few years, Bali has been one of the most favoured places among Kolkatans as the Indonesian archipelago offers something for travellers of all ages. Although June to September is the best time to visit Bali, the popularity of the place, thanks to social media, has made it an all-year-round favourite with over 22,000 people from Kolkata visiting the beach hotspot every year. \u201cCancellation of the direct AirAsia flight has not affected tourist flow to Bali. In fact, the traveller count has increased over time. Now, passengers fly via Bangkok or Singapore to reach the Indonesian island. All flights travelling to Bali on average clock 60-70% occupancy,\u201d said Anil Punjabi, regional (east) chairman of the Travel Agents\u2019 Federation of India. Since the beach city offers visa-on-arrival facility, more travellers are seen preferring it to other nearby tourist destinations such as Maldives and Mauritius, he said. \u201cBali, with its boutique resorts, is also popular for honeymoon and weddings.\u201d Didit Indra Purnawarman, the general manager of Bali Dynasty Resort, feels the tourist hotspot offers something for people from all segments with an array of restaurants, bars, swimming pools and nightclubs. Another agent from the city said Pujas and the summers witness maximum rush. \u201cAround 450 to 500 people from Kolkata travelled to Bali between March and May this year. It has a yearlong traction since it is a low-budget international destination. Also, the island city is on high demand since a lot of people are now selecting Bali as a destination wedding location over Thailand,\u201d Ankit Jain, business development manager, Raj Yatayat. Bali provides a healthy mix of modern and traditional attractions such as beach, jungles, volcanic destinations and yoga retreats. Among the beaches, Nusa Dua is one of the most prominent ones, known for its inclusive tourism, as it houses some of the best world-class resorts, mostly owned by international hotel chains. Also, one should not miss beaches like Kuta, Legian, Seminyak, Jimbaran, Sannur and Canggu. Oriol Montal, the general manager of The Westin Resort in Nusa Dua, said: \u201cThe resort has a prime beachfront location within an exclusive enclave on the island\u2019s southern shores catering to the needs of leisure and business travellers alike.\u201d For coffee connoisseurs, a cup of Kopi Luwak, one of the costliest brews (a 50gm pack costs around Rs 1,000) made of beans that have been partially digested by the Asian palm civet, is a must try.

In fact, these youths, who took up odd jobs at garages and markets, picked up any bike or car that they could lay their hands on for their late-night rides. \u201cThey would often go out at night \u2014 thanks to their access to garages.

The youths might have demanded money for repairs of the scooter. We might not be financially not well off, but we believe that the model was not harmed,\u201d said the mother of an accused.

And the toppers all hail from urban centres, a pointer to the importance of specialized coaching. Eight of the top 10 studied in CBSE schools, and one each were from ISC and HS boards, underscoring the dominance of the central board in competitive examinations. Soham Mistri, a student of Hem Sheela Model School in Durgapur, has stood first. Two other students from the school figure in the top 10: third rank-holder Koustav Sen and 10th rank-holder Subhajyoti Ghosh. The seventh rank-holder, Vinit Raj, is from Burnpur Riverside School in Chittaranjan, not far away. The rest are all from Kolkata, including second rank-holder Tamajit Banerjee and fourth rank-holder Angikar Ghoshal from South Point School, and sixth rank-holder Snehinh Sen from DPS Ruby Park. Only one of the toppers \u2014 fifth rank-holder Arka Das of Sarada Vidyapith, Sonarpur \u2014 is from the HS board an improvement from last year, when none made it to the list. A matter of concern is that the number of successful candidates (those who scored higher than 0) has plummetted from 1,05,081 last year to 80,580. Though 1,13,912 students registred for the exam, 80,979 appeared. Last year, 1,05,974 had registered. The reason for the massive decline in the number of students who appeared this year is primarily owing to a month\u2019s delay in holding the exam due to the Lok Sabha elections. Most other competitive exams had already been held by the time WBJEE was conducted. Academics also say there is a general decline in the demand for engineering, because of a limitation in job opportunities. This is reflected in the WBJEE board\u2019s decision to scrap the fourth round of counselling that was introduced a few years ago and return to three rounds of counselling. \u201cThe response had been poor among candidates to join engineering courses after the end of three rounds, as most of the vacant seats then were in lesser known engineering colleges. Another reason is the time constraint this year, as the entrance test and publication of results have been pushed back by a month due to the Lok Sabha elections,\u201d said a board member. The late publishing of results may also lead to vacancy in undergraduate classes in colleges, particularly in the science stream, as many students who have taken admission and have secured a good rank at WBJEE will now switch to engineering institutes. Classes in colleges is set to begin in the first week of July. Aware of the impending exodus to IITs and other engineering institutes across the country, the WBJEE board has decided to allow all candidates who have scored above 0 to participate in e-counselling. \u201cWe are yet to receive the seat matrix as All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) is in the process of trimming the seats and departments which are not meeting the set standards. Last year, there were around 35,000 engineering seats in Bengal,\u201d an official said.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination.

The Battle of Plassey was fought on June 23, 1757 and the discovery was made nearly 262 years later to date. According to Haringhata BDO Krishna Gopal Dhara, the cannon is very old. The weapon is made of brass and it is nearly 4 feet 2 inches in length. History has it that Robert Clive used eight six-pounders apart from two howitzers during the decisive battle against the forces of Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah. Historians believe recovery of cannon while restoration of the Yamuna canal is also significant. At that time, an intricate network of canals existed in the area and the Yamuna canal was dug to connect the Ganga to the Padma and the Ichhamati. Some say Clive\u2019s troops may have used the canal to travel to and from Plassey, about a 112-km from Haringhata. Such small cannons, used to fire balls weighing about six-pounds (2.7 kg) were used extensively across the globe in the 18th and 19th Centuries, primarily due to their manoeuvrability. In the Battle of Plassey, Clive is said to have flanked the European troops with three six-pounders on each side while placing the remaining two and the howitzers behind some brick kilns to take on the French troops, who were fighting alongside Siraj-ud-Daulah. While the Nawab too used artillery guns, they were of heavier calibre. \u201cIt was found at South Rajapur. While one end of the cannon is 17-inches in diameter, the body tapers to end up with a 12-inch base. There is also a handle to fix the cannon to base, either on a carriage or the deck of a boat. We have kept the item in our custody and informed the Archaeological Survey of India so that experts come and examine it,\u201d said Ashoktaru Mukherjee, IC, Haringhata police station. Locals also speak of a Nil Kuthi in Haringhata, possibly occupied by indigo planters. This property had a ghat and British craft used to move along the canal to get there. But they can\u2019t say whether indigo planters would need a six-pounder to deal with poor peasants. \u201cThe cannon must have some historic significance and needs to be preserved properly after inspection by experts. We just hope that after proper cleaning and repairs, it is displayed prominently somewhere in Haringhata with a plaque for everybody to see,\u201d said Manik Das, a local.

KMC is already planning a crackdown on unscrupulous units. More than 100 residents of Vidyasagar Colony, Baghajatin and Ramgarh tested positive for Hepatitis A \u2014 which spreads from infected food or water \u2014 in less than a fortnight, as reported by TOI on May 31. Times ViewNow that the KMC has evidence, it should act against all unscrupulous bottlers who may be putting the citizen\u2019s health at risk. The action needs to be in the form of a sustained campaign.Now, the test results from the KMC laboratory, confirming the presence of the bacteria, have triggered alarm bells far beyond these areas. With packaged drinking water being widely distributed and consumed across the city, there are fears of more cases emerging from other areas. Physician Sanjay Dasgupta, who is treating more than 50 Hepatitis A patients from these localities, said several packaged water brands had cropped up locally, which sell contaminated water. \u201cI am convinced that packaged drinking water has been a major source of contamination,\u201d he said. \u201cApart from poor quality of production, most city-based manufacturers and traders also ignore the hygiene factor, which leads to health hazards and may cause stomach-related diseases like colitis and jaundice,\u201d said physician Sanjay Dasgupta. Coliform bacteria are organisms that are present in the environment and in the faeces of all warm-blooded animals and humans. These bacteria will not likely cause illness, but their presence in drinking water indicates the presence of disease-causing organisms (pathogens) in the water system. Most pathogens that can contaminate water supplies come from the faeces of humans or animals. Since testing drinking water for all possible pathogens is complex, time-consuming and expensive, a relatively easy and less expensive test is done for coliform bacteria to rule whether the water is safe to drink. Deputy mayor Atin Ghosh, who also looks after KMC\u2019s health department, has directly blamed units selling spurious packaged drinking water for the spread of enteric diseases in Kolkata and called for a crackdown, with help from the enforcement department. \u201cWe need to get rid of unscrupulous traders dealing in packaged drinking water. Going by laboratory tests, we have reasons to worry about the samples of packaged drinking water collected from the affected areas,\u201d Ghosh said. Last year, too, during an outbreak in the Jadavpur-Baghajatin belt that claimed two lives and sent hundreds to hospital, fingers had been pointed at suspect packaged drinking water units. Whereas contamination in civic taps or pipelines is easier to detect and control, the spread of illness can become much wider if the contamination source is spurious packed water, as it is distributed in PET bottles and jars. Last May, following the outbreak, KMC\u2019s water department had collected 20-litre packaged water jars from several vendors and dealers in the affected localities. There is another reason for concern. Debasish Mukherjee, the RSP councillor in the affected belt, said: \u201cUnlike water supplied by KMC, which is filtered or boiled before consumption in various households, contaminated packaged drinking water is dangerous because people presume it is safe and consume it directly.\u201d A KMC laboratory analysis of water samples from several packaged water bottles and jars, as well as civic taps in the affected belt, found presence of coliform bacteria in large numbers. This is the second time that water from these localities has been found contaminated. In the days following the initial reports of the Hepatitis A outbreak, around 14 water samples were collected, of which 12 were found to contain coliform bacteria.

Shahenshah Mirza, the great-great grandson of Wajid Ali Shah, the last nawab of Awadh who settled in Kolkata in 1856, says the letter had gone down well with most of the people he knew. \u201cThere is an overwhelming feeling that whenever crime happens, demonstrative action should be taken irrespective of faith and political affiliation. There has been a growing perception in recent years that politicians in Bengal are trying to appease Muslims for their votes. That is not true. I believe it is propaganda. We don\u2019t want anyone to appease the community. All we want is a level-playing field. But because of this perception, many from other communities are turning anti-Muslim. Hence, we have decided to speak out when any such incident happens so that we make our stand clear,\u201d he said. Communications professional Mudar Patherya, who had drafted the letter, said the response from the Muslim community had been largely encouraging. But social activist Shafkat Alam, who was also among the signatories, felt the letter could perhaps have been worded differently to avoid misinterpretation. Alam\u2019s friend Shahab Kalim offered a compelling argument that he was unable to dismiss. \u201cNo, I am not embarrassed because the accused (attack on doctors at NRS and cabby driving a model) are Muslims. I am appalled because my religion is being made to stand in the court of criminals. Why are these incidents being highlighted by the religion of the accused? It\u2019s great if the attention of the CM is drawn towards the issue of lack of education amongst Muslim youths, especially ghetto areas. But bouncing the real issue on the springboard of stray incidents is pretentious. Those guys do not represent Muslim youth; they only represent the lawlessness of society,\u201d wrote Kalim, pointing out that Kawariyas who harass many during their yatras are not viewed a religious problem but an administrative issue. His voice found resonance in Anuradha Kapur, founder of women\u2019s empowerment group Swayam. \u201cI feel it is so unfair that they have to come up with a letter like this. When a Hindu commits a crime, we say a person has committed it. Then why should it be different when the person is Muslim? If one looks at the number of women who are raped or sexually harassed, I think the number of Hindu perpetrators will be representative of the Hindu population and likewise for Muslims\u201d she pointed out. Samantak Das, professor of Comparative Literature at Jadavpur University, felt likewise. While everyone ought to feel ashamed of being a part of the system or culture that breeds goons, the entire Muslims is tarnished when a criminal turns out to be Muslim. \u201cWhen one belongs to a beleaguered minority that is singled out for abuse and widely perceived as essentially violent, perhaps one is left with no other option but to apologise for the actions of those with whom one has no other affiliation than religion.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Redmi 7A": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/xiaomi-redmi-7a-may-launch-in-india-next-month/articleshow/69872521.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Narendra Modi": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/motto-of-yoga-is-peace-prosperity-harmony-pm-modi/articleshow/69884003.cms", "time": "", "description": "RANCHI: Appealing to people to take yoga to all sections of society, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said yoga is above everything, as he performed various asanas with around 40,000 enthusiasts at the Prabhat Tara ground here to mark the fifth International Day of Yoga.

He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

The moment the local market reopened on Thursday after a four-day shutdown, he had rushed there to buy ingredients. Around 11.15am, he was returning home with his purchase, when he got caught in a battle of bombs and bullets between a group and cops and was reportedly shot dead. Yards away, another phuchka-seller from the area, Dharamveer Shaw (39), was killed as another stray bullet pierced his belly. Residents of Bhatpara said Rambabu still clutched onto his bags as his lifeless body lay on the road, barely three blocks from his one-room home, where his widowed mother and two younger brothers waited for him. \u201cRambabu was way more responsible than any boy of his age. After his father died 10 years ago, he quit studying to start earning. He had not gone out to sell phuchkas the last three days because of the violence. The market had reopened only on Thursday in cop presence. But he was hit by a bullet when he was walking back home,\u201d said Ajit Kumar Shaw, a nextdoor neighbour at Kachhari Bazar in Bhatpara. Witnesses told Ajit that Rambabu had tried to dodge the bullets and bomb splinters but one from behind caught him in the head. \u201cHe collapsed in front of a shop but the owner downed the shutter. None came to his rescue. Had he been taken to hospital immediately, he could have been saved,\u201d Ajit said.  No help came for Dharamveer either. Even as he lay on the road, writhing in pain and pleading for assistance, people ran past him, scurrying for cover, witnesses said. \u201cWith bullets flying and bombs exploding, residents shut their doors and shop owners downed the shutters. None dared to go near the victims,\u201d said a resident. It was at least 20 minutes later that some from the locality, along with cops, took Rambabu and Dharamveer to the Bhatpara state general hospital, where Rambabu was declared dead. Dharamveer died at another hospital. He is survived by his wife and two teen children. Later, when TOI visited the victims\u2019 homes at Kachhari Bazar, an eerie silence had descended on the area. Cops patrolled the streets. \u201cThe scene has become almost regular since the assembly bypoll last month. Such has been the state of terror that I have kept my shop closed for more than 20 days since May 19. After today\u2019s incident, no one is going to open their shops for another three to four days,\u201d said Rajesh Shaw, a stationery shop owner.

It was triggered by a low pressure and a cyclonic circulation and could be followed by more rain on Thursday. Monsoon could hit south Bengal on Friday, said the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). Kolkata recorded a maximum temperature of 37.6\u00b0C on Wednesday. Wednesday\u2019s thunderstorm was accompanied by gusty winds that reached a maximum speed of 48kmph. But it didn\u2019t last a minute to qualify as a squall. The day temperature is set to drop on Thursday and the city could remain cloudy. \u201cLow pressure over north Bay of Bengal and a cyclonic circulation that has formed near Jharkhand have started generating clouds. These could float into Kolkata and lead to moderate rain on Thursday. More showers are expected as the low pressure intensifies and we expect monsoon to set in by Friday,\u201d said RMC director GK Das. On Wednesday, several south Bengal districts, including Midnapore, Jhargram, Hooghly and Burdwan, received heavy showers. Weathermen said the rain could gradually intensify across the rest of south Bengal over the next two-three days. \u201cSince the relevant currents have started reviving, we expect the showers to pave the way for monsoon,\u201d Das added. Cyclone Vayu that hit the Gujarat coast earlier this month had stalled the monsoon currents. The Bay branch of the monsoon, which hits south Bengal by the second week of June, was affected. Instead of June 1, which was the scheduled date for its arrival in Kerala, monsoon reached the southern Bengal on June 8. The monsoon arms, including the Bay branch, remained inactive till Vayu passed by. The delay in the onset of monsoon left south Bengal hot and humid. While the maximum temperature in coastal districts remained two-three degrees above normal, a heat-wave warning was sounded for Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum, West Midnapore and Jhargram.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

By her own admission, few among those who had taken a dig at her once are \u201chappy\u201d that she is now a member of Parliament. Others are requesting her to address the problems that are plaguing the Bengali film industry. Days after she attended Parliament, Locket spoke to CT about her plans for organising a meeting of Tollywood artistes with the prime minister and what she expects from fellow Parliamentarians Nusrat Jahan and Mimi Chakraborty. Excerpts: How was your first day at Parliament?It was a good experience. All this while, I used to tune in to the television to watch the proceeding inside Parliament. To walk down those hallowed corridors is a great feeling. More so, because I contested the elections as a leader from the opposition and won. Did you meet other Parliamentarians from the entertainment industry?Nusrat and Mimi weren\u2019t there. I saw Satabdidi (Satabdi Roy). Dev was there too. Dev\u2019s current identity is that of a politician as well as an entertainer. Though you come from the world of movies and serials, you have long distanced yourself from acting and are extremely active at most political events\u2026I had noticed that entertainers were not considered to be hardcore politicians in Bengal. I had always wanted to break that image. I have not joined politics to make a guest appearance. I have worked very hard for it and I don\u2019t wish to be taken lightly. I came to Delhi on Saturday. On Sunday, we had a meeting of a Parliamentary executive committee. This is a very serious body and they must have seen something in me before choosing me to be the whip in charge of the party\u2019s women members. I have been made one of the three whips to handle women BJP MPs. A total of 18 whips were appointed to work under the BJP\u2019s chief whip. The whips are expected to assist the chief whip in ensuring the presence of MPs in the House when important bills are taken up. The Parliament session begins at 11 am. Before that, we have a meeting at 10 am. There were people from the industry who had once called you \u2018palti didi\u2019 when you changed sides. Has their attitude towards you changed now?I won\u2019t take names. Many are calling me up now. Some of them who are present at meetings of the ruling dispensation have called me up privately and said they are very proud of me. They have messaged me saying: \u201cEgiye jaa. Songe achhi (Go ahead. We are with you)\u201d. What do you tell them then?I just smile and say: \u201cBhalo thakis (stay well)\u201d. I don\u2019t know what they will do in future. These were my old friends from the industry. In between, for some reason, they didn\u2019t keep in touch. Now, they are back. My roots lie in Tollywood. Those returning to re-establish ties with me are always welcome. Some had gravitated to a certain side because they felt doing that would ensure jobs for them. But they got used in the process without getting the jobs that they had fancied. Babul Supriyo has acted in more movies after he became a member of Parliament than what he did when he hadn\u2019t joined politics. Haven\u2019t acting offers increased for you now?(Laughs) Since 2016, I was not allowed to do any films. Now, I don\u2019t have the time for movies. The industry often recognises the skillsets of artistes once they are in positions of power. Is there any new-found respect for your acting skill?Yes, people are talking about my acting skills. Since the past six months, people are sending their scripts across to me. I am now being approached for committees formed regarding acting. Are you amused by this shift?(Laughs) Nothing really affects me now. Those who ignored me till yesterday now want to exchange pleasantries with me. Amar songe emon tui-tukari korchhe jeno roj anekhon adda martam amra (They talk to me in a way that makes me feel that we have long adda sessions regularly). They send me scripts, insisting that my presence will help the projects. I have seen the world enough to not get perturbed by all this. There are talks of you spearheading a movement in Tollywood that will challenge the functioning style here\u2026Many, including veteran artistes, are calling me up. But let me make it very clear. Here, I talk as an artiste and not a politician. I know the problems that exist in the film industry. As an artiste, I can fight for the rights of my fellow members from the industry. Payments for overtime are not cleared. Earlier sets were built for shooting. Now, artistes are taken to real locations and asked to shoot without providing the required infrastructure to the unit. The working conditions are terrible.How do you propose to change all this?There has to be an end to this. There is the nagging problem of making unreasonable demands to outstation crews if they want to shoot in Bengal. Many of them are so fed up with this \u201ctolabaji\u201d that they just come, see the locations, say \u201cthank you so much\u201d and then shoot in Mumbai. They are forced to take technicians who are ill-quipped to handle the equipment. This can\u2019t just go on. I have worked with small units too where films were made with passion and on shoestring budgets. We all pitched in and took less remuneration because we wanted the films to be made. However, things got derailed. Despite the best efforts, these projects couldn\u2019t happen because of the enormous demands of the guilds. Nobody could protest. Veteran hair dressers don\u2019t get their due while newbies with no skillset are given monetary rewards. Producers \u2014 who used to once do a lot of big serials \u2014 simply vanished because they got no slot to showcase their programmes. Bengali film productions abroad had to fold up. Shootings have got cancelled. This involves the future of so many people. How can the industry grow if all such things are allowed? Are you trying to form an alternative guild/forum?I want to fight for those who have been exploited. They are the ones who will lead the movement in Tollywood. I will be there beside them to create this alternative space. Bollywood stars had gone to meet the Prime Minister. Do you have any such plans for Tollywood?Of course, I do. I would want to organise a meeting with a core group from Tollywood and our prime minister. I want to brief him on the current situation in Tollywood. Many technicians and artistes have expectations from me. I have to meet those expectations. Can we expect to see a selfie of Tollywood artistes with the prime minister?Yes. But it\u2019s not about selfies. I want the meeting to help the industry. There is already talks about two groups by BJP leaders \u2014 one by director Shankudeb Panda and another by designer Agnimitra Paul \u2014 forming two separate units in Tollywood. This has become a butt of ridicule and confusion. What\u2019s your take on that?These are just means to divert the attention away from the actual problems plaguing Tollywood. Why create rifts when we are only trying to improve the condition of the industry? I want to find out a means by which elderly technicians can be given pension. They have given years to the industry but there is no one to look after them once they are past their prime. Why should I be distracted by talks about rifts when I am only concerned about standing beside those who are in need and/or have been exploited in this industry for years? When it comes to the film industry and politics, entertainers are often up for a lot of challenges. Mimi and Nusrat were trolled heavily when they contested and even on their attire at the Parliament. What do you have to say to that?I don\u2019t support the way Mimi and Nusrat were trolled. No one should face this. Nusrat\u2019s marriage is in the news. Do you have any message for her?I wish her the very best for her new journey ahead. While marriage is a big event in one\u2019s life, she must not ignore the promises she made while contesting the elections in Basirhat. From cutting hay with village belles to riding autos, entertainers across party lines have often engaged in various gimmicks while asking for votes. Once they win the polls, they disappear from the constituency. Does that impact the image of entertainers-turned-politicians? Is that why star politicians are often not taken seriously?All I can say is that it isn\u2019t fair to fool your voters. A leader can\u2019t ask for votes, claim to be just a phone call away and then vanish in the time of need. Being an MP is a big responsibility. The poor expect certain things from their elected leader. Guest appearances by star politicians are a huge let down. If you can say you are the \u2018ghorer meye\u2019 before the polls, you have to be around when the \u2018ghor\u2019 is burning. You can\u2019t give alibis for personal events and shy away from your responsibilities. Nusrat should visit Sandeshkhali and spend time there. How frequently will Hooghly get to see you?I am returning on Saturday and will be going there on Sunday.

I understand that the situation cannot improve overnight. But I trust that things will start changing for better from now on,\u201d the young doctor told TOI.

Both Yash and Mukhopadhyay, who started their internship in March, are now fighting the mental trauma that the attack has caused. Tekwani pointed out that the mob attacked them but all they had made every effort to save the patient. They had even administered life-saving drugs, he claimed. \u201cIt was a mob of around 200 with sticks and bricks, assaulting us in front of the police. How could those truckload of people be allowed inside the hospital in the first place? I will never forget that incident. But I will not let it scare me away from work,\u201d he said. Thanking those who supported the movement by junior doctors, Tekwani said, \u201cThis was required so that such incidents can be prevented in future. Thanks to my friends and teachers for looking after me well.\u201d Tekwani has not let his parents visit him in Kolkata as he feared the protest might worry them even more. Now that he has been discharged from hospital, he will go home to recuperate, as advised by doctors. But before leaving, he plans to visit Mukhopadhyay and try to talk him him of his trauma. \u201cInternship is a crucial part of my training. We are doctors and we cannot afford to keep ourselves away from patients. I would have loved to join duty immediately, had the doctors not advised complete rest.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

Similarly, the journey from Mumbai to Delhi could be completed in just 10 hours. The railways has set the target to increase the maximum speed of trains on these routes to 160 kmph to cut down the travel time between the national capital and financial capital by five hours and save five-and-half-hours\u2019 journey time between Delhi and Kolkata. The fastest trains now (Rajdhani) can run at a maximum speed of 130 kmph. This is among the clutch of proposals that the railways has finalised as a part of its 100-day agenda under the second edition of the Narendra Modi government. The railways estimates spending of about Rs 13,500 crore in shoring up the national transporter\u2019s infrastructure over the next four years. According to a circular issued by Railway Board chairman V K Yadav, enhancing track infrastructure on these two busy routes is necessary as they account for nearly 30% of passenger and 20% of total freight traffic on the rail network. Yadav has instructed officials to initiate immediate action to start implementing the plans by August 31 and the ministry has sent the proposals to the PMO. Sources said Yadav on Wednesday shared the details of the targets including the plan to bring in private players to run passenger trains on select routes at a meeting of Group of Secretaries on infrastructure. TOI on Wednesday reported the move by railways to open up the passenger segment for private entities and the plan to launch a mega campaign to pursue people to \u201cgive up\u201d the concessions that they can avail while buying tickets. The railways has also proposed to obtain all approvals in the next 100 days to eliminate 2,568 level crossings on Golden Quadrilateral and diagonals with rail over bridges and rail under bridges. It has estimated spending of about Rs 50,000 crore in the next four years for this and the entire funding will come from Centre. This will be level two government intervention to do away with level crossing. Earlier, the government had eliminated \u201cunmanned level crossings\u201d either with ROBs/ RUBs or by deploying people after installing gates. Constructing of ROBs and RUBs will ensure seamless traffic movement across the tracks. Other targets include obtaining Cabinet approval for a digital corridor for railways with provision of 10 MHz spectrum in 700 MHz frequency band for railways which will enable it to increase trains\u2019 carrying capacity due to increase speed potential, improve operation during fogs and improved security. Other proposals include providing Wi-Fi at all 6,485 railway stations, starting a pilot for an advanced signalling system, jump-starting process redevelopment of 50 railway stations and restructuring of the Railway Board.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

Thursday\u2019s deaths took the body count in Bhatpara to five since May 23, the day Lok Sabha poll results were announced and Trinamool rebel Arjun Singh was declared the winner in a fiercely contested fight for the Barrackpore seat. The state government clamped prohibitory orders after Thursday\u2019s violence and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee gave cops a 72-hour deadline to restore normalcy. Thursday\u2019s violence started around 10.45am about 100 metres from the police station that was supposed to be inaugurated by Virendra. (He was on his way to Bhatpara for the ceremony but turned back towards Nabanna as news of the violence broke; he later returned to the spot but to probe the violence.) Two bombs fell near the labour office gate of the Reliance Jute Mill as workers queued up for their morning shift. The blasts led to widespread panic but, in a few minutes, a crowd of several hundred gathered at the Bhatpara crossing. They chased away the miscreants, who fled towards Kachhari Bazar, and all was quiet for about 30 minutes. But, around 11.20am, a fresh round of violence \u2014 with bombs and gunfire \u2014 started at Kachhari Bazar, which had reopened on Thursday morning after two weeks following assurance from cops to shop owners that adequate protection would be provided for their security. Phuchka (pani puri) seller 17-year-old Rambabu Sau, who was returning home from the market, was hit by a stray bullet. Another bullet hit 49-year-old Dharamveer Shaw in the abdomen. Both died almost immediately at the spot. There were contradictory accounts of what led to the two deaths and what happened immediately after that. The victims\u2019 kin alleged cops opened fire and this led to the deaths. A few locals claimed they saw armed miscreants roaming around with pistols; a CCTV grab, showing masked men walking with pistols, corroborated this account. But cops said they opened fire in the air in self-defence. The bombs were thrown from West Ghoshpara Lane, they added. Six policemen were injured. Barrackpore MP Singh squarely blamed police. \u201cCops have given a free run to Trinamool workers. Seven people have been shot at,\u201d he said. Trinamool Congress leader Madan Mitra countered: \u201cIt is sad that Singh has cited police firing for the deaths when officials clearly fired in the air. The BJP is seeped in the politics of violence.\u201d The state government took a grim view of the situation. Virendra, who cut short his morning Bhatpara visit, went straight to Nabanna for a meeting with state chief secretary Malay De and state home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay. CM Banerjee gave the administration three days to control the situation. She was also angry with the police firing and questioned why history-sheeters were allowed a free run, officials said. Home secretary Bandyopadhyay later told reporters that Section 144 was clamped in two police station areas. \u201cDGP Virendra and additional director-general of police (South Bengal) Sanjay Singh have been asked to reach the spot. The CM is monitoring the situation,\u201d he said, requesting everyone to desist from inflammatory speech and messages.

Are you seeing them as a threat?There is no reason for us to feel threatened. I feel no need to react or counter. I am not aware of what they are saying. Ours is an all-India-based non-political organisation. We have over 7,000 members in the Federation. That excludes 2,500 to 3,000 artistes. I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on what is being done politically. I have doubts about the credentials of those who are claiming that work isn\u2019t happening in this industry. The problems that had festered in the industry after the 34 years of Left regime have been sorted out because we have all united to fight the malice. If work is happening, there will be problems. We sit across the table and sort out the problems. What about the non-clearance of dues? Fingers are being pointed at not just one producer. Other names have also cropped up\u2026We have started processing the dues. I only know of one producer with whom people have issues. As far as my knowledge goes, all the dues have more or less been cleared. We have no complaints from technicians regarding dues from other producers. Is there a meeting on June 23?Yes, we are holding an extraordinary general body meeting where a number of issues will be discussed. We don\u2019t need to meet to counter anyone. This meeting will be held to ensure better working environment. Producers have also been invited to discuss issues involving payments. Will shooting get stalled that day?Yes, we have requested that. If someone wants to increase the shooting time the day after, we will allow that. Problems regarding payments have also cropped up with suppliers. Are you aware of that?I have heard of that problem. But suppliers have a different guild. So, I can\u2019t really talk about that. There are talks about many of your guild members who are not technically sound. What\u2019s the criterion for getting a guild card?A person has to be technically sound to get a card. We see the qualification and past experience. At least two or three years of experience is required. We prefer if an assistant director is a graduate. Is there a fixed format? A hairdresser might not need to be a graduate to do the job. How do you judge if they are good or not? They can just claim that they are good. Who decides whether or not a person makes the cut?Fields like direction, camera, art direction and editing need proper training from institutes. There is so much of learning required to do good makeup or even hair. Work experience is of huge help. We keep an eye on both these factors while giving a card. If we send a makeup artist to a set where the director wants a certain look, he or she has to deliver. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t work. We have heard of complaints against many card-holders who are technically challenged and end up being a baggage on sets when it comes to handling high-end cameras etc. Have you ever taken away their cards?We have very few members who are inexperienced or don\u2019t know work. Even if we are to believe that this number is 5%, do you take away their cards? After all, they are a burden for any production unit\u2026They go to assist the main technicians. We need assistants for makeup and hair too. Are you organising technical workshop/training for such members?We plan to do that in November-December.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The autumn-winter collection that the designers showcased in Kolkata on Sunday, set new benchmarks in men\u2019s couture wear. An ode to the past: The collection, \u2018The Prince Unknown\u2019, took inspiration from the bygone era, but the balance of contemporary and traditional was well achieved in the designs that were all about structured silhouettes, drapes and layers. Says Shantanu, \u201cWe have always been inspired by the pre-Independence era. Through this collection, we revisited the palaces and had an insight into the lives of royalty. The princes and kings had a charming appeal and were known for their unique and classic style. They were fearless, indulgent and knew what luxury is. We wanted to show that prince and rulers in the past had a life which pretty much had the motto of work hard, party harder. So the fearless attitude is reflected in the structured silhouettes. There was also a bit of feminine touch through the drapes and layered effect. We used a lot of raw silk, jerseys to create that fall and effect in drapes and layers in kurtas.\u201d Of Nehru jackets and waistcoats: From rich tones like royal blue and maroon to subtle shades like beiges, brown and grey, the collection presented a mix of shades. Muted embroidery on jackets, texturing and fine detailing were noteworthy. Layered kurtas, bandhgalas, sherwanis with churidaars were part of the collection. The designers paid a lot of attention to jackets. \u201cThis time the emphasis is on our love for Nehru collars. Nehru collar was given different shapes, some rather high and some were kept in their natural form \u2013 something that we are used to seeing. Then there were variations in jacket lengths. There were cropped jackets, waist coats, bandhgalas and sherwanis with lengths kissing your knee and with high slits so that one can see the drama at the bottom. It was a jacket-focused collection and textures were very tone-on-tone. There was a hint of understated luxury throughout the collection,\u201d says Shantanu.

However, the cop on duty took prompt action to save the woman in the second case and helped his colleague arrest the accused app-cab driver who was allegedly stalking her. The incident assumes significance since police used a Twitter post from the woman to lodge an FIR and then arrested the driver from Kidderpore. The accused has been identified as Arun Patra. According to police, the woman had hailed an Uber cab from Behala No. 14 bus stand and was headed to the airport. Around 3.20am, her cab crossed Bailey Bridge and had taken Burdwan Road when it came close to another app cab being driven by Patra. \u201cThere was a point when the two cars almost collided. This angered Patra. He started following the car. A little ahead, near Laxmipat Singhania School, Patra even tried to block the car in which the woman was travelling. She raised an alarm but the accused reportedly did not budge. The driver of the Uber managed to wriggle out and sped towards Alipore zoo. By this time, the woman was frantically searching for a cop to seek help,\u201d said an investigating officer. She spotted ASI Biplab Das from Alipore police station, who was on night patrol, standing near the zoo. \u201cAround 3.40am, Das saw the cab stop near him. The woman got down and pointed towards the app cab and alleged that the driver of that car was following her. Before the ASI could do anything, the accused drove towards AJC Bose Road. However, the car returned on the same route a couple of minutes later and Das noted the registration number of the vehicle. The ASI then gave his phone number to the victim and her cab driver and asked them to call him if they needed any help. The woman, after reaching the airport, called the ASI to express her gratitude and also requested him take action against the driver,\u201d said DC (south) Meeraj Khalid. The cops pursued the case further, requesting the woman to send over a complaint. Expressing her gratitude, the woman iterated her ordeal on her Twitter handle. \u201cBased on her account and that of Das, an FIR was drawn under IPC sections 354D (molestation by following a woman to foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest by such woman) and 341 (wrongful restraint),\u201d said Khalid. On Wednesday, Patra, a resident of Sarsuna, was arrested. \u201cHe claimed that he was drunk and his only intention was to teach the other driver a lesson,\u201d said an officer. Cops are using CCTV footage from Alipore to reconstruct the crime. An Uber spokesperson said: \u201cThis is a clear violation of our \u2018community guidelines\u2019.

Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Link Failure at Garden Reach post Office": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/linkfailureatgardenreachpostoffice/articleshow/69818281.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Garbage remains dumped beside road": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/garbageremainsdumpedbesideroad/articleshow/69300019.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "RCB team 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rcb-team-2019-players-list-royal-challengers-bangalore-team-2019/articleshow/67151637.cms", "time": "", "description": ""}, "Shiv Sena List 2019": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/shiv-sena-announces-21-lok-sabha-candidates-for-maharashtra/articleshow/68523309.cms", "time": "", "description": "MUMBAI: Shiv Sena has come up with it's first list of 21 candidates, out of 23 to contest in Lok Sabha polls in Maharashtra.

This is the first time that Singh has to operate against the state administration in North 24 Parganas with Kankinara as the epicentre. But the month-long violence at a place only 43 kilometres from the state headquarters in Kolkata defies the Trinamool narrative of putting all the blame on the Barrackpore MP. Peace-loving residents have started asking if Arjun Singh is on one side of the confrontation, who is on the other side. For, things shouldn\u2019t have reached such a point despite the political change in the area. Singh took away with him most of the votes he had polled when he was with the Trinamool. He had polled 59,253 votes when he fought for the Bhatpara assembly seat in 2016 on a Trinamool ticket. His son Pawan polled 58,119 votes in the 2019 Bhatpara assembly bypolls, showing that Singh\u2019s support base remained more or less the same despite the change in his political loyalty. However, with the shift, the tools of political domination started working: colours of party offices changed from green to saffron and the ranks who serve as cogs in the party machinery that thrives on proceeds from \u201cbuilding material supply\u201d and commission from jute mill labourers shifted loyalty as well. The Barrackpore MP has a near monopoly in the coolie lines on one side of the Ghoshpara Road that provide the muscle power he needs. Some of these jute mill workers had shouted Jai Shri Ram during chief minister Mamata Banerjee\u2019s visit to Bhatpara in early June, and they are the ones who had blocked the Station Road area when Trinamool seniors \u2014 Jyotipriya Mullick, Nirmal Ghosh, Tapas Ray and Madan Mitra had gone on a visit to the area on June 2. During the last one month, Arjun Singh has tightened his grip on the civic bodies in the area. His son is the Bhatpara MLA, his nephew Saurav Singh is Bhatpara Municipality chairman and his brother-in-law Sunil Singh is Noapara MLA and Garulia Municipality chairperson. Sunil\u2019s son Aditya Singh had joined BJP earlier. Also, many Trinamool councillors from Bhatpara, Kancharapara, Naihati, Halisahar and Garulia civic bodies have joined the BJP. The saffron surge in the city\u2019s backyard has made the ruling Trinamool desperate to break the BJP\u2019s rise in the Barrackpore area that is helping BJP make forays into bordering Nadia. Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee tried to halt BJP\u2019s advance by consolidating other communities in the area. Taking the cue, police apparently went on an overdrive and conducted night raids in the locality, antagonising sections of the local population. \u201cPolice are targeting BJP supporters in the area and slapping serious charges on them. But they are not so keen on booking the culprits who killed BJP supporter Chandan Shaw after the Lok Sabha results,\u201d said state BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu. Trinamool\u2019s North 24 Parganas president and minister Jyotipriya Mullick accused the Barrackpore MP of bringing revolvers from outside. \u201cSingh\u2019s men had opened fire on the 16-year-old,\u201d he said. Arjun Singh, on the other hand, put the blame on the police. \u201cHe was killed in police firing. The bullet hit him on the back of his head,\u201d he said. The Barrackpre MP charged the TMC of rallying anti-socials from outside with police help. The agitation of women from a particular community in front of the police station before the violence was enough indication that things were turning for the worse. Realising the gravity of the situation, the government has clamped Section 144 in the area. The state BJP was quick to take up the \u201cKankinara police killing\u201d with their seniors in Delhi. \u201cWe are sending a BJP delegation to the place. We will send a report to the Union home ministry,\u201d said BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya. TMC\u2019s Tapas Ray wanted parties to end violence and rise up to the clamour for peace. \u201cThe CM is trying her best to restore peace in the area. The BJP, it seems, is in a haste to grab power in Bengal. The party is not ready to wait for the assembly polls,\u201d Ray said.

Apart from the five medical colleges and hospitals of the city, the other teaching hospitals in the districts, too, have been given nodal officers from Swasthya Bhawan. While the police will look into the access control at all gates, no illegal parking will be allowed near the hospitals. Swasthya Bhawan, the state health headquarters, on Wednesday also issued an order, giving the medical superintendent-and-vice principal (MSVP) at each hospital the authority to lodge a police complaint in case of vandalism or assault on doctors.

The team is expected to find out security loopholes at the establishments, such as lapse in access control, and look for room for improvement by checking if more space can be created in the emergency wards, better security can be implemented, more CCTV cameras can installed and if there is a need for augmentation in the existing private security services.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

What if they stop the car and drag me out? How will I save myself? Who can I approach for help? My nervous mind stops working. I feel vulnerable. I remember a couple of such incidents. In the first, my car was waiting at the signal at Esplanade when two bikes stopped beside it. The men kept staring at me while singing some cheap numbers as long as I waited at the signal. I was petrified. I moved to the middle of the rear seat, rolled up the car windows and prayed for a safe ride. But till date, I can\u2019t forget how insecure I felt that night. Another incident I remember was during a festival. My car was stuck at Anwar Shah Road and the road was chock-a-block with revellers. I was seated behind the driver. A little scared, I was about to pull up the window when a guy stuck his head in. His face was right in front of me. Shuddering in fear, I hurried to the other side of the car. Similar incidents have happened multiple times, and its worse during festivals when road romeos become more daring. I feel lucky to be safe. But what about the panic and helplessness I have to encounter? Every time I face such an incident, the first thing I look for is the nearest police station. I also try to remember if any of my friends or colleagues lives nearby so that I can call for help. What if the traffic cop on duty doesn\u2019t help me? What will be the last resort? Jumping out of the car and running for my life? It makes me angry that women have to face such experiences every other night. Why must we go through all this? Why can\u2019t I feel safe while driving back home at night? Why can\u2019t I enjoy the rain on my way back, not bothering about how many bikes or cars are there on the road? I don\u2019t have any answer.

Police have also announced a host of measures \u2014 including late-night naka checks across the city and issuing a standard operating procedure (SOP) on how to deal with a complainant on the street \u2014 to ensure a repeat of similar incident does not happen. The departmental inquiry initiated in this case \u2014 led by DC (south) Meeraj Khalid \u2014 has established that prima facie, sub-inspector Piyush Kumar Bal of the Charu Market police station had told Sengupta to approach the Bhowanipore police to lodge her case. Similarly, assistant sub-inspector Partha Chatterjee (who responded to the desperate calls of the model but allegedly told her the area where she raised the alarm came under Bhowanipore police station) and sub-inspector Milan Majumdar of Bhowanipore police (who felt there was no incident to bear out a case at Exide Crossing even when Sengupta and the driver were being harassed) have been show-caused. The police brass has decided to create an SOP that will deal with complainants seeking help on the road or those approaching a police station under which the crime did not take place. \u201cThe cop who responds first will ensure the case gets reported at the police station concerned. The reaction time will be monitored,\u201d said a police officer. In another major decision announced by additional CP Jawed Shamim, local police will work in tandem with traffic police to carry out night nakas at different locations. \u201cThe surprise element has to be maintained. We are expecting to carry out these nakas between 10pm and 1.30am,\u201d said an officer. Police are at a final stage of implementing sensor cameras that can trigger alarms at the control room if something grossly wrong is detected. The decisions were taken at a meeting of senior officers, which was chaired by commissioner Anuj Sharma. \u201cJust as we took hard decisions and replaced the additional OC of Entally police and the NRS outpost chief after the NRS assault case, or replaced the river traffic in-charge after the magician\u2019s death, we wanted to send a strong message after the this case as well. Action will be taken immediately if the safety of women is compromised,\u201d said an officer. Meanwhile, police on Wednesday got the custody of the seven men arrested so far for being involved in this case. The cops will be questioning them till June 21. Public prosecutor Parthasarathy Mukherjee said it was needed because they wanted to arrest three others who are still absconding. \u201cThe accused will know their whereabouts. In addition, we will need to carry out a reconstruction of the incident. A few more bikes will also be seized through their help,\u201d he said. Police on Wednesday also prayed for recording the confidential statement of Sengupta before a magistrate. Sources said the prayer has been granted.
