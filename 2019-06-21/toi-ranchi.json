Around 50 school bus drivers participated in the day-long event held at the district transport office here on Friday. The programme focused on educating the drivers and attendants about safety parameters. Apart from that, the participants were also given an account of school transportation guidelines issued by the Central Board of Secondary Education. The day-long training was conducted by Ankur Mathur, who primarily zeroed in on blind spot detection, lane driving, road signage familiarisation and turning rules. \"School bus drivers usually have lot of experience, but most of them lack adequate knowledge of traffic rules and that is why they need to update themselves. Before conducting the training, we tested their knowledge of traffic rules and found that only 20% were aware of the guidelines. However, most scored between 70-80% after attending the workshop,\" Mathur said. The drivers and attendants were also issued certificates after completion of the training programme. A few drivers raised the issue of time management, which they face on a daily basis. \"I have been driving school bus for the last 12 years and have witnessed the change in city traffic. Ten years ago, it was easier to get back to school in time after dropping kids, but with the rampant growth of traffic it has become a herculean task. If we miss the deadline, we are taken to task by the school management. How can a driver concentrate on safety parameters when he is under pressure to conform to school timings,\" a driver working with a reputed CBSE school in capital city said. When contacted, the joint transport commissioner of road safety, Ravishankar Vidyarthi, said that the programme was organised in order to make roads safe for school kids. Vidyarthi also took cognizance of the issues raised by drivers and said: \"The concerns raised by the drivers are valid and I will look into the problems.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "After last Friday namaz before Eid, shoppers throng markets": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/after-last-friday-namaz-before-eid-shoppers-throng-markets/articleshow/69608634.cms", "time": "2019-06-01 12:52:00", "description": "RANCHI: With 'Alvida Jumma' - the final Friday of the holy month of Ramzan - over, preparations for Eid-ul-Fitr are now in full swing in the city markets.

After the iftar, the street-side markets on the stretch between Kali Mandir Chowk and Iqra Masjid was abuzz with activity as shoppers came out in large numbers. The traffic on this route has already been diverted. Sale of the staple food during Ramzan - dry fruits - has taken quite a hit this year due to the scorching heat. Instead of buying cashews and raisins, people for watermelons, mangoes and other seasonal fruits, the shopkeepers said. \"This year, Ramzan will be observed in the peak of summer and hence, the shoppers prefer hydrating food items.

They are priced anything between Rs 10 and Rs 80 a piece, depending on the size and also the ingredients.\" Many shops have also stocked up imported 'Itars', with the pricier varieties pegged at Rs 1,000 for a bottle - both in edible and daily use varieties for the festival.

While the Left parties have time and again questioned the authenticity of EVMs, regional parties of Jharkhand, which are currently confronting existential crisis, have also echoed similar concerns. Two weeks ago, JVM-P led by former chief minister Babulal Marandi voiced in favour of ballot papers. On Sunday, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), the principal opposition party in the state, also resolved to press for use of ballot of papers during its recent central committee meeting. JMM working president Hemant Soren said, \"The authenticity of the Election Commission and the polls have increasingly come under question. In such a situation, we demand that all elections henceforth, including the upcoming assembly elections, be done on ballot papers.\" On the 2019 Lok Sabha polls verdict, Soren said, \"The results makes us raise more questions on EVMs. Just sometime back, someone was telling me about a news report in a national magazine which did an RTI-based story highlighting how 20,000 EVMs went missing. Moreover, after every big occasion, say a big festival, there is often a great enthusiasm among public for days. But after the our election festival, I couldn't sense any happiness among the masses.\" RJD - another constituent of the opposition's mahagatbandhan during general elections in the state, echoed similar sentiments. RJD's state president Abhay Singh said they will submit a fresh memorandum to the EC demanding use of ballot papers. \"Jharkhand is a small state. Why not experiment with ballot paper this time in assembly polls? This will give a clear idea between authenticity of EVMs and ballot papers,\" he said, adding that RJD has long been demanding this. Congress, the grand old party and another key constituent of the grand alliance, however, towed a different line. \"Our stand is simple. Rather than blaming EVMs, it's time everyone works on the ground to make an impact in the election,\" a senior Congress leader and party spokesperson Alok Dubey said. Meanwhile, BJP isn't surprised with the ballot chorus. \"EVM is good when results are in favour, but bad when you lose. That's the hypocrisy of parties which prefer doing opportunistic politics. BJP believes in development-based politics and sanctity of constitutional bodies,\" party spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said.

Recently, septuagenarian Namita Chatterjee was taking an evening walk in front of her house in Sonari when three bike-borne goons came from behind and snatched her chain. Chatterjee fell when the pushed her and broke her arm. Neighbours took the bleeding old lady to TMH. Namita had to be operated upon and was confined to bed for nearly four months. She refused to lodge a complaint with the police. Similarly, Manju Kar, who is in her sixties and also lives in Sonari, was targeted by bike-borne snatchers near her home. Manju talking to TOI narrated how she was stopped by the goons and her chain was snatched. Manju's daughter Chaitali Kar, who lives in Australia with her family and had come down to her ancestral house with her children, too fell victims of this snatching gang. She was attacked near busy Kagalnagar market area. Chaitali said goons came on a bike and snatched her purse. Chaitali had to approach the police to lodge a complaint, as she lost her debit cards and mobile phone. Another woman was robbed of her ornaments in Sonari on knife-point, when she was out on the road in the early hours to get milk from the booth. Due to the shrinking job market, many youths from the Steel City are moving to other places leaving behind their old parents. Taking advantage of this situation goons are now target senior citizens and women. Though these types of attacks were common in most parts of the city, a study revealed that most of the chain snatching and house loot incidents are taking place in areas under Sonari and Kadma police stations, which are under Jamshedpur West assembly segment. When BJP MLA saryu Rai, the local lawmaker, was contacted, he said CM Raghubar Das is the home minister too, and he should pay attention to this problem. City SP Prabhat Kumar, instead of going into the details of the problem and having sympathy for senior citizens, tried to gauge the gravity of the situation by records. He said those incidents which are not reported to police are \u201cno incidents\u201d. Meanwhile, residents of the affected area said Sonari police station office incharge is not cooperative and is always reluctant to register cases terming them to be petty crimes. During Raghubar's recent visit, the CM came down heavily on the city SP at the Sonari aero-drome over the rise in crime graph in the Steel City. Residents allege that Tiger Mobiles (police on bikes) and PCR vans patrolling in the city area are of no use. \u201cThey are more interested getting bribes from builders, engaged in illegal construction in Tata Steel lease area, rather than giving security to the common man,\u201d said Manoj Singh, an ex-officer of Tata Steel. Former state minister from Congress Banna Gupta too echoed similar sentiments and came down heavily on the poice administration for not able to give protection to women and senior citizens. Gupta too said police are more interested in making money than giving security, which is their prime job. Though he did not want to name to corrupt officers, he said a section of the cops are hands in glove with the illegal matka, gambling den operators. He said crime in city can not be controlled unless illegal bars, gambling and drug dens are uprooted with an iron hand.

Contrary to the apprehensions, commuters faced no problems as both private and public vehicles plied normally. A few schools and institutions that remained open also functioned normally. All petrol pumps too stayed opened. In the morning, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) workers along with members of Kendriya Sarna Samiti and other tribal outfits took out a peaceful procession at Albert Ekka chowk. Members of Left parties too staged a protest at the same venue. They were arrested and sent to camp jail in Morhabadi thereafter. SSP Anish Gupta said the bandh passed off peacefully. \"A total of 168 people were arrested and the protests were peaceful. We had written to all leaders to refrain from any kind of violence and warned them of strict action as per Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian penal code,\" he said. Amar Kumar who runs a book shop on Pustak Path near Shaheed Chowk, said: \"I was a bit hesitant to open my shop in the morning. However, before noon I saw that protests were peaceful and there was no threat to property and I decided to open my shop.\" Meanwhile, Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) repaired the statue on priority basis late on Friday night. Deputy mayor Sanjeev Vijayavargiya, who arranged the logistics for the repairs, said, \"The material required to repair the statue was brought from Kolkata to Jamshedpur on train. From there we brought it to Ranchi by road on priority basis.

He also warned field officers of stringent action if they are found to be \"indifferent\" towards the problems of the people. He said that the mindset of police at district and the police station levels should be more public-friendly. The steps taken to close the gap between police and the public would be an important aspect of assessing the performance of SP's and the officers-in-charge of police stations. \"Instead of fearing to visit the police station in emergency, people should regard the state force as friend and a help. Police should register FIR on compliant even if the issue may be small. I will take entire responsibility for sharp rise in cases in such circumstances.

He said, \"Extremists who are disenchanted by functioning of their organisation are welcome to surrender under state government's policy. The police would, however, verify whether the person is genuinely an ultra or a pretender laying down arms before police merely to take benefits of government schemes.\" He opined that ensuring an eco-system for development, which would also attract the people towards the social mainstream, is another important way to reduce extremism. \"Police would play important role in creating environment for implementation of welfare projects,\" he said. On cyber crime, he observed it was a challenging issue with a few districts becoming ill-famed across the country for such activities. \"State police would train its personnel to deal with this crime and if needed resource persons would be roped in from outside the state to handle the situation. We have to remain a step ahead of cyber criminals and LWE situation in state,\" he stated.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Sources also said Ajoy Kumar could be fielded from the Jamshedpur West seat. A section of district Congress functionaries feels that if Ajoy refuses to contest from the seat, a leader from the minority community should be the Congress nominee. District Congress president Vijay Khan talking to TOI on Monday confirmed that a section of functionaries from the party\u2019s Jamshedpur West segment wants Ajoy to contest from the seat. Jamshedpur West seat has a sizeable Muslim population. It may be mentioned here that Jamshedpur Lok Sabha has six assembly segments \u2014 Jamshedpur West, Jamshedpur East, Jugsalai, Potka, Ghatshila and Baharagora. Sources said district Congress also decided that if there is no tie-up, Congress would contest on all seats. Interestingly, the former state minister and former Jamshedpur West MLA from Congress, Banna Gupta, a known face in the party, was absent from the meeting. Absence of Gupta led to a lot of speculation, as after the party\u2019s recent Lok Sabha poll debacle Gupta had questioned the leadership of state Congress head Ajoy Kumar. After this, district president Khan had sought disciplinary action against Gupta for questioning the leadership of Kumar in public.

Party president Amit Shah held a two-day meeting of party in-charges of Jharkhand, Haryana and Maharashtra on June 13 and 14. During the meeting, Shah set a target for BJP to win 65 seats own its own in the 81-member Jharkhand assembly. BJP heads the NDA government in Jharkhand with Ajsu-P as its partner. State BJP president Laxman Gilua told TOI, \u201cTo speed up the development work, both the state and the Centre have to work hand in hand.\u201d He said the need of the hour is the \u201cdouble engine\u201d government \u2014 same party rule both at the Centre and the state \u2014 so that there are no speed breakers on the road to development. Highlighting the achievements of the current NDA government-led by Raghubar Das in the state, Gilua said all-round development of the state in the next five years will be possible as there will be the \u201cdouble engine\u201d government, too. Recounting his recent meeting in Delhi with Shah, Gilua said all efforts would be made to get 65+ seats. He said similar measures taken up during the the Lok Sabha polls, like making every party functionary play an active role in the polls, would be replicated for the state polls. He added booth-level committees would be strengthened so that party can improve its tally in every booth. The meeting with Shah was attended by Jamshedpur MP Bidyut Baran Mahato, state poll in-charge Mangal Pandey and several party big wigs apart from Gilua. In the recent polls, BJP won 12 out of 14 Lok Sabha seats in state and vote share indicated that party is ahead in 63 assembly seats. In the 2014 state polls, BJP and its ally Ajsu-P bagged 42 seats, just one more than simple majority in the House. Giula said going ahead with this calculation, BJP wants to improve its tally to 65 plus seats. On alliances with other parties, Gilua said Ajsu-P is already an ally and the tie-up would continue. Commenting on JD(U), Gilua said, \u201cWe are partners in Bihar and at the Centre.\u201d He indicated the possibility of joining hands for the state polls with the Nitish Kumar-led party. Gilua, however, refused to comment if BJP would fight the state polls with Raghubar Das as chief ministerial face. He said each and every person in the party is equally important so a chief ministerial candidate is not an issue.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

Between 2014 and 2017, at least 4,466 lives were lost in NH accidents across Jharkhand, while the number of road accident-related fatalities in the same period across state highways is 3,510. The number of total accidents in the state every year close to about 5,000 during the last four-year period and the highest number of deaths occurred in 2017 with 3,256 casualties out of a total of 3,034 fatal accidents in the state during the year. In 2018, the number of deaths saw a marginal drop of 4.7% with the number reducing to 3,104 deaths. Even though the number of accidents between 2014 and 2017 have not increased, the total fatalities have spiked from 2,628 in 2014 to 3,256 in 2017. The number of deaths in accidents on National Highways have also seen a steep increase from 669 in 2014 to almost double in 2017 at 1,250. According to a district transport department official, a total of 654 road accidents took place in which 300 people died in 2018 in Ranchi. Out of all the total number of victims, over 300 sustained grievous injures. In 2019, though the data is yet to be tabulated, but the official said on an average, anywhere between 45-50 accidents are being reported every month in which the casualty rate is 50%. Outlining the reason for the high fatality, city-based road safety activist Rishab Anand said, \u201cThere are two factors that make accidents on the National Highway more fatal than the state highways. One is the common notion that NH is built for speeding and that results in fatal accidents. Second is the comparatively lower accessibility to medical facilities in the crucial hours following the accident on the highway which also ends up costing much more lives.\u201d The issue has already come as a concern for the state government with chief secretary D K Tiwari recently instructing the departments concerned for deployment of ambulances equipped with GPS and other connectivity tools with the nearest police station for every 50 km on national highways across the state. \u201cThe goal is to cut down on the number of road accidents in the state in half by 2020. More highway patrolling and effective use of cameras to crack down on rash drivers is equally crucial,\u201d Tiwari said, stressing on the extra effort made on the 146 \u201cblack\u201d spots identified on the state and National Highways in the state.

Jharkhand JD (U) chief Salkhan Murmu said on Thursday that he would submit a proposal to Nitish the proposed meeting of the national executive committee to be held in Patna on June 9. \u201cMy proposal is based on logic and not merely on expectations,\u201d he said. Murmu said the JD (U), which is part of the ruling NDA in Bihar and also at the Centre, has already started preparations for the assembly election in Jharkhand and meetings of party workers are being held at divisional and district levels at regular intervals. \u201cWe are getting feedback from our workers at the grass roots level. But the national president will take a final call on the matter whether to go solo or with alliance partner,\u201d Murmu told this newspaper over phone. He, however, said the party is gearing up to contest all the 81 seats, if the situation arises so. The recent development at the centre when the party was offered only one symbolic ministerial berth in PM Narendra Modi-cabinet has compelled the leadership of the party to be ready for similar situation in Jharkhand. He said the JD (U) may provide an alternative to the tribals, who are no more inclined to the main opposition JMM-Congress combine. \u201cThe disenchantment of the tribals towards JMM-Congress combine can be gauged from the fact that JMM chief Sibu Soren lost the recently concluded Lok Sabha election. The JMM, which claimed to have championed the cause of the tribals, ruled over the state for three terms. But what did the tribals get from the JMM led government? They feel deceived by all parties,\u201d the Jharkhand chief said. He said even the BJP has failed to garner the support of the tribals as desired. The BJP won the two tribal (reserved) Lok Sabha seats\u2014Khunti and Lohardagga\u2014with a thin margin. Besides, out of the 14, the BJP-AJSU combine bagged 11 and one seat respectively. The issues of tribal locals and non-tribal locals will also dominate the electoral scene, which will go in favour of the party, he added. Above all, the JD (U) will project Nitish Kumar\u2019s development model for the people of Jharkhand as well. \u201cBoth the JMM-Congress and the BJP have ruled the state ever since it came into existence. But they have not come up to the expectations of the majority of the people. Moreover, people belonging to minority community will prefer the JD (U) instead of other parties because of its clear stand on secularism,\u201d the state president added. Meanwhile, JD (U) secretary general KC Tyagi said the party would submit a proposal to Arunachal Pradesh (AP) speaker for staking claim on the portfolio of Leader of Opposition in the AP legislative assembly, where BJP is in majority. He said though the JD (U) will support the BJP government but it is the rightful claimant for having its leader of Opposition as it has seven MLA, the second largest chunk in the 60- member assembly in Arunachal Pradesh. Tyagi, however, added that if Pema Khandu-led BJP government in AP will extend proposal for induction of JD (U) MLAs in his cabinet of minister, then JD (U) will readily accept it. \u201cIf the BJP government in AP sends invitation to us, then we would have no issues in becoming a part of the government. Our main motto is to keep the NDA strong,\u201d he said. BJP and JD (U) contested the assembly elections in AP separately held on April 11. While BJP won 41 seats and formed the government, JD (U) with winning seven out of 15 seats it contested, became the second largest party.

Addressing a meeting in Guntur on Monday, Pawan said that the future of the state did not mean the future of Lokesh and Jagan but it was the future of the people. \u201cThe space on the state\u2019s political stage is not TDP\u2019s and YSRC\u2019s property as youth and women are eager to bring change through Jana Sena.\u201d \u201cTDP had lost moral right to rule the state as chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had no control over his legislators who indulged in illegal activities,\u201d Pawan said adding that he jumped into the political arena to bring in a change in the lives of commoners. \u201cWe supported TDP and BJP in the last elections with a hope to transform the state. Unfortunately, both of them have shattered our dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cGuntur city has been left in a lurch despite located a few kilometres away from the capital city. The entire city has been dug out in the guise of laying underground drainage scheme and left without repair. How shocking it is to see 30 people dying of diarrhoea in a city like Guntur? Is it not the failure of the state government? Opposition leader Jaganmohan Reddy is equally responsible for the tragedy as he never dared to question the government by going to the assembly,\u201d he said. He further said they would construct apartments exclusively for Muslims in the city. He appealed to people to support his candidates Chandrasekhar (Guntur West), Zia-Ur-Rehman (East) and MP candidate Bonaboina Srinivas Yadav in the elections, Pawan said they fielded a BC candidate Srinivasa Yadav whereas TDP and YSRC both have given tickets to their own communities.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

In sync with Centre\u2019s guidelines to streamline the real estate sector, Jharkhand notified RERA in 2017 after devising its own rules in tune with Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016. Since then, sources told TOI that two advisories were served to real estate promoters, building and developers for seeking compulsory registration of their works. However, vis-\u00e0-vis the massive construction boom in Ranchi and elsewhere in the state, the response so far has been unsatisfactory. \u201cTherefore, we are now giving a final three month window to all such erring building/promoters to register their projects with us failing which the Authority will initiate crackdown,\u201d said Niraj Kumar Srivastava, chief administrative officer of RERA, Jharkhand. On the nature of punitive action, he said, \u201cUnder section 3(1) of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016, more than 50 percent of the cost of registration will be charged on each builder/developer besides other legal actions enshrined under the rules.\u201d Figures available from the Authority suggested that so far 100 projects have been registered with RERA across the state. \u201cBut the number of ongoing projects could be several times more as the Authority has been receiving regular complains from aggrieved customers. Registration of the projects will also serve as a database of the projects underway in the state,\u201d he added. Another official, on anonymity, said that the reason why RERA hasn\u2019t considered crackdown until now is because of logistical and administrative issues. \u201cAfter notification of RERA, it took some time for it to become fully functional due to manpower issues, formation of a tribunal and appellate for hearing and disposal of cases etc. Now, with all those ground works over, focus is on to strengthen and streamline its functioning to meet its objective with which it is formed,\u201d said another official. According to Srivastava, they have also started taking hearing on complaints from aggrieved parties. So far 70 cases have been registered, mostly from customers who invested in real estates. \u201cHearings are underway to dispose them. Recently, as many as 10 people (customers) lodged complaints against a company named Ananya construction for failing to give them their houses on time. We had imposed heavy fines on the said building,\u201d he said, but couldn\u2019t specify the amounts.

Last year, the Centre had announced a new approach to rejuvenate nine key rivers in the country- Ganga, Yamuna, Bhramaputra, Krishna, Cauvery, Godavari, Mahanadi, Narmada and Tapi. However, none from this mineral rich state was included. At a meeting headed by Das at Project Bhavan, the CM pressed for the inclusion of the two rivers in the state. Jharkhand chief secretary DK Tiwari told reporters, \"We have requested the Niti Aayog team to include these two rivers with CAMPA so that they can be effectively rejuvenated. They have given us a positive assurance.\" Talking to TOI, chief minister's secretary Sunil Barnwal said Jharkhand contributes 8% to CAMPA funds annually. But the funds that are being utilised to conserve 9 river basins nationally aren't benefitting this state. \"Of the nine basins, only Mahanadi (river basin) work slightly benefits Jharkhand as barely 0.18% patch of the river touches Jharkhand via Kolhan through different tributaries. On the contrary, we have two crucial rivers - Damodar and Subarnarekha, which need urgent attention. So, we have apprised the team with our concerns,\" he said. Damodar originates near Padma in Hazaribagh district and flows through different parts of Jharkhand before entering Dishergarh in West Bengal. On the other hand, Subarnarekha originates near Piska Nagri in Ranchi and traverses through Seraikela-Kharsawan, East Singhbhum before crossing paths in two directions to enter Bengal and Odisha. The state has also requested for linking Jharkhand's key roads with Centre's ambitious Bharatmala Pariyojana. \"We have requested the team to link four lane road network from Sahebganj district connecting key towns like Bokaro-Dhanbad-Jamshedpur till Dhamra port (Odisha) with Bharatmata Pariyojana. This will be a 740km road network for which we sought central assistance,\" another official said. The Niti Aayog team headed by its vice-president Rajiv Kumar arrived in Jharkhand on Tuesday. After visiting Jharia coal fields region in Dhanbad on Tuesday, the team reached Ranchi on Wednesday to meet CM Das and his team. Other members of the visiting team are additional secretary RP Gupta, advisors Niraj Kumar & Alok Kumar and joint secretary Harendra Kumar. Chief secretary Tiwari said the meeting was fruitful. \"We discussed at length on various issues for overall development of Jharkhand with special emphasis on health and education sectors. The team appreciated our efforts and assured all cooperation,\" Tiwari said. The Niti Aayog vice-president acknowledged the state government's efforts towards various development initiatives.

Talking to TOI on Thursday, JREDA director Niranjan Kumar said that in the last one year, they could barely produce two mega-watt solar energy through this scheme owing to various issues. \"So far, 100 solar rooftop units were set up in residential/commercial areas across the state, with majority of the chunk being in Ranchi. This year, we have set a target of generating five mega-watt solar power through this scheme,\" Kumar said talking on the sidelines of the unveiling ceremony of Tata Power Solar's residential solar rooftop campaign titled #Pledge at the JREDA office in Doranda. Kumar said that as per their policy, a 50% subsidy is given to those who wish to set up solar rooftop systems. The Centre gives 30%, while 20% is borne by the state government. The rate of solar rooftop unit varies depending on its capacity. \"There are two components to it - battery and the solar device. Subsidy is given on the latter. The best part is that if you have extra power, you can sell it to the government. So whoever installs it, can reach breakeven point in 3-3.5 years. The life of each solar rooftop unit is 25 years,\" he said. The reason for slow response to this unique scheme is mainly because of lack of awareness among the public, Kumar said. There are a few other technical hurdles too, which the state government is currently working upon. \"A net meter is fixed at every point where solar rooftop is fixed. The job of the meter is to analyse the consumption of normal power vis-a-vis solar so that billing can be adjusted. Jharkhand Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited, the state's power distribution company, is in the process of streamlining these meters with their billing system. In the next couple of months, the issue will be sorted out,\" he said.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's congratulatory letter after he assumed office for the second time, PM Narendra Modi wrote back on June 12 expressing India's desire to have normal and cooperative relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, while stressing that \"for this, it is important to build an environment of trust, free of terror, violence and hostility\". Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Expressing concern that young people are becoming vulnerable to heart ailments, Modi said, \"Yoga can play a huge role in tackling the issue and hence, this year's theme is 'Yoga for Heart'.\" \"It is painful to read about alcoholism, substance abuse, diabetes and other things, adding yoga offers a solution to these problems,\" he added. He stressed that for yoga to become popular, infrastructure for it must be strengthened and said the government was working towards it. \"Peace and harmony are related to yoga. People across the world must practice it,\" Modi said. The prime minister had arrived in Ranchi on Thursday night. On his way out of the venue, Modi shook hands with several participants, including school children, who reached out to the prime minister over barricades.

It stated that a four-year undergraduate course, as proposed in the draft, would impose extra financial burden on students coming from economically weaker sections of society. Moreover, AISA pointed out that the draft does not have provisions for implementing the Right to Education (RTE) policy. Speaking to the media during the two-day national council of AISA in Ranchi, its national president Sucheta De said, \u201cThe four-year graduation course is based on education pattern of western countries. It would cause inconvenience to many students.\u201d She added, \u201cNEP does not have the provision for opening government schools in order to implement the RTE Act. On the other hand, the state government here is merging schools. The highest number of school merger has taken place in Jharkhand. In mountainous areas, it becomes difficult for a small child to attend school located at a distance.\u201d She added that AISA would raise the issue at different platforms in the days to come. Other students\u2019 body, such as National Students Union of India (NSUI), which is backed by Congress, and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, didn\u2019t wish to comment on the issue stating that they were yet to go through the draft proposal. Whereas academics gave a mixed reaction to the proposals. Prabhat Kumar Singh, an associate professor in sociology department of Ranchi University, said the four-year course would deter many youngsters from taking up undergraduate study. \u201cIt is true that people from poor families will struggle to bear the extra burden,\u201d he said. Dr Bansidhar Prasad of Vinoba Bhave University defended the four-year undergraduate course proposal, stating that under the present three-year system, most students remain unemployable at the end of college. \u201cAdding a year will be necessary for imparting quality education and improving the skills of students,\u201d he said.

Of the six who surrendered today, four are couples. While Pici Di is married to Sukhlal, Premshila is in relationship with Siddo and delivered a baby six months ago.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

Moreover, as the number of working parents increases, it has become even more difficult of them to make their children follow proper study hours. In view of the difficulties faced by the parents and guardians, schools in Ranchi have moved on from websites and introduced dedicated mobile applications for information dissemination. Most schools in the city now have their own android apps developed with a log-in feature for students and their parents to check attendance, marks obtained and extracurricular performance along with GPS tracking facility for school buses. While some of these apps are home grown by IT teams in the respective schools, some are developed through Delhi and Mumbai-based tech support agencies. In March this year, city-based Sarala Birla Public School introduced an app titled Gavaaksh, which is available on Google Playstore. The school\u2019s principal, Paramjeet Kaur, said, \u201cEverything from the attendance of a child to his or her marks scored in any examination are updated on the app for convenience of the parents. We also have a feature where every activity of a student in the school \u2014 be it a pat on the back for an extra-curricular achievement or an incident of indiscipline, is updated. This helps the parents to stay in touch with what is happening with their child right from their homes.\u201d Another prominent school \u2014 Oxford Public School \u2014 was one of the early schools to embrace this trend in mid-2018 by launching its own app named after the institute. Principal Suraj Sharma said the app is being developed by a Delhi-based firm and they are in the process of introducing a variety of new features. He said, \u201cSome of the aspects like teacher\u2019s login and bus tracking system among others are being explored to make this app more relevant for both the school and the parents.\u201d Many schools also have a separate mobile-based application for tracking their buses from the time they leave the campus till every students is safely dropped at his or her home. Sapphire International School admission counsellor, Kunal Prasad, said, \u201cThrough our online Vidyalaya app, parents can not only track their wards\u2019 performance in the school, but they can also locate the buses when they are out to drop the students through the GPS tracking system. It is a safety measure introduced for both the parents and the students with an intention to help the parents plan their pick-ups according to the location of the buses.\u201d Other schools like Bishop Westcott School (for boys and girls), Delhi Public School, Ranchi, and St Thomas School also have their dedicated apps introduced in the past one year to keep parents in the loop about their wards\u2019 activity and performance. Parents said these apps have made their lives easier. Ajay Rai, president of the Jharkhand Abhibhavak Manch, and father of two girls, said, \u201cIntroduction of such apps definitely has made the parent participation far more active and the student\u2019s school activity is much more transparent as now.

The department has requested the residents to send in their suggestions by post or mail till June 15,2019. To do so, people can drop their letters in the suggestion box at PWD office or write to 'Executive Engineer, PWD Sirpur Bhawan Campus, Behind Aakashwani' or send an e-mail to skywalkraipur@gmail.com between June 1 to June 15. The project, conceived and implemented during Raman Singh-led BJP regime, is almost complete. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel had hinted that the government would take public's opinion on the utility of the project. Congress had earlier opposed the Skywalk project at Shashtri Chowk - which was supposed to connect important roads at prime locations and easy congestion on the busy lane. Since its conception, the project has attracted criticism with residents call it a waste of public money. They complained, they preferred a flyover for regulating traffic instead of a massive ramp built for the pedestrians. The decision on the project had been pending due to the model code of conduct put in place due to the Lok Sabha elections. The estimated budget of Skywalk project is around Rs50 crore. While highlighting the disadvantage of the project, executive engineer of public works department said, \"The landing of the six lanes will obstruct roads and restrict the scope of road widening in the future.\" Earlier in a press conference held at Rajiv Bhawan, chief minister Baghel had said that the projects which do not have people's support, but are on the verge of completion need attention and detailed study. Talking to TOI, PWD Minister Tamradhwaj Sahu had said, \"Though the Skywalk was constructed for the use of pedestrians drew flak since its inception, hence we need time to address the issue and conclude its status of existence.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Day after blasts, 13 IEDs & detonators seized in Palamu": {"link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/day-after-blasts-13-ieds-detonators-seized-in-palamu/articleshow/69577322.cms", "time": "2019-05-30 13:36:00", "description": "RANCHI/DALTONGANJ: A day after 26 security personnel were injured in a series of IED blasts triggered by Maoists in Seraikela, 13 IEDs were recovered from a cave at Bagsara near Pipra's Seerniya Dam during a police-CRPF joint operation.

Talking TOI from Delhi on Thursday, Bidyut said: \u201cI have always worked for the development of Bengali, so taking oath in this language makes me feel proud. I studied at a Bengali-medium school and my parents too speak in the same language at home.\u201d He said his love for the language is not new. When he was a Baharagora MLA from JMM, he had taken oath in the assembly in Bengali. Mahato said large parts of Jamshedpur seat were earlier under the Manbhum south seat. He also said tribals living in this part of Jharkhand are very close to Bengalis and marriage between two are very common. He also promised that as an MP he would ensure that Bengali gets its due status in Jharkhand. Notably, Jamshedpur was carved out of Manbhum, which was a part of Bengal. In 1957, the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha constituency was created. Historians say at one time 96% population living in Manbhum spoke in Bengali. Senior orthopedic surgeon from TMH Indranil Bhaduri said: \u201cAs a probashi Bengali (Bengalis living outside Bengal), I was overjoyed to hear that our MP took oath in Bengli,\u201d adding that it would make Bengalis living here feel that their mother tongue is getting due respect. President of Jamshedpur Bengali Association Tapas Mitra also hailed Mahato\u2019s move. Mitra said Mahato has a soft corner for Bengali-speaking people living in and around Jamshedpur Lok Sabha constituency. Shatarupa Mukherjee, a student of mass communication at Jamshedpur Women's College and a first-time voter, also expressed pride. Members of the Jamshedpur Bengali Community, a Facebook group, was full of praise for the MP. Cutting across party lines noted city-based industrialist and once JVM-P candidate for Jamshedpur MP seat Bikas Mukherjee said Mahato has always ensured that Bangla as a language gets its due respect. Talking from Istanbul, Mukherjee, who is associated with city Bengali association and The Bengal Club expressed his happiness in this regard. Echoing similar sentiments, senior science teacher at Loyola School Debjyoti Bose, he felt great that Mahato took oath in Bangla and was confident that Bengalis living in this city for many generations would share similar feelings. Sougata Lahiri, born in Jamshedpur now working in Kolkata, said with the passage of time Bangla-medium schools had downed their shutters in the Steel City due to lack of students and non-availability of study material, but the move undertaken by Mahato raised hopes that the closed schools would be opened in the near future.

From organising street plays, to wearing helmets with placards in hand and raising slogans against West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, the doctors and students from across the state protested against the violence inflicted upon their counterparts at a state-run medical college in West Bengal. The agitators demanded a healthy and secure work environment from the government. Several undergraduate students, who participated in plays, highlighted the importance of doctors and their importance in serving the society. \u201cOn several occasions we receive patients who had undertaken medication from quacks for months and approach us at the end. It becomes very difficult to save such patients and then it becomes a reason for patient\u2019s kin to thrash us. We are only trying to send a message that we are doctors we aren\u2019t gods. Please don\u2019t punish us for saving a life as it happened at NRS Kolkata,\u201d said Smita Mishra, a third year MBBS student of RIMS Ranchi. Medicos from Jamshedpur\u2019s Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College and Hospital and Dhanbad\u2019s Pataliputra Medical College and Hospital also held demonstrations on their respective campuses. Around 6,000 patients were affected as outpatient departments, indoor services and elective operation theatres were shut across the state bringing health services to a standstill as doctors protested demanding security. Apart from government doctors, medicos at private hospitals too wore black badges on their arms and attended to patients in support of the protests. A candle march was taken out in the evening by doctors from the city at RIMS campus were medical professionals participated under the aegis of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Jharkhand chapter. General secretary of state IMA, Pradeep Kumar Singh said: \u201cWe have been demanding protection which is not only beneficial for doctors but also safeguards patients\u2019 rights, for past two years, but it is still stuck in the state legislative assembly. How can doctors feel secure if state government keeps on failing us?\u201d The protest saw maximum participation from junior doctors across the state and their main concern was they are always at the receiving end as they are the primary contact with the patients and their relatives. The doctors at Bokaro General Hospital who also participated in the protest spoke to TOI and raised their issues. \u201cWe look after patients round the clock as senior doctors only pay visits, but we get thrashed by patients\u2019 kin as it happened with the intern in the West Bengal hospital. Doctors are feeling threatened and that is affecting their morale in serving people,\u201d said Shweta, a junior doctor, at BGH. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}}
