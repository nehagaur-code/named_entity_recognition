Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

MMC and Fomento may each argue that the other is to blame for the crisis, but as per the concession agreement signed between the two, a copy of which is with TOI, both are equally at fault. If Fomento failed to put into operation the landfill at the site for safe disposal of inert, MMC never bothered to cart away the reject of the unprocessed waste as mandated in the agreement. Resultantly, the inert and the reject, both comprising nearly 60% of the incoming daily waste, landed atop the decades-old mountain of garbage. A source closely associated with the setting up of the plant told TOI that the concession agreement never mandated that MMC segregate the waste and instead entailed the task to be carried out by Fomento. Fomento argues that the non-segregation of waste was the failure behind the plant not working at an optimum level. And therein lies the rub. \u201cAs MMC failed to provide us with segregated waste, the reject (of unprocessed waste) were on the higher side. Despite many reminders from time to time, MMC failed to cart away the reject, and therefore, left with no option, this 35-40% of the waste, along with the inert (15-20% of the waste), would be piled atop the existing garbage dump,\u201d a company official said. Resultantly, the decades-old mountain of garbage, which was what was originally intended to be eliminated as per the agreement, kept on rising raising questions about the efficacy of the plant. \u201cThe MSW Rules 2016 that mandate segregation at source came into force only in 2016, while the concession agreement was signed in 2011. It\u2019s clear Fomento intends to fall back on the changes in rules to defend its failure,\u201d a source closely associated with the setting up of the plant told TOI. Moreover, MMC also failed to put in any monitoring mechanism to oversee the operations of the plant, as outlined in the concession agreement. \u201cThe MMC never bothered to reply to the correspondence made to it by Fomento, and mutely acted as per the dictates of Fomento. It\u2019s now paying the price for being a silent spectator, or rather turning its eye away from the irregularities at Sonsoddo,\u201d former chairperson of MMC Savio Coutinho, during whose tenure the concession agreement was inked, said. The foundation stone for the plant was laid on October 2, 2011. As per the original concession agreement, Fomento and IL&FS were to set up a 50-75 tonne per day capacity plant on design, build, own, operate and transfer (DBOOT) basis for a period of 25 years, at a cost of Rs 7.3 crore. However, sources said the plant never became fully functional as Fomento failed to make the landfill at the site operational. Inert, non-biodegradable residual matter of processed waste comprising 15-20% of the waste processed, had to be dumped here. The underbelly of the operations at Sonsoddo was exposed only after the recent fire at the dump. With locals protesting against more dumping of waste here, Fomento began piling the reject inside the plant until there was not enough space to handle incoming garbage. That was when Fomento blocked entry to MMC\u2019s garbage trucks since Monday, triggering the crisis. Spread over 15,000sqm and containing 1.5 lakh tonne of mixed waste \u2014 and still rising with every passing day \u2014 the dump has turned out to be a major challenge for the MMC and the government, as acknowledged by deputy chief minister Vijai Sardesai. The original proposal was to set up the plant after clearing one half of the garbage dump, while the remainder was to be capped with impermeable layers after screening the waste. \u201cGas wells would be constructed to take out methane and other gases formed inside. Peripheral roads will be built for material movement and inspection. The capped dump would have post-closure protocol to take care of the facility for 15 years and to monitor the leachate and gas production and to see that there is no harm to the environment,\u201d the plant\u2019s project proposal stated. However, this technical requirement was rendered redundant after MMC provided additional 57,700sqm land adjoining the existing garbage dump, for setting up the plant. Subsequently, Fomento came out with a proposal for scientific capping of the garbage dump, an idea that was, however, shot down by the Goa State Pollution Control Board citing environmental concerns. The change in location of the plant and the proposal for scientific capping of the garbage dump meant doing away with the necessity of segregating and treating the garbage dump. Though scientific capping of the garbage dump failed to materialise, the original idea of eliminating the old dump was conveniently relegated to the back-burner. A source well versed with the legal matters of MMC, requesting anonymity, expressed apprehensions that the recent developments at Sonsoddo could help Fomento leverage the situation to its advantage by forcing MMC to terminate the agreement, and consequently enter into litigation and claim substantial costs. \u201cNevertheless, it\u2019s imperative that the government intervene in the matter and salvage the situation in the interests of the city and its people. Waste management technology keeps on innovating every four-five years and thus, the technology employed at Sonsoddo plant appears to have been outdated. An innovative technological solution is what is needed at Sonsoddo,\u201d the source said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

For decades, Margao municipal council (MMC) has been dumping all kinds of waste at Sonsoddo. The untreated garbage caught fire in May and burned for days, emitting highly toxic gases. With the solid waste treatment facility at Saligao refusing to accept garbage from Panaji and Taleigao for nearly five months due to overloading of its multi-waste sorting plant, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) is on the lookout for its own facility. The Saligao plant now sorts and treats garbage only from Bardez and is being expanded to treat increasing quantities. The proposed expansion was symptomatic of faulty planning, Monserrate said. \u201cWhy build a capacity of just 100 tonne and then go for expansion? When we plan for Bainguinim we should plan for the requirement of more talukas,\u201d he said. The environment impact assessment (EIA) through National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has been completed for the Bainguinim site and a public hearing is likely to be conducted in the coming months, sources said. CCP had procured the land at Bainguinim for the plant, but the Manohar Parrikar-led government decided to hand over the project in 2017 to Goa Waste Management Corporation where the then chief minister was chairman. According to sources, the state government is looking at three agencies to execute the Bainguinim solid waste treatment facility \u2014 Goa Waste Management Corporation, Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation and Imagine Panaji. \u201cIf required, (BJP Calangute MLA) Michael Lobo should be made chairman of Goa Waste Management Corporation or he should be given more powers to get it done. The others seem preoccupied,\u201d Monserrate said. It\u2019s been over a decade that the Bainguinim site was proposed to take care of waste generated in Tiswadi, Ponda and Sattari. Though the CCP has a relatively strong system of waste collection and management, it requires a facility to tackle plastic, e-waste, construction debris and other forms of complex waste. \u201cI will take this issue up in the assembly,\u201d Monserrate said.

In many parts of the commercial capital, garbage lay around in overflowing bins and around them, until the MMC began clearing the piles late on Wednesday evening. Waste that is usually collected every morning was only lifted later in the day.  The problem started on Monday, when Fomento, the concessionaire of the solid waste management (SWM) plant, refused to accept incoming waste from MMC trucks for want of space inside the plant to accommodate it. Meanwhile, at Sonsoddo, the MMC has started clearing the waste from inside the shed on a war footing deploying large number of trucks and labourers for the exercise. A number of heavy earthmoving machines were also seen deployed at the site. Sources in the MMC said that while a portion of the shed has been cleared of the rejects accumulated therein, it will take some more days for completely moving rejects out of the shed. \u201cOut of more than 1,000 tonnes of reject accumulated inside the shed, over 20% of it has been cleared,\u201d a source in the MMC said. The reject taken out of the shed are now being dumped onto the existing garbage dump outside the plant. Incidentally, a fire broke out once again at the garbage dump Wednesday evening hampering the garbage-clearing exercise. \u201cSmoke had started billowing from the dump. One fire tender was used to extinguish it,\u201d a fire officer said. Fomento maintained that the entire volume of rejects needs to be moved out before any more waste can be treated at the plant. Meanwhile, in areas like Aquem and Borda where door-to-door collection wasn\u2019t done for three days, residents were left with no option but to dump their waste at convenient spots on nearby streets. People were seen taking their bins and garbage bags on their two-wheelers and dumping them at various spots around the town. By the time MMC began collecting waste on Wednesday, its resources fell woefully short. While some of the trucks were offloaded on the garbage dump outside the plant, several garbage-laden trucks were seen parked elsewhere waiting to be offloaded. \u201cThey didn\u2019t collect our waste for three days,\u201d said a senior citizen from Aquem. \u201cIt began to stink so I asked my neighbour to throw it at the corner of our street.\u201d The MMC gave each household two bins for wet and dry waste in 2015, but most began segregating only four days ago, when municipal workers asked them to do so. Some who began segregating stopped after the workers themselves mixed the waste while collecting it. Former MMC chairperson Savio Coutinho said that councillors have an important role to play. \u201cThey should personally visit households and ask people to segregate garbage,\u201d he said. \u201cCitizens are more likely to listen to their local councillor than the municipal worker who is often not a local and who may not speak the local language fluently.\u201d Even those residents of the town who went shopping weren\u2019t spared the stink. \u201cThe stench was unbearable,\u201d said Julia F from Malbhat, a market-goer. President of the New Market Traders Association, Vinod Shirodkar, alleged that the municipality was regular in collecting waste from hotels and restaurants, but meted out second-class treatment to the market and households. \u201cThe government continues to grant permissions to buildings in the vicinity of Sonsoddo,\u201d he said. \u201cConstruction activity is still on.\u201d MMC\u2019s exercise of scouting for places in Curtorim and Margao to segregate waste before transporting to the Sonsoddo plant continued on Wednesday. It has however, identified a place in Fatorda, sources said. Sonsoddo garbage plant caters to waste generated in Margao, Fatorda and Curtorim. Fomento has now insisted on only segregated waste to be brought at its Sonsoddo plant.

Beneficiaries will also get subsidy towards vehicle insurance and scholarships for their children, Goa Tourism Development Corporation chairman Dayanand Sopte told reporters here on Wednesday. He also asked the local cabbies to join GoaMiles for a month and experience its functioning. During the past few days, opposition to GoaMiles has grown with some altercations happening between tourist taxi operators and app-based drivers. \u201cThe Goa government has taken a firm decision to stand by the GoaMiles initiative in the interest of tourism in the state. The government will neither buckle down to any sort of pressure from vested interests nor to their demands to stop or scrap the app-based taxi service,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would urge local taxi operators who have not joined the initiative to sign up with GoaMiles, which is completing a year of successful operations this August, instead of standing on the sidelines protesting against it,\u201d Sopte said. The allegations by taxi operators against GoaMiles are baseless and out of sheer ignorance and jealously, as several of their former colleagues are doing extremely well after joiningit, he said. Enlisting the achievements of GoaMiles in the last year, the GTDC chairman said, \u201cOn commissioning the service in August 2018, the fleet has steadily risen from 55 vehicles to 1,400 cabs.\u201d The app-based taxi service which started with 1,500 trips per month touched around 14,000 trips in December 2018 and in June 2019, has recorded more than 20,000 trips per month. \u201cSimilarly, on an average, a taxi driver registered with GoaMiles earns around Rs 3,500 per day without having to lose on commission, which other app-based taxi services operating nationally charge,\u201d Sopte said. This figure is much more than what a non-GoaMiles driver earns in a day and the earning potential is directly proportional to the hard work put in by the driver. He said that GoaMiles is not an \u2018outsider\u2019. \u201cEven other app-based taxi services may not have as much local genes as much as GoaMiles has,\u201d Sopte said.

Asked by the media in the Parliament complex about his possible successor, Rahul crucially did not parry the question but answered that he was not the person to decide on the issue and that it was a task for the party. After weeks of anonymous claims, this was the first confirmation of his intent to quit as the AICC chief ever since he announced the decision at a closed-door meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25. While the apex body turned down the resignation, Congress insiders said that Rahul is insistent on leaving the top job and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade him to stay on. Lok Sabha poll fallout: Congress considers naming interim presidentEven before Rahul publicly declared his intent, there were indications that Congress was considering naming a working president or interim president at the head of a \"collegium\" of leaders. Names of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mukul Wasnik and Prithviraj Chavan have done the rounds as likely candidates. Rahul's insistence that no one from the Gandhi family should hold the post effectively rules out sister Priyanka. Take charge, douse fire in Cong: Moily tells Rahul GandhiRahul's brief remark comes at a time when the party is caught in a bitter blame-game with its data department under Praveen Chakraborty in the crossfire for \"misleading\" the leadership on the trends in the Lok Sabha elections. The attack has been sharp with allegations that the data itself was not reliable with Chakraborty's proximity to Rahul raising the question whether the \"feedback\" only served to strengthen the leader's inclination to target PM Narendra Modi's image. Meanwhile, Rahul met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel along with AICC state in-charge P L Punia for a political discussion on Thursday evening. Party leaders attach importance to the meeting given that he has been reluctant to interact with colleagues lately. However, Rahul's public attestation about quitting may make it difficult for AICC managers to sway his thinking. As it became apparent that he might actually refuse to relent, various proposals have been mooted to make decision-making a collective affair through a \"collegium\" so that Rahul returns to active presidency. There have also been suggestions that a working president could be appointed. The proposal for a collegium is rooted in Rahul's complaint that he has been working alone and the party leaders did not pull their weight behind him in the LS polls. He had aired his grievances at the now-famous CWC brainstorming called after the party failed to improve its performance, going from 44 to 52. However, Congress leaders said they would continue to make efforts to persuade Rahul. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot told TOI, \"Rahul has to remain the Congress president. He worked hard and fearlessly. Victory and defeat are part of polls.\" Gehlot warned if Rahul quits, Congress workers would either become inactive or leave the party.Sources say Rahul is hell-bent on quitting and has made it clear that none from the Gandhi family should be put at the helm of the Congress organisation.

According to statistics shared by the IMD, the monsoon usually arrives by June 6 and withdraws by October 8. But this time round, the arrival of the rains as late as June 20 was baffling.

Foreign minister S Jaishankar also wrote to his Pakistani counterpart S M Qureshi, again only in response to the latter's congratulatory letter, emphasising the need for an atmosphere \"free from the shadow of terror and violence\". The emphasis on the need for Pakistan to rein in terror as a pre-condition for re-engagement was in keeping with the stand which saw Modi refrain from engaging with Imran Khan at the just-concluded SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan. Yet, the Pakistani media chose to interpret the contents of the letters of Modi and Jaishankar as reflecting India's desire to re-engage. The foreign ministry in Delhi quickly scotched the suggestion. \"There was complete distortion and an attempt to peddle fake news (in the way it was reported). The letters only reiterated India's old position that it wants normal and cooperative relations with all countries in South Asia and that it was important to create an environment free of terror and violence for it. There was no mention of any sort of dialogue with Pakistan,\" said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that India will not be fooled by any cosmetic action against terror by Islamabad. Emphasising that both the letters were written in as per the \"established diplomatic practice\", Kumar said: \"In their messages, they have highlighted that India seeks normal and cooperative relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan.\" In his letter, Modi had said that India remained committed to operationalising early an \"all-year-round\" Kartarpur corridor. Touching upon it, Kumar said India had already held three technical-level discussions with Pakistan and was currently awaiting clarification from Islamabad over a few issues it had raised. Puzzlingly, later in the evening, Pakistan's foreign ministry, which had kept quiet through the day, also sought to play down the speculation about the import of the letters. While responding to a question, the spokesperson said, \"It was an established practice for the leadership to congratulate new office holders and for them to respond.\" \"Pakistan's position on the way forward in relations with India was clear and well-known and did not require repetition,\" said the spokesperson, adding that the \"vision of peace, progress and prosperity of South Asia could be advanced by peacefully resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu & Kashmir, and moving away from dynamic of confrontation to cooperation\". Earlier in the day, sources in the Pakistan foreign office had said that Modi and Jaishankar had responded positively to recent letters from their Pakistani counterparts by conveying New Delhi's desire to engage with all countries, including Pakistan, for elimination of terrorism and prosperity of the region. \"India has always prioritised peace and human development, and sought to maintain cordial relations with all regional powers,\" Modi and Jaishankar maintained, according to FO sources. Both leaders, according to FO sources, called for special attention on elimination of terrorism in the region and said the issue must be a core focus in all future talks. They have also appreciated sentiments from Pakistan in their letters, the FO sources added. Modi's letter was in response to a congratulatory letter from Khan in which he had underscored Pakistan's vision of working for \"durable peace and stability in South Asia with peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including J&K\".

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

Northern Karnataka and many parts of Maharashtra are yet to receive rainfall. In the coming few days such interior areas of the west coast will also receive rainfall,\u201d he added.

The complaint stated that Muslims from these areas have been burying their dead at the St Inez kabrastan since 1961, until September 2017 when the CCP stopped the burial of those outside its jurisdiction stating that there was limited space.

During a meeting last week, CCP commissioner Shashank Tripathi stated that Muslims only from Panaji, Taleigao and St Cruz would be permitted to bury their dead at the St Inez kabrastan due to lack of space.

D\u2019Souza, considered to be one of the finest officers in the state administration, served as additional secretary (finance) for over a decade, and also as additional secretary to the chief minister. He has now been posted as additional secretary (housing) with additional charge of director (training), Goa Institute of Public administration and Rural Development (GIPARD). This is the first major bureaucratic reshuffle of officers of the Goa civil services since chief minister Pramod Sawant took over the reigns of the state in March. Sources said that a few ministers had repeatedly complained against D\u2019Souza during the past one year, as he perused through proposals referred to his department with a fine-tooth comb. It had resulted in some objectionable proposals either being kept on hold or delayed. When Parrikar was at the helm, the complaints of these ministers were shown the bin. However, the demand for his ouster from the finance department grew considerably after Parrikar\u2019s demise. In February, some ministers, including health minister Vishwajit Rane and revenue minister Rohan Khaunte, had alleged at a cabinet meeting chaired by Parrikar at his private residence in Dona Pauala that D\u2019Souza was \u201cobstructing development\u201d by not clearing files. Sources said that Parrikar had specifically instructed the finance department not to clear files under pressure from his ministerial colleagues unless they vetted the proposals. Finance department\u2019s objections to inflated rates for items listed in tenders had resulted in the ministers concerned taking up cudgels against D\u2019Souza. The file then used to go to Parrikar, and he would stand by the finance department\u2019s notings. A political observer said that it now seems like the chief minister has succumbed to pressure from ministers who wanted him to transfer D\u2019Souza. \u201cD\u2019Souza is not the only officer, but there are complaints from some minisers of \u2018non-cooperation\u201d, sources said. D\u2019Souza has been replaced by Sunil Masurkar, additional secretary, health. In other transfers, director of transport Nikhil Desai has been appointed as managing director of Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC), of which he was holding additional charge. Director of panchayat Rajan Satardekar has been appointed as transport director, while Gopal Parsekar is the new panchayat director. Similarly, Ashutosh Apte, state registrar-cum-head of notary services has been appointed director of directorate of mines and geology, while Ajit Pawaskar, additional commissioner of excise, has been transferred and posted as joint secretary, health. Prasanna Acharya, who was awaiting posting, has been appointed as the additional collector\u2013I, South Goa, while Agnelo Fernandes, who held the post of additional collector\u2013I, South Goa, has been posted as managing director, Goa State ST Finance and Development Corporation. Acharya was retained by Parrikar as director of mines from 2012. Last week, Sawant replaced advocate general Dattaprasad Lawande, who was handling mining matters. Similarly, Neetal Amonkar, who was awaiting posting, has been appointed as managing director, Goa Education Development Corporation (GEDC), with additional charge of state project director, Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.

Celebrated on June 24 in honour of St John the Baptist, Sao Joao is marked by people wearing wreath tiaras called \u2018kopel\u2019 making merry, and taking the ceremonious plunge into wells and water bodies. Cultural programmes are organised, accompanied with the playing of Konkani cantaram and feasting on traditional Goan cuisine. \u201cPreparations to celebrate Sao Joao at Campal have begun on full swing,\u201d said former CCP councillor, Kabir Pinto Makhija. Despite its biblical associations, Sao Joao is considered to be a monsoon festival in the state. But the onset of the season playing hide-and-seek, citizens hoping to revel in the celebrations were concerned about their village wells still being dry. Artist and heritage activist Mahendra Alvares, who hosts the festival at Loutolim, said that the thunderstorm that lashed the state owing to the cyclone Vayu last week and the ongoing showers have allowed the wells to be somewhat filled. \u201cThe water level in wells has slightly risen. Besides, we have a pond which is kind of full, so the late arrival of the monsoon is not likely to affect the festive spirit,\u201d he said. St John the Baptist is considered the patron saint of the villages of Pilerne in Bardez, Bainguinim in Tiswadi, and Benaulim in Salcete. The three village churches celebrate solemn high masses followed by processions and live music by brass bands and a festival fair. \u201cWhether there are showers or not, the modernised version of Sao Joao with rain dances and pool parties are held at many locations. Though ours is a traditional style celebration in a natural water body, we will go full throttle with the preparations, irrespective of rains. We will also have another celebration in South Goa on Monday,\u201d said Mackinlay Barreto, founder, The Local Beat.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Fire and emergency services personnel said they received around 15 calls pertaining to such incidents. However, the incidence of such mishaps was not significant when compared to the previous years as the current monsoon was not accompanied by high-velocity winds. Thursday\u2019s rain also saw some drains in the state capital get clogged. In a letter to the health department and Corporation of the City of Panaji, social activist Raj Vaidya said water had begun stagnating in a drain in front of the fisheries department owing to a ramp that had been built to facilitate access to the adjoining footpath.

After the mass at 10 am, people joined in the procession and visited a few crosses before heading to the two houses for prayers and then a meal of the the fruits. Inacio Gomes, a local resident, said, \u201cMy first memory of the feast is from when I was five years old. I\u2019m 65 now, but not much has changed. Initially, there were only 50-60 people, but today over 200 have come. From 13, the number of fruits offered by the houses has grown over the years.\u201d Locals believe the saint grants the wishes of the faithful. Two things intrinsically connected to the feast are the fruits that everyone eats and the rain that blesses the farmers. The relationship between the farmers and the saint was believed to be so strong that when it wouldn\u2019t rain, they would take the saint\u2019s idol to a holy place and offer prayers, with everyone including women and kids joining in. On the same night, the rain would come pouring to bless the farmers. Another story has it that a villager, who had just lost his child, was praying at the table laden with food.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

With the state government struggling to find a way to restart mining operations, the association said that some mining firms had already begun to offer employees voluntary retirement schemes (VRS) and other financial options. The Supreme Court in February 2018 quashed the second renewal of iron ore mining leases given to 88 companies, bringing mining operations in the state to a halt from March 16, 2018. \u201cFrom May 2012 to October 2015 was the first time that mining was halted, but even then majority of the companies gave no layoffs or it was very minimal. Since last year the pressure is building on a day-to-day basis, so much so that companies are offering financial options to their employees to take VRS or take settlement,\u201d managing director of Fomento Resources and GMOEA president Ambar Timblo said. Chief minister Pramod Sawant met with a delegation of mining dependant people, who informed him about the pressure to retrench workers. Sawant in a statement urged mining firms not to retrench staff since mining activities could resume in November. Timblo said that larger companies, who have diversified interests such as Vedanta and Fomento Resources, have the capacity to bear the financial burden of salaries and overheads for a longer duration. However, in eight months to a year even these companies will struggle to keep staff on their payrolls. \u201cThe larger business houses and mining companies like a Vedanta or a Salgaocar or Chowgule are the last ones to do the layoffs. The first layoffs were the labour that came from outside of Goa. Then it will be the lower income employees,\u201d he said. Retrenching confirmed employees, who have been working for decades with companies, will be most difficult, he added. In July 2018, Chowgule and Company Pvt Ltd, has sought permission from the ministry of labour and employment to lay off 347 permanent employees in the state. In April, another company informed workers that they would be retrenched and would be compensated with a month\u2019s wage. \u201cEverybody else who subcontracted, had machinery contractors or truck business have laid off much earlier in 2013, 2014 and 2015. They have been consistently retrenching because there has been absolutely no business other than one-and-half-year for the industry,\u201d Timblo said.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

The eye sore, which is in blatant violation of the plastic ban, comes at a time when the city is already grappling with garbage problems and despite the municipality stating that the fair would be plastic-free this year. Water was seen stagnating in the plastic waste as vendors packed up and left. President of the New Market Traders Association Vinod Shirodkar said this will result in breeding of mosquitoes and a rise in dengue and other vector-borne diseases. The plastic ban, he said, is only being forced on traders at the new market. \u201cDon\u2019t the rules apply to them too? Who is taking action against them? First take action on those who left behind the garbage and then impose the plastic ban on others,\u201d Shirodkar said. Instead of imposing fines on shops handing out plastic bags, stop the problem at the source, he said. \u201cFirst shut the factories producing plastic bags. You\u2019re keeping the factories open and huge trucks bearing plastic bags are being brought in. Why aren\u2019t they being stopped on the way and action taken against them?\u201d Shirodkar said. Margao resident Jose Marie Miranda said the \u201ccomplete mess\u201d left behind after the fair is the same story every year. \u201cThere is absolutely no control on the garbage generated at the fair. There should have been bins in place to collect garbage and those responsible should have been penalised,\u201d Miranda said. Former chairperson of the municipal council Savio Coutinho said this has only added to the municipality\u2019s garbage problem. \u201cThe contractor has left behind the waste, but the municipality that doesn\u2019t have enough manpower and is already under pressure to deal with garbage is being overburdened with this additional garbage,\u201d Coutinho said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Also called summer solstice, or midsummer, the longest day occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. What: The longest day (and shortest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. When: Today (June 21). Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5\u00b0N latitude. In 2019, this will occur at 3:54 pm GMT on Friday (or 9:24 pm IST). Why: The term 'solstice' comes from Latin \u2014'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still. How: The 23.4\u00b0 tilt in the Earth's axis causes varying amounts of sunlight to reach different regions during its year-long orbit around the Sun. Today, the North Pole is tipped more towards the Sun than on any other day of the year. However, that does not mean more heat or that the Earth is any closer to the Sun, per common misconceptions. Which: Summer solstices happen twice each year (once in each hemisphere). Summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere = Winter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Also, during Equinoxes (vernal and autumnal), the Sun shines directly on the Equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal in either hemisphere. Key dates for 2019 (Northern Hemisphere)Spring Equinox: Wednesday, March 20 Summer Solstice: Friday, June 21 Autumn Equinox: Monday, September 23 Winter Solstice: Sunday, December 22 FYI: The longest day of the year was the reason why Narendra Modi chose June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

The structure has wooden beams supporting Manglaore tiles. As the school was closed for summer break for nearly two months, no maintenance was done during this period. With the first pre-monsoons showers, the beams got damp and bugs began breeding,\u201d an education official said. On Monday, the bugs fell from the roof in hordes, leading to panic among students studying from Class I to IV. Additional district education inspector Shrirang Barve said the students have been shifted to the private residence of the Kanekar family that resides in the school\u2019s vicinity, and that the existing school will be repaired as early as possible. Sources said that the officials began acting only after chief minister Pramod Sawant intervened. PTA members said they had already informed the school\u2019s authorities about the bug infestation and had sought action in this matter, but claimed that the authorities were slow to act.
