Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

According to Pavneet Singh, assistant manager , some 550 trees of 15 native tree varieties such as Amaltas, Shisham, Baheda, Ashwagandha etc were planted on a 180 sq meter land. Five hundred and fifty saplings are being planted in each such sacred forest to commemorate the upcoming 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev ji.  Quite interestingly, two of the trainees , Ravinder Singh and Kulbir Singh and, students of Public College in Samana, who took training in plantation of eco-forest at Bathinda where Punjab's first Guru Nanak Sacred forest was created , prepared the new forest.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there.

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination.

The state has to inform the court about the reasons that led to the death of the child, factors that caused delay in the rescue operation and the steps which the state is going to take to prevent such incidents in the future. The matter has been fixed for July 3 for further hearing. The division bench comprising Justice Anupinder Singh Grewal and Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill passed these orders while hearing a petition filed in public interest regarding Fatehveer's death. Additional solicitor general of India and senior advocate Satya Pal Jain informed the court that innocent minor children are losing their lives in such incidents and some steps are needed to be taken to ensure such incidents do not occur in future again. Jain also explained the guidelines/dos and don'ts issued by the Supreme Court in 2010 regarding digging of borewells, which included putting a notice board near the borewell and setting up a wall around it. Seeking court's intervention on the issue, Jain asked the court to seek report if the apex court guidelines are being complied with by the Punjab government regarding borewells and to find out the reasons of delay on the part of the authorities in the latest case. The matter has reached the high court in the wake of a petition filed by Parminder Singh Sekhon, seeking a probe into the incident that led to the death of minor boy. Sekhon pleaded for fixing the responsibility of erring officials and further directions to formulate policy and procedure for digging borewells so as to avoid any untoward incident in the future. The petitioner has demanded compensation to the victim's family because of the crucial time wasted by the officials in retrieving the boy. Two-year-old Fatehveer had fallen into a 150-foot-deep borewell on June 6 and was brought out of it after a 108-hour rescue operation. The boy was, however, declared dead when taken to PGI, Chandigarh on June 11.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The colonies resettled in the last ten years include Colony No 5, Nehru Colony, Kuldeep Colony and Mazdoor Colony. The allottees will have to pay Rs 1,000 as licence fee every month for 20 years after which they will pay the balance to get the ownership of the flat. The construction of the flats in Maloya had begun in June 2014 at a cost of Rs 250 crore under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to hand over the flat keys to the allottees in May last year, but couldn\u2019t do so as the project was incomplete. The project, construction which began in 2014, was originally meant to be completed by 2016, but it got delayed by more than two years. Chandigarh Housing Board is the nodal body for the construction of rehabilitation colonies. So far, it has built 12,736 of the total 25,728 flats proposed for slum-dwellers. Of these, around 12,000 were built in sectors 38(W), 49, Dhanas, Mauli Jagran\u2013II and Ram Darbar.

While the UT administration failed to preserve its heritage items, a London-based auction house Phillips once again auctioned three heritage furniture items of city beautiful on June 6. A sofa set designed for the high court and Assembly was auctioned for Rs 34.80 lakh, while a pair of armchair was sold for Rs 69.60 lakh. Besides, an executive desk designed for administrative buildings of Chandigarh went under the hammer for Rs 7.39 lakh. Le Corbusier and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret had designed the aforementioned items. Both used to design chairs, tables, stools, and racks for government offices in the late 1950s. The designed furniture lot was replaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, after which the administration had tossed the items in its backyards and stores. Unaware of the furniture's international worth, most UT departments had auctioned the old furniture thinking it as junk. Meanwhile, activist Ajay Jagga has written to the home minister, Amit Shah and minister for external affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and sought inquiry into the auction of these furniture items. He further requested the authorities to look into the matter and seek a report on the Protection Against Trafficking in Cultural Property, specially of Chandigarh, so that the loopholes can be plugged and a suitable action be taken, after ascertaining the facts. To preserve its heritage artefacts, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had recently asked the UT administration for taking corrective steps. Director general of ASI had advised the administration to prepare an inventory of heritage items with subsequent authentication of their authorship. The ASI had also suggested that a museum dedicated to Le Corbusier and his team can be established by the administration, which will prevent taking these works of art out of India. Heritage furniture goes under the hammer During his stay in Chandigarh, Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret designed several pieces of furniture. Some of the prototypes are present at Government Museum and Art Gallery, Sector 10. Jeanneret used the furniture in the house he stayed in at Sector 5.

They called cops, who came and asked her to file an FIR at the Charu Market police station. It was 1.30 a.m. when she reached there but, instead of taking down her complaint, the cops there directed her to Bhowanipore police station where the first assault had occured. \u201cI just gave up and started shouting at this point. There was no female police officer. The officer there finally took down my complaint after asking a lot of questions but refused to take the cabby\u2019s complaint, stating that two FIR could not be taken for the same incident,\u201d she said. Frustrated and hapless, she returned home. It was at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday that she posted the entire ordeal on Facebook along with a 20-second video clip.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option.

Sidhu was given charge of the department of power, new and renewal energy resources, and Soni was allocated the medical education & research, freedom fighters and food processing departments. In the reshuffle, Sidhu was divested of the local government and tourism and cultural affairs departments and Soni of the school education department. Senior officers in power as well as medical education and research departments said on Monday that there is no word from either Sidhu or Soni till date as to when they would take charge and start attending office. Sidhu is present in his official residence at Chandigarh, but is avoiding interaction with the media. Soni is staying in Amritsar and sources close to him said he had no plans to take charge of the new department any time soon and would stay in Amritsar at least another two days. A senior officer in the power department, who did not want to be identified, said according to standard procedure, decisions are taken by the chief minister in the absence of a minister of a particular department. But, the officer clarified, there is hardly one file in a week that needs the minister\u2019s concurrence in the power department and till date after the cabinet portfolios were changed on June 6 no file needed a ministerial okay. The functioning of the power department is mostly dependent on the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) and the Punjab State Transmission Corporation Ltd (PSTCL). Sources in the Congress said party president Rahul Gandhi is believed to have made it clear to Sidhu, during their interaction in New Delhi on June 10 that he should take charge of his new department. Therefore, there are hardly any efforts from the Congress leadership to intervene in the issue.

Telling more about the new skill of forest making acquired three months ago from his mentor, Shubhendu Sharma, Ravinder Singh said, \u201cI had some free time after completing course of BSC Agriculture which I am utilizing in serving the society with pious work of creating sacred forests as a homage to the Guru Nanak Dev Ji. It is also service to environment which is fast eroding.\u201d He said that it was honor for them that officials of agriculture department also enriched their experience with their tips during this activity.\u201d Kulbir Singh said that the technique of growing forest with Japenese Miyawaki was so simple that anybody could learn it and do wonders with splendid forest which grows and expands faster without demanding much maintenance and care. Ravneet Singh, Eco-Sikh project manager said, \u201cThe officials of Punjab forest department has been assisting us a lot by providing saplings for our sacred forests across the state. Besides this, we are also purchasing the bulk from the nurseries in Saharanpur as the saplings are not available in sufficient quantity in Punjab alone.\u201d He further told that a team of eight coordinators of Eco-Sikh were facilitated training in the forest creation technique from Shubhendu Sharma and Gaurav Gujjar at their Jodhpur center sometime ago. He expressed hope that with several trained hands committed in this mission, they would be able to create lot of sacred forests in Punjab by November this year. One in Kasur area of Pakistan has already been created by their team.

The group constituted under the chairmanship of Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Punjab food and civil supplies minister, held its first meeting on Tuesday and discussed delay in verification procedure for smart ration card. It was observed that inordinate delay occurs in verification of beneficiaries due to the performa being passed from the patwari\u2019s office to deputy commissioner. To ease the process, the group suggested that in rural areas, patwaris, block development officers and district food supply controller or his nominee verify the forms of the beneficiaries. In urban areas, inspectors of municipal committees, executive officers and secretary/superintendent level officers and in areas falling under cantonment boards the nominee of the respective deputy commissioner may do the form verification. The group was of the view that this simplification in identification/verification of beneficiaries will increase the reach of food security schemes. To maintain transparency in the procedure, the group proposed to randomly check the data to the tune of 10% by sub-divisional magistrates and 5% by deputy commissioners. It also proposed to rope in more depot holders so that beneficiaries do not have to travel far to get subsidized food grains. Village-wise re-verification of data of existing beneficiaries was also suggested. Aiming greater outreach to the needy, the group agreed to bring youth hostels, old age homes and orphanages under the preview of subsidized ration.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The final order could help governments come to a conclusion about an effective way to handle the situation, said the advocate pointing out that as the case is pending with the SC, all the high courts were requested not to pass any order relating to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and Performing Animals Rules, 2001. The pending case is between Animal Welfare Board of India and the People for Elimination of Stray Troubles and others. In the letter addressed to CJI, it was mentioned that many cases are pending in Punjab and Haryana high court where no final order is being pronounced, making it impossible for Tricity to formulate laws to deal with dog bites. According to advocate HC Arora, the whole of India, including Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, face a serious threat due to over explosion of the population of stray dogs. It was mentioned in the letter that on a rough estimate nearly 20,000 people are bitten by stray dogs every day in the country. In some cases, the bites were so serious that people have died because of them. Stating that many public interest litigations (PILs) filed by victims of dog bites are also pending with most high courts, Arora said these petitions should be allowed to proceed so that appropriate directions can be issued to the state governments for curbing the menace of stray dogs. According to him, the hearing of such petitions came to a stand still because of an interim order dated November 18, 2015 passed by the Supreme Court of India in the case related to Animal Welfare Board of India Vs. People for Elimination of Stray Troubles and others. The order requested all high courts not to pass any order relating to 1960 Act and 2001 Rules, pertaining to the stray dogs. Arora had also referred to the case pending in the Punjab and Haryana high court in which the petitioner, the father of a child, who died on account of stray dog bite, was claiming compensation. During the pendency of the this writ petition, the high court had issued several directions to the states of Punjab and Haryana, and to the Union Territory Chandigarh for framing policy for giving compensation to the victims of stray dog bites, and also for curbing the menace of stray dogs itself by various means. But the November 2015 order of the SC had made those directions void, added the advocate. It was mentioned that the last hearing of the case pending with the SC took place on June 8, 2018 but no order was passed. The advocate thus requested the CJI to start day-to-day hearing of the case at the earliest and sort the issue once and for all.

Thousands of patients who reached these hospitals had to return home without check-up. The most-affected were those who had come from far-off places, especially to PGI OPDs. Hori Lal, a resident of Mandi Gobindgarh, Punjab, had come to PGI in the morning after taking a leave without pay from the mill where he works to show his wife who has been experiencing pain in her right hand. He reached at 10am and waited till 1pm before returning disappointed. \u201cI had to spend Rs 700 to come here with my wife and daughter. But this time it was all for a waste. We will have to return next Monday now as the doctor only sits on that day. She has extreme pain in her hand and was hopeful of getting some relief today. We had thought the cause of pain would be known and medicine would be given for relief as we got the CT scan report along, but no one saw it,\u201d he said. In the sectors 16 and 32 hospitals, OPDS were shut down at 8.30am, while PGI doctors had announced on Sunday that they would suspend work in OPDs. In all three hospitals, especially in PGI, the faculty attended to patients in OPDs. In PGI, a contingency plan was devised to ensure functioning of the institute to the maximum extent possible. The OPD services were curtailed by reducing the registration timings by two hours. The OPD and diagnostic services were run by faculty, sponsored residents, foreign national residents and technical staff. As many as 3,596 patients were registered in the OPD on Monday, while 23 surgeries were performed till 5pm. All the emergency services, including labour room services, and intensive care units, functioned in a routine manner as these services were exempted from strike. Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGI, called a meeting of heads of departments on Sunday at 8 am to discuss the issue and prepare a contingency plan. Accordingly, a contingency plan was drafted and distributed to all heads of departments on Sunday itself. Dr BS Chavan, director, GMCH, said, \u201cThough doctors called a shutdown, our faculty worked hard and covered 1,500 patients in the OPDs on Monday. They were on night duty as well. If the strike continues, our faculty will be at work.\u201d In the protest on Monday, the doctors of three hospitals were joined in by members of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula units, which too had called for a strike for 24 hours till Tuesday. Doctors from different institutes joined the protest march in the evening. Dr Uttam Thakur, president, Association of Resident Doctors, PGI, said, \u201cThere is a need to enact laws in the entire country for safety of the doctors. Central security Act needs to be implemented in the whole of the country.\u201d He said that if the demands were not, then they might even suspend emergency services, but added it would be the last resort.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India.

He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

They were also directed to pay the claim amount of Rs 48,100 to the complainant. Baaj Mohamad had stated in his complaint that on November 20, 2017, his insured tipper overturned in Phase 3, Mohali, while unloading material from the vehicle. In the process, factory-fitted hydraulic system of the tipper got severely damaged. Following this, the insurance firm was intimated about the loss/ damage to the vehicle. Upon this, a surveyor was appointed by the company to assess the extent of loss/ damage caused to the insured vehicle. The surveyor visited the complainant on November 24, 2017, and gave a go ahead to get the vehicle repaired from the market and told Baaj to get a second-hand hydraulic system fitted for which he would be fully reimbursed by the insurer. The complainant acted accordingly and the repairs incurred a sum of Rs 1.53 lakh, including towing charges to the tune of Rs 8,000. In the meantime, another surveyor appointed by the company visited the complainant and took photographs of the damaged parts of the vehicle and of the insured tipper post repair. Besides collecting a copy of the insurance policy, the surveyor promised full reimbursement against the amount spent. However, on January 4, 2018, the insurer rejected the claim. In its reply, the insurance firm stated that the claim was rightly repudiated as the loss caused to the vehicle was not covered under IMT 47 and 52. The forum after hearing both the parties observed, \u201cIf a vehicle is overturned and damaged, that would be a part of accident and when the accident is covered under the terms and conditions of the policy, overturning could not be excluded from that. If it was to be excluded, there should have been specific mention of the same in the cover note/ policy. In absence of such a mention, the insurance company cannot say that since no premium was paid for overturning, the risk of overturning was not covered.\u201d It was further stated that the insurer or its agents were under obligation to disclose the extra premium for overturning and if the same was not paid, overturning would not be covered. But from the record, it does not appear that this obligation was discharged by the agents of the insurance company and thus the firm cannot claim the benefit of the overturning exclusion clause. \u201cIn view of the above findings, we are of the concerted opinion that the repudiation of claim of the complainant is wholly unjustified and amounts to deficiency in service on the part of the company, which certainly has caused immense, mental and physical harassment to the complainant,\u201d the forum observed. They were then directed to pay up.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Out patient departments (OPDs) of all private and government hospitals were closed. Patients were seen sitting in waiting halls to get medical aids, hoping the doctors might come back after calling off the strike. However, the protesting doctors with black ribbons pinned on their shoulders claimed only OPDs were closed and all essential services, including rounds by doctors in wards, were not affected. The protesting doctors also presented a memorandum to health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu demanding protection. Dr Sanjeet Singh Sodhi, president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Mohali, said there have been a number of incidents in the recent years of doctors already working under stressful conditions being assaulted by patients or their relatives. \u201cThe recent incident in West Bengal is appalling to say the least. Doctors must get better security,\u201d he said. Sidhu assured the protesting doctors that if any such incident occurs in Punjab, there would be immediate registration of an FIR against the accused. Dr Viren Dhankhar, secretary, IMA, Mohali, stated that a surgeon would never be able to give his best in high-risk cases if he has the fear of violence in his mind. This will ultimately be detrimental to the health of the patient, he said. According to Dr Charandeep Singh, there are various avenues for complaints against negligence but taking law into one\u2019s own hands is not acceptable. Dr Ashwani Kansal said IMA, Mohali, has full sympathies for the patients but has no option other than to cease OPD and non-essential medical work for the day to protest the unruly behaviour of the patients. Dr P Singh appealed to the West Bengal and the central government to take steps toward imparting justice to the assaulted doctors and prevent any violent incident in the future.

It is probably the first instance in recent times that MPs from all parties \u2014 Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal, BJP and Aam Aadmi Party \u2014 preferred to take oath in the state language. Only Deol took his oath in English. While two Union ministers Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Som Parkash had taken their oath in Punjabi on Monday, 10 other MPs followed suit on Tuesday. Linguistic diversity was the flavour of the oath-taking this time as MPs from across India predominantly took oath in their mother tongue, be it Dogri, Kannada or Konkani. Gurdaspur MP Sunny Deol takes the oath of office in EnglishOver a fornight before on May 30, Harsimrat and Som Parkash had taken their ministerial oath in English, but they were trolled by Punjabi netizens. Second-time Jalandhar MP Chaudhary Santokh Singh said it was for the first time that 12 out of 13 MPs had taken oath in Punjabi. Former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra, who was elected to Lok Sabha thrice, said it was after quite some time that such a large number of MPs from Punjab had taken oath in Punjabit. \"It was probably in 1977 that all Punjab MPs, barring one, had taken oath in Punjabi,\" he said. Three-time MP Ravneet Bittu also said that the number this time was maximum. The symbolism of MPs across parties and from diverse communities taking their oath in Punjabi in the Parliament assumes significance for Punjab, where language was made the reason of communal rift in 1950s and 60s and the state witnessed a bitter campaign against Punjabi language. While SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal concluded his oath with Sikh greeting \u201cWaheguru Ji ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh\u201d, Sanguru MP Bhagwant Mann concluded with \u201cInqalab Zindabad\u201d. Sukhbir using the Sikh salutation is being seen as an attempt to assert the Panthic identity of the Akali Dal as the party trying hard to recover its lost base. Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari, who is usually seen speaking in English, also took his oath in Punjabi. His father late Prof V N Tewari, who was a member of Rajya Sabha, was a prominent scholar of Punjabi literature. The move was also lauded by Punjabi netizens. \u201cIt will not only help in getting Punjabi language better recognition at the national level, but will also help to strengthen the spirit of Punjabiyat and Punjabi identity. The MPs should now make their speeches also in Punjabi in Parliament,\u201d said Satnam Singh Manak, president of Punjabi Jagriti Manch, which takes out an annual Punjabi march on international Language Day.

The office of traffic adviser, Punjab, took note of accidents from 2016 to 2018 in the study that found Rupnagar had the highest death rate out of the 22 districts in the state. The report was tabled in a meeting chaired by senior superintendent of police (SSP) to review traffic-related problems in the district. According to the report, 310 people died in 2017 and 290 in 2016 in Mohali. The number of deaths in 2018 was 297. The study found that the months of February, March, April, October and December were relatively more dangerous as regard to fatal accidents. The report was divided into three main aspects \u2014 dealing with general trends of accidents over the past three years along with its various analysis; dealing with the availability of resources within the state and in Mohali along with corresponding road accidents and highway patrol vehicle deployment. A detailed police station wise analysis revealed that Lalru, Derabassi and Zirakpur were the three police stations out of 14 in which more than 47% deaths were reported. All are on Ambala-Zirakpur national highway. Sohana and Kharar sadar police came next. In Lalru, 52 people lost their lives in 2017 followed by 43 in Derabassi, 40 in Zirakpur and 33 in Sohana in 2017. The report said 135 people died on the stretch between Zirakpur and Jharmari in 2017. Flaws detected in airport road designPunjab traffic adviser Navdeep Asija had also conducted a three-dimensional (3D) safety audit using drones to investigate the geometric design of three blind spots on the airport road in Mohali. The report revealed major flaws in design and engineering, proving that the road is not pedestrian and cyclist-friendly. The 3D audit was conducted on road crossings near Sohana gurdwara, IISER intersection and Sector 66-67 light point intersections. The report suggested that construction of modern roundabouts on these strategic locations could prove efficient and safer. Asija said, \u201cWe have conducted 3D study of geometric design of three blind spots on the airport road in Mohali using drones and have observed major flaws in design which causes accidents and make airport road unsafe for people. The road is not safe for pedestrians and cyclists as they are the majority of accident victims. So, we have laid special design emphasis for safety of pedestrians and cyclists while suggesting improvements. None of the traffic lights on these junctions is as per the traffic volume.\u201d He said the office conducted the drone survey last month and on the basis of its findings prepared a report on March 12. It has been submitted to the inspector general, traffic, and would be forwarded to Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) for corrective action.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. He defeated Congress's Ramnaraian Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently concluded general election. He has also been elected to Rajasthan assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. Birla will succeed eight-term MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this will not be for the first time a relative newcomer will hold the position. In 1996, TDP leader G M C Balayogi was also a two-time MP when he was elected as the LS Speaker and after his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and the first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.
