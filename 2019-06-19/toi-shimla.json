We have given a green signal to traffic from June 10,\u201d 38 Border Road Task Force (38 BRTF) commander Col Uma Shankar said. He added that clearing 30 to 40ft deep snow from Rohtang and Baralacha passes was the main challenge. The 16 BRTF of the BRO had cleared snow from Leh to Sarchu a few days back but clearing snow from Manali to Sarchu was a big challenge for 38 BRTF. According to BRO officials, over a 100 avalanches along the Manali-Sarchu highway had not only deposited over 50ft thick layer of snow and ice but also damaged the road at many places. The highway till Lahaul valley was opened for vehicles on May 18 after BRO jawans had cleared snow from the 13,050ft high Rohtang pass but it took another three weeks for them to clear snow from Baralacha pass. The snow clearance operations on Manali-Leh highway had started officially on March 25. Multiple attack points were made to clear snow fast and different teams were clearing snow at multiple stages in Manali and Lahaul. Opening of the Manali-Leh highway has not only provided relief to local residents but it will help the Army in supplying essential goods to border areas of Ladakh. Also, it will boost tourism as thousands of them are waiting for opening of this highway. Uma Shankar said that they would continue to improve road surface conditions, widening of the highway and various civil works. Meanwhile, the BRO will now concentrate on the opening of the Manali-Spiti road after clearing snow from Kunzum pass.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option. We need to see how this will pan out.\" In Video:Bill seeking to lift green card cap amended to protect US workersDownload The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."}, "Seasonal snow cover up 25.16% in Himachal": {"time": "2019-06-14 07:03:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/seasonal-snow-cover-up-25-16-in-himachal/articleshow/69780070.cms", "description": "Shimla: Assessment of spatial distribution of seasonal snow cover during 2018-19 in Himachal Pradesh using space data has revealed that there is considerably increased snowfall in the Himalayas in Himachal. The analysis, based on The Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) satellite data for 2018-19, was done for assessing the total area under snow cover during October-March period and its temporal analysis with that of the monthly averaged values of the total area under snow in 2017-18. As a whole, total increase of 25.16% in the area under snow cover has been observed in Himachal Pradesh in 2018-19 in comparison to the total area in the preceding year. Himachal Pradesh receives winter precipitation in the form of snow at the higher altitudes. About one-third of the total geographical area of the state remains under thick snow cover during the winter season. Most of the major rivers like Chenab, Beas, Parvati, Baspa, Spiti, Ravi, Satluj and their perennial tributaries originating from the Himalayas depend on the seasonal snow cover for their discharge dependability. Besides, the snow cover also helps in controlling the accumulation and ablation patterns of the glaciated regions in the state. Considering the importance of seasonal snow cover as a major input in controlling the hydrology of the river basins, its assessment in spatial distribution is carried out in different river basins in Himachal Pradesh during the winter season from October to March. During the last winter in 2018-19, it was a general perception that the winter precipitation was of higher magnitude in comparison to the preceding year. Keeping this into consideration, the total area under snow cover was estimated using satellite data during 2018-19 and was compared with that of the values estimated during the period 2017-18 in the state. The study was conducted by the Himachal Pradesh State Centre on Climate Change under the aegis of Council for Science, Technology and Environment, and Space Application Centre, ISRO, Ahmedabad. Based on the satellite data, it was observed that by and large all the river basins of Himachal Pradesh show an increased percentage change in their area under snow, reflecting that 2018-19 is the year of exceptionally heavy snowfall in all the basins of state. Basin-wise analysis from October to March in 2018-19 and its comparative analysis with that of 2017-18 reveals that, in Chenab basin, maximum increase is of the order of about 183.2% in the month of October, whereas November shows an increase of about 45.1% and December and January an increase of about 17.4% and 4.2% respectively, and February and March show about 7.2% and 5.3% increase in comparison to 2017-18. Ravi basin shows overall increase of about 411.2% in October, while in November it shows an increase of about 93% in 2018-19, whereas January, February and March show 38.3%, 96.1% and 51.2% respectively, and in December, the total snow cover decreased by 11.4% (2018-19) in comparison to the corresponding period in previous year. Beas basin also shows a more or less similar trend of increase in October of about 106.45%, whereas November, February and March show increase of 52.66%, 31.46%, 30.69%, respectively, in 2018-19, and there is reduction of 16.18 % in the month of December (2018-19). In Satluj basin, it is concluded that during 2018-19, there is considerably increased snowfall in October (185.2%) and November (75.2%), whereas December and January months show reduction of 0.95% and 0.05%, and an increase of the order of 14.9% and 18.1%, respectively, is in February and March.

This time, some tourists from Uttar Pradesh scuffled with a local man in Mandi and even fired a gunshot in the air to scare him. Earlier, a group of local residents had thrashed some Punjabi tourists in McLeodganj following an argument on Saturday late night, while an angry mob had manhandled four visitors from Haryana, who had beaten up a truck driver in Kullu on Monday. In the latest incident, two UP tourists scuffled with a person at Nagchala in Mandi district on Monday night. One of them, who is an inspector with the UP Police, in a bid to intimidate the person, pulled out the gun and fired a shot in the air. According to sources, the scuffle between the local man and tourists started over the issue of car parking. Lunapani resident Avtar Singh stopped his car after a SUV came in front of him from the wrong side on the national highway. During the ensuing argument, the driver of the SUV pulled out his gun and fired in the air. The accused have been identified as inspector Jitender Singh, a resident of Farrukhabad in UP, and Abhishek Singh, a resident of Etawah in the same state. Mandi superintendent of police (SP) Gurdev Chand Sharma said both tourists have been arrested under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC and sections 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act. A large number of conflicts between tourists and local residents on small issues are coming to light. Such incidents are common in tourist places like Manali, Shimla and Dharamshala. Road-rage, overtaking, playing loud music, hurling abuse, drinking while travelling, non-payment of bills and eve-teasing are the common reasons of such conflicts. The difference in culture and tone is also a reason for the scuffles. The scuffle increases during peak summer season. \"It is not that every time tourists are wrong. Some mischievous local elements also create ruckus. Very few of the incidents are reported to the police,\" said a local taxi operator. \"We have got used to tourists intimidating us with guns, steel roads and sharp-edge weapons. Some tourists become violent on small issues. We are habitual to hearing derogatory language. People of Himachal have a soft voice and light tone, while tourists coming from some states have heavy and rough tone, which is sometimes taken for a threat by local residents. We deal with good educated tourists as well but mischievous elements also come along,\" said taxi driver Ramesh Thakur, who was threatened with a gun by a tourist at Rohtang some time back. May and June are the months of peak tourist season and this is the time when traffic jams, noise pollution, crowding and extra burden on local resources irks majority of residents, especially those who have nothing to do with the tourism industry. This is the time when police are relatively busier in maintaining law and order as crime rate also increases. On one hand, tourism is one of the main sources of state's economy, while on the other, the maddening tourist crowd, weak infrastructure and unplanned tourism are taken their toll on the peaceful atmosphere of the state.

The party has claimed that in the absence of special industrial package industries, global investors would not come to the state, rather the existing ones too would migrate to other parts of the country. The Jai Ram Thakur-led government has set the target to attract Rs 85,000 crore investment through the meet. Leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihtori, who was industries minister in the previous Congress regime, said if Himachal Pradesh failed to get industrial package, then existing industries would migrate out of state. While interacting with media persons in Shimla, he said migration was already taking place as some industries were forced to work at low capacity while some had resorted retrenching of work force. He added that retrenchment of work force could stop only when the state got industrial package. He questioned the efforts to attract investment in the state without an industrial package. Agnihotri claimed that during the proposed global investors\u2019 meet, people would sign the MoUs under pressure from the state government but actual investment would come only when the state would get industrial package. He added that Himachal Pradesh should get industrial package on the pattern of North Eastern states. At present around 700 industrial plots are lying vacant in the state while two state-of-the-art industrial areas are being developed at Kandrori and Pandoga. The state government has managed to attract industrial investment of Rs 17,000 crore with the signing of 159 MoUs a few months back. To propel industrial growth, Himachal bureau of investment has is also proposed for the state.

Since June 10, very few tourists could reach their destinations, while most others had to abandon their journey midway. Many spent chilly night near Baralacha, which has 10 to 25ft of snow, while some camped at Keylong and Jispa to wait for the opening of road. Even though the Border Roads Organization (BRO) has cut through the deep snow and made a gallery for the passage of vehicles, it is so narrow at some points that only one vehicle can move at one time. A truck transporting goods from Manali to Leh overturned on the highway at Zingzingbar on June 11 and blocked the highway for the whole day.

It is difficult for the tourists to spend a night in case of emergency in the upper end of Baralacha, as seasonal tourist camps at Sarchu are not ready yet.

Transport officials, when contacted, said prices for per kilometre were generally fixed by the deputy commissioners of the area.

Rates for taxis have not been revised since 2011. We are going to hold a meeting in this regard,\u201d Sharma said. Number of taxis is increasing gradually in this region but quality of services is not up to the mark due to inefficiency of government. Despite being a tourist state, Himachal Pradesh has no tourism minister in the present BJP government. Many issues in tourism sector are needed to be addressed. Lack of staff in tourism department is also a major road block to an improved tourism. Categorization of hotels is pending for over 10 years. It was planned to help tourist to book accommodation according to their budget but nothing has been done in this regard.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

The analysis has been made from the AWiFS satellite data for 2018-19 for assessing the total area under snow cover during the period October to March and its temporal analysis with that of the monthly averaged values of the total area under snow 2017-18. As a whole total increase of 25.16% in the area under snow cover has been observed in Himachal Pradesh in 2018-19 in comparison to the total area during 2017-18. Himachal Pradesh receives winter precipitation in the form of snow at the higher altitudes. About 1/3rd of the total geographical area of the state remains under thick snow cover during winter season. Most of the major rivers like Chenab, Beas, Parvati, Baspa, Spiti, Ravi, Satluj and their perennial tributaries originating from the Himalayas depend upon the seasonal snow cover for their discharge dependability. Besides this, the snow cover also helps in controlling the accumulation and ablations patterns of the glaciated regions in the State. Considering the importance of seasonal snow cover as a major input in controlling the hydrology of the river basins, seasonal snow cover assessment in its spatial distribution is being carried out in different river basins in Himachal Pradesh during the winter season from October to March. During the last winter that is 2018-19, it was a general perception that the winter precipitation was of higher magnitude in comparison to the preceding year. Keeping this into consideration, total area under snow cover was estimated using satellite data during 2018-19 and was compared with that of the values estimated during the period 2017-18 in Himachal Pradesh. The study was conducted by the Himachal Pradesh State Centre on Climate Change under the aegis of HO Council for Science, Technology and Environment and Space Application Centre, ISRO, Ahmadabad. Based on the satellite data it has been observed that by and large all the river basins of Himachal Pradesh show an increased percentage change in their area under snow reflecting that 2018-19 is the year of exceptionally heavy snowfall in all the basins of the state. A basin-wise analysis from October to March in 2018-19 and its comparative analysis with that of 2017-18 reveals that, in Chenab basin, maximum increase is of the order of about 183.2% in the month of October, whereas November shows an increase of about 45.1% and December, January shows an increase of about 17.4% and 4.2% respectively and February, March shows about 7.2% and 5.3% increase in comparison to 2017-18. Ravi basin shows an overall increase of about 411.2% in October, while in November it shows an increase of about 93% in 2018-19 whereas January, February and March show 38.3%, 96.1% and 51.2% respectively. In December, total snow cover has decreased by 11.4% (2018-19) in comparison to 2017-18. Beas basin also shows a more or less similar trend of increase in October by about 106.45%, whereas November, February and March shows of 52.66%, 31.46%, 30.69% respectively in 2018-19, and there is a reduction of 16.18 % in the month of December (2018-19). In Satluj basin it is concluded that during 2018-19 there is considerably increased snowfall in October (185.2%) and November (75.2%). Whereas December and January months showing reduction of 0.95% and 0.05%. and the increase of the order of 14.9% and 18.1% respectively in February and March.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

It has decided to make most of the roads of Manali one-way from Thursday onwards. Officials said this plan may force people to cover some extra distance, but it will help reduce jam and their precious time. The vehicles can enter the town via the national highway only from the south side. The entry from other roads would be stopped. Similarly, only one road from the northern side of the town will remain open for vehicles going out of the town. Similarly, vehicles coming from Old Manali, Rohtang and New Manali sides will have to reach the southern end of the town through the bypass road to enter the town. The bus stand road will be blocked for all vehicles except for buses. After having detailed discussion with police and officials of other departments, Manali sub-divisional magistrate Raman Gharsangi said, \u201cWe are planning more changes in the traffic system of the town. Hopefully Manali town will breathe freely after making the roads one-way. We shall install signages along the highway and some crucial points to guide the tourists. We will use a large number of barricades to regulate the traffic. The new traffic plan will be in force from Thursday.\u201d As the police department is suffering the shortage of police personnel, Gharsangi said some volunteers from Government College, Haripur, and the local taxi union will help police in traffic management on Manali-Rohtang highway and within the town. He said the parking being the major problem of the town, some space in available parking lots would be reserved for tourists. The police would be strict on idle parking and would tow away such vehicles, he said. The SDM said NHAI and PWD have been directed to improve road conditions at some portions for smooth traffic movement.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

Association claimed in last 6 years, the license fee for serving and sale of alcohol in the bars, restaurants and hotels in the state has gone up by 700%. It also claimed that imposition of minimum guaranteed quota system has led to the victimization of tax paying and revenue generating bar and hotel owners. Shimla Hotel and Restaurant Association president Sanjay Sood said their association demands from the state government to review and revise the state excise policy for liquor licenses. \u201cWe are requesting to make the provisions as per the general benefits of the population at large of state and not to take any undue examples from other states, as each state has its own set of rules as per their geographical and demographical set up,\u201d he added.

That is the time Delhi resident Rajat Thakur had to spend on the road to enjoy three hours on Rohtang Pass on Wednesday. It was not really enjoyable, though: the IIT graduate boarded a six-seater taxi in Manali at 1am, sat in it till 12pm to travel just 51km to reach the mountain pass, and then travelled in it from 3pm to 11pm to return to Manali \u2014 moving at 5km/hour. Of the 24 hours that comprised the day, the 102km road journey to and from Rohtang, which takes at most five hours in lean season, consumed nearly 19 hours \u2014 11 hours to reach Rohtang and eight to return. Another three hours were spent on the mountain pass. Thakur told TOI on Sunday that he and five of his friends and family members were offered the trip by a taxi operators\u2019 union on Mall Road in Manali. He said they paid Rs 12,000, but instead of rejuvenating him, the trip made him wonder about tourism-inflicted damage to environment. His concern is not unfounded. The National Green Tribunal (NGT), to limit damage to environment, in 2015 banned commercial activity in Rohtang, Solang and Marhi areas near Manali. Now, as part of NGT restrictions, only 1,200 taxis and 100 private ones are given a permit to drive up to Rohtang and return the same day. But, there is no cap on vehicles which travel beyond Rohtang and the only rider is they cannot return on the same day. This loophole made life miserable for Rajat and is also affecting the ecology of Rohtang area. A taxi operator from Manali, who did not wish to be named as he feared backlash from others, said taxi operators who used the permit for travelling beyond Rohtang picked up passengers as early as 1am. \u201cThose who have the permit for Rohtang leave at 5am and return in time,\u201d he said. Rajat says even his taxi had the permit for travelling beyond Rohtang. \u201cI got to know of it while returning. The driver sped past the Gulaba checkpost. When I asked him why, he said he only had the permit beyond Rohtang and could not return on the same day.\u201d Gulaba checkpost is where vehicles going to and coming back from Rohtang are checked for permits. Thakur said the route had been littered by tourists as traffic was crawling throughout. \u201cIt was better in Rohtang, but something should be done en route,\u201d he said. Mall Road-based Him-Aanchal Taxi Operators Union Manali president Gupt Ram confirmed that taxis were using the \u2018beyond Rohtang\u2019 permit just to take tourists to the mountain pass. \u201cWe cannot do anything. There is too much demand and the number of permits too less,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyway, if a driver is caught, he is fined Rs 5,000.\u201d Ram acknowledged it could have taken Thakur 22 hours. \u201cIn some cases, it takes longer,\u201d he said. For Thakur, though, the main concern was environment. \u201cSomeone has to put an end to this,\u201d he added.

He said that shifting of such a big army institution out of the state would adversely affect the economy of Shimla and the state, and loss of employment for local people. In his letter, Anand Sharma said that Shimla has been a Summer capital of the country and the State will lose its pride if the ARTRAC is shifted out of the state. \u201cIn view of the popular demand and opinion of senior army officers including retired Service Chiefs and Strategic Experts I seek your urgent intervention to retain ARTRAC in Shimla,\u201d he added. He said that Shimla has been a strategic location of the Indian Army for almost 150 years and was the headquarters of the then Indian Army during the British period from 1864 to 1939, which included two World Wars in which British India Army fought. After India\u2019s independence, the headquarters of Western Command was located in Shimla during the Indo-Pak war in 1948, 1965 and 1971 as well as the India-China war of 1962. Western Command was shifted to Chandimandir only in 1985. He said that on raising of headquarters of Army Training at Mhow, the leadership of the Army considered Shimla as the best location for this prestigious ARTRAC and also to make best use of available Western Command infrastructure. \u201cIt was categorically stated by previous Army Commanders, that Shimla was selected as best suitable place for Headquarter ARTRAC given its unique charter different from all regional Commands where officers and soldiers are able to conceptualize the concepts and doctrine in a conducive environment,\u201d he added. He said that ever since its establishment in 1993, the Ministry of Defence has, over a period of 27 years allocated large amount of funds and resources for the ARTRAC. \u201cI am given to understand, that the logic being extended that there is shortage of accommodation at Shimla post merger of DGMT and ARTRAC, lacks substance as adequate infrastructure is available at Jutogh Cantonment,\u201d he added.

This time, some tourists from Uttar Pradesh scuffled with a local man in Mandi and even fired a gunshot in the air to scare him. Earlier, a group of local residents had thrashed some Punjabi tourists in McLeodganj following an argument on Saturday late night, while an angry mob had manhandled four visitors from Haryana, who had beaten up a truck driver in Kullu on Monday. In the latest incident, two UP tourists scuffled with a person at Nagchala in Mandi district on Monday night. One of them, who is an inspector with the UP Police, in a bid to intimidate the person, pulled out the gun and fired a shot in the air. According to sources, the scuffle between the local man and tourists started over the issue of car parking. Lunapani resident Avtar Singh stopped his car after a SUV came in front of him from the wrong side on the national highway. During the ensuing argument, the driver of the SUV pulled out his gun and fired in the air. The accused have been identified as inspector Jitender Singh, a resident of Farrukhabad in UP, and Abhishek Singh, a resident of Etawah in the same state. Mandi superintendent of police (SP) Gurdev Chand Sharma said both tourists have been arrested under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC and sections 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act. A large number of conflicts between tourists and local residents on small issues are coming to light. Such incidents are common in tourist places like Manali, Shimla and Dharamshala. Road-rage, overtaking, playing loud music, hurling abuse, drinking while travelling, non-payment of bills and eve-teasing are the common reasons of such conflicts. The difference in culture and tone is also a reason for the scuffles. The scuffle increases during peak summer season. \u201cIt is not that every time tourists are wrong. Some mischievous local elements also create ruckus. Very few of the incidents are reported to the police,\u201d said a local taxi operator. \u201cWe have got used to tourists intimidating us with guns, steel roads and sharp-edge weapons. Some tourists become violent on small issues. We are habitual to hearing derogatory language. People of Himachal have a soft voice and light tone, while tourists coming from some states have heavy and rough tone, which is sometimes taken for a threat by local residents. We deal with good educated tourists as well but mischievous elements also come along,\u201d said taxi driver Ramesh Thakur, who was threatened with a gun by a tourist at Rohtang some time back. May and June are the months of peak tourist season and this is the time when traffic jams, noise pollution, crowding and extra burden on local resources irks majority of residents, especially those who have nothing to do with the tourism industry. This is the time when police are relatively busier in maintaining law and order as crime rate also increases. On one hand, tourism is one of the main sources of state\u2019s economy, while on the other, the maddening tourist crowd, weak infrastructure and unplanned tourism are taken their toll on the peaceful atmosphere of the state.

Moreover, the shortage of staff has also led to a failure of civic authorities to provide many basic facilities to the residents of this hill town.

All panchayats of Manali block have pledged to have no tolerance for littering. There are also plans to start garbage collection from all villages and commercial units and ensuring the garbage was disposed of properly. This decision was taken in a meeting of all all pachayats which met here on Saturday. Of the 40 panchayats, 38 completed the quorum in first sitting. Each panchayat has made its own action plan on garbage collection and disposal. Hallan-II panchayat started garbage collection from Sunday itself. A waste-to-energy plant with power generation capacity of 1.5MW is expected to start functioning in a few days. Dumping and processing of garbage has been a problem in Manali and Kullu for long. Piles of garbage welcome tourists to both Kullu and Manali. Both Kullu and Manali municipal councils do not have an operation treatment plant and are forced to dump their garbage. Manali block development officer Kalyani Gupta said the panchayats\u2019 enthusiasm in curbing littering was a \u201cpositive sign\u201d and showed that they were concerned for the proper garbage disposal. \u201cDepending on geography, strength and other aspects, each panchayat has its own action plan. Panchayats may collect pre-decided fees from each house and commercial units. We are emphasizing on segregation at source. When people make it a habit to collect and hand over garbage for disposal, it is possible to enforce door-to-door garbage collection. We can take help from mahila and yuvak mandals,\u201d she said. As majority of hotels of Manali are under jurisdiction of panchayats, they will have to cooperate with the panchayats who will directly charge fees from them.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

A decision has also been made to make Tutikandi parking available for tourist vehicles during weekends. Kashyap said that regulating traffic during tourist season is necessary as rising number of vehicles in the hill town creates problems and it aggravates during the tourist season. Since the number of vehicles in the hill town increases by 4 to 6 times during tourist seasons, there is need to regulate the traffic, on one hand, and to create awareness among tourists and local people, on the other.

To this end, the government plans to table a bill in the coming monsoon session of the assembly to increase the licence fee of commission agents to Rs 50 lakh. In the last apple season, farmers were duped of crores of rupees by commission agents who went underground after selling the produce brought from farmers on credit. Agriculture minister Dr Ram Lal Markanda held a meeting with the law department officials last week to discuss the proposed amendment. He said the government was serious about safeguarding the interests of farmers and considering hiking the security fee to Rs 50 lakh so that growers could be paid from the security deposit in case they were cheated. He said FIRs had been registered against some commission agents for fleecing the farmers, while in some cases licences had also been revoked. Sources said that in the last apple season, around three dozen commission agents had cheated farmers of several crores of rupees by not paying the amount in return for their apple produce. Following protests by farmers, the state government is mulling making the licensing process for the commission agents tougher. As a deterrent, it is planning to make it mandatory for commission agents to deposit all the required documents along with Rs 50 lakh security fee before issuing the licence. In case a commission agent fails to pay farmers, then the agriculture produce market committee of the district concerned will make the payment from this security money. In case the payment is much more than the deposited amount, a legal recourse would be adopted, sources added. During the previous Congress regime, then chief minister Virbhadra Singh had also increased the license security fee of commission agents to Rs 25 lakh in 2016. The decision was even challenged in the state high court.

Cops from Bhowanipore arrived around 10-15 minutes later.

But the nightmare was far from being over. \u201cThe boys had followed us till my colleague\u2019s house and, right when we were dropping him at Lake Gardens, six of them on three bikes came and stopped the car. They pelted stones, smashing the window. They then dragged me out and tried to break my phone to delete the video. Luckily, local people heard my cries for help and came out. The boys then fled,\u201d Sengupta recalled.   She then called her father and sister; her own residence was just a lane away. They called cops, who came and asked her to file an FIR at the Charu Market police station. It was 1.30 a.m. when she reached there but, instead of taking down her complaint, the cops there directed her to Bhowanipore police station where the first assault had occured. \u201cI just gave up and started shouting at this point. There was no female police officer. The officer there finally took down my complaint after asking a lot of questions but refused to take the cabby\u2019s complaint, stating that two FIR could not be taken for the same incident,\u201d she said. Frustrated and hapless, she returned home. It was at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday that she posted the entire ordeal on Facebook along with a 20-second video clip.

More arrests are likely and we will probe whether there was lack of adequate response from cops,\u201d said a Lalbazar official. The arrested were identified as Sheikh Rahit, Fardeen Khan, Sheikh Shabir Ali, Sheikh Gani, Sheikh Imran Ali, Sheikh Wasim and Atif Khan alias Md Samsad.

One of the bikes\u2019 rear view mirrors broke and the youths accosted cabby Tarak Debnath to demand compensation.

This document compiles primary and secondary evidences of the impacts triggered by underground construction for run-of-the-river (ROR) hydropower projects and highlights the issues of environmental hazards and risks involved. \u201cA report of the state\u2019s own disaster management cell says that around 10 mega hydropower stations are located in the medium and high-risk landslide areas,\u201d said the document. The report explains that the magnitude of underground component of the civil work in hydropower projects involving blasting and dynamiting exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. These impacts are yet to be adequately studied and understood. Visuals and testimonies of affected people from project sites in Kinnaur, Kullu and Chamba falling in the Satluj, Beas and Ravi basin collected over the years have been used to show the impacts. Case studies like that of the Parbati II, Karccham Wangtoo, Kashang and Bajoli Holi projects illustrate how landslides, drying up of springs, damages to houses, farms and forests have made difficult the lives and livelihoods of the people in the project area. The report finds that the existing studies available on these impacts are inadequate or biased in favour of the hydropower producers, with economics as the main concern. Environment impact assessment (EIA) reports of hydropower projects gloss over the geological and seismic vulnerability of the project sites, with an explanation that the \u201churdles, surprises and incompetencies\u201d of the mountain geology would be handled at a later stage, if and when they occur. \u201cScientific\u201d linkages become difficult to establish later, and during EIAs, the concentration is to only rush through the studies to get \u201cclearances.\u201d \u201cThey say there is no scientific evidence that the landslides are because of project activities and so we cannot claim compensation in case of cracks in the houses or damage to fields,\u201d says Ramanand Negi of Urni village located in the affected area of the Karchham Wangtoo project and now sitting on a huge landslide. The report also refers to audit reports of the Comptroller Auditor General (CAG) to show how the costs of these \u201csurprises\u201d are borne by the affected people or transferred to the public exchequer. The costs that producers have been forced to bear have led to financial losses and bad loans and cumulatively a slump in the hydropower sector over the last few years. According to the report, \u201cThe contribution of hydropower sector today to the country\u2019s total electricity production has halved from 25% to 13% in the last decade. While this state of hydropower industries was an opportunity to review hydropower policy and the sector\u2019s viability, the report of Parliamentary standing committee on energy that reviewed the performance of hydro projects in 2018 turned a blind eye to environmental impacts and safety norms.\u201d Based on the committee\u2019s recommendations, the ministry of power issued an order in March this year recognizing hydropower projects with a capacity of more than 25 MW as \u2018renewable\u2019 source of energy, thus eligible for further subsidies. Himdhara\u2019s report, however, brings out that hydrprojects do not deserve the \u2018green\u2019 tag and the government should stop further subsidizing the sector, especially large projects. The report says that an independent scientific review of the immediate or long-term implications of construction work for hydropower development in the Himalayas should be commissioned. Citizens engagement, public consent mechanisms needs to be strengthened, and a grievance redressal process needs to be put in place, it added.

Deputy Commissioner Amit Kashyap said that a meeting was held on Tuesday to review the traffic situation. He said that Shimla superintendent of police (SP) has been requested to deploy additional police force at important points in the city to regulate traffic. A decision has also been made to make Tutikandi parking available for tourist vehicles during weekends. Kashyap said that regulating traffic during tourist season is necessary as rising number of vehicles in the hill town creates problems and it aggravates during the tourist season. Since the number of vehicles in the hill town increases by 4 to 6 times during tourist seasons, there is need to regulate the traffic, on one hand, and to create awareness among tourists and local people, on the other. He said that in the wake of tourist rush, the Shimla SP would increase deployment of traffic police personnel, especially from Shoghi to Dhalli and all other important locations. He has also directed for regular deployment of police riders between Victory Tunnel and Tutijandi bypass parking. During the school hours in the morning and evening, the police riders should be deployed up to New Shimla. He has also directed the Public Works Department (PWD) to remove construction material lying along the roads between Shoghi and Dhalli as they are affecting traffic movement. Directions have also been issued to speed up widening of roads at various places and fill the potholes on roads. For smooth flow of traffic, directions have been issued for the buses to stop at designated stoppages only. The traffic coming from Chandigarh for Upper Shimla would be diverted to Shoghi bypass, while the traffic from Dhalli for Solan and Chandigarh would be diverted to Dhalli bypass.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The traffic at some points is moving very slow due to road construction work but we have got rid of hour-long jams starting from Kullu.\u201d Hoteliers said the availability of high mountains of snow at Rohtang Pass has ensured prolonged tourism season this year. \u201cMother Nature has blessed us with good snowfall this season.
