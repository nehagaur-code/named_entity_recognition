{"Delhi\u2019s theatre fraternity pays tribute to Girish Karnad: He spoke up when all fell silent": {"datetime": "", "time": "2019-06-19 01:00:00", "description": "Renowned theatre personalities of Delhi gathered at Triveni Kala Sangam on Friday to remember Girish Karnad and his extraordinary life and works. Theatre actors, directors, NSD professors and students paid a rich tribute to the celebrated playwright, director and actor, who died on June 10. Reminiscing about Karnad\u2019s career that spanned five decades, speakers said the intellectual giant was a master of his craft, and his position in theatre would be impossible to fill. \u2018I could imagine only Girish as Moby Dick\u2019s Captain Ahab\u2019 Bharat Karnad, national security expert and Girish Karnad\u2019s nephew, shared his childhood memories with the artiste. \u201cGirish was 10 years elder to me. When we were young, we used to watch Hollywood movies. Afterwards, Girish would enact those characters for me. More than the films, I used to look forward to Girish\u2019s enactment. He used to mimic Captain Ahab and when I read Moby Dick later, I could imagine only Girish as Captain Ahab,\u201d he said. Bharat Karnad\u2018We must all speak Girish\u2019s language before it is too late\u2019Veteran actor MK Raina recalled how Karnad was always championing various causes. \u201cTwo such incidents really affected me. When Karnad became the head of Sangeet Natak Akademi, he instituted several health initiatives for artists. He was the first person to be concerned about what happens to the artists later, even after getting an Akademi honour. When Babri Masjid was demolished, we artists decided to go to the Masjid to stage a concert on the theme \u2013 Kahan se shuru kiya tha desh ko chalana, kahan pahuncha. Aur Girish Karnad pahunche wahan (Girish Karnad reached there). While I was presenting on stage, a policeman came to me and said if there is any firing, just bend down. Girish looked at me, came on the stage and said, \u2018I will compere now\u2019. Uske baad desh badalta gaya, violence badhta raha, woh hamesha khade rahe (after that country kept changing, violence kept increasing but he was undeterred).Today, every writer, painter, dramatist, and actor must speak Girish\u2019s language before it is too late for us,\u201d said Raina. MK RainaDP Tripathi\u2018Is it enough to remember Girish Karnad only for his writing?\u2019Even as Karnad\u2019s contribution to literature and theatre is unparalleled, speakers hailed him for his courage to stand for the causes he believed in. Theatre director Arvind Gaur said, \u201cWhy are we remembering Girish Karnad? Main us aadmi ko yaad kar raha hoon jo us waqt bol raha tha, sadak par utar raha tha, jab log nahi bol rahe they. He spoke during Emergency. He had resigned from the position of FTII director. Is it enough to remember Girish Karnad only for his writing? Once, I had to speak at Sangeet Natak Akademi\u2019s festival. I started talking in Hindi and government officials stopped me. Karnad intervened and said, \u2018Bolne dijiye unko\u2019. Hum aaj is meeting se ye lekar jayein ki hum chup na rahein. Us aadmi se seekhein jo oxygen laga kar sadak par khada tha ki haan, main urban Naxal hoon.\" Tripurari Sharma, NSD professor and theatre director, said, \u201cI find it difficult to talk about Girish ji because he was a private person. I think we all, as a generation, have so much respect for him. He had a fierce connection with freedom, you can see it in his writings.\u201d Devendra Raj AnkurArvind Gaur Tripurari Sharma Anwar JamalAshok Maheshwari Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhis-theatre-fraternity-pays-tribute-to-girish-karnad-he-spoke-up-when-all-fell-silent/articleshow/69841472.cms"}, "Lesser known facts about Gurmeet Choudhary": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/lesser-known-facts-about-gurmeet-choudhary/photostory/65672397.cms", "description": ""}, "Here's a look at the Television actresses who will be making their Bollywood debut with their upcoming films": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/heres-a-look-at-the-television-actresses-who-will-be-making-their-bollywood-debut-with-their-upcoming-films/photostory/65721112.cms", "description": ""}, "In and out": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/inandout/articleshow/69780769.cms", "description": ""}, "Provisional admission for EWS students in DU": {"datetime": "", "time": "2019-06-19 10:08:00", "description": "NEW DELHI: Students from economically weaker section (EWS) can get provisional admission in Delhi University by using acknowledgement receipt from authorities if there is a delay in procuring category certificate, an official said on Tuesday.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. He defeated Congress's Ramnaraian Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently concluded general election. He has also been elected to Rajasthan assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. Birla will succeed eight-term MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this will not be for the first time a relative newcomer will hold the position. In 1996, TDP leader G M C Balayogi was also a two-time MP when he was elected as the LS Speaker and after his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and the first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

A majority of these are CGHS societies in Dwarka that were provided solar panels last year under the \u2018Solar City Initiative - Solarise Dwarka\u2019 scheme by BSES in collaboration with TERI and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ India) under the Indo-German solar partnership project. Initially, seven societies were chosen for the project and they reported cumulative savings of 6.5 lakh electricity units and Rs 32 lakh annually. This model has proved attractive for others and more societies are joining in to avail long-term benefits. \u201cSolar panels with a capacity of 100kW were installed in our society last April. There are about 60 dwelling units here. The surplus power generated is sent back to the grid. Annually, over 1 lakh units are being saved and they are adjusted against our bills. After seeing the reduction in bills, other societies have also installed solar panels,\u201d said KR Anand from Shiv Bhole CGHS society in Sector 7, Dwarka. Kalka CGHS in Sector 6, Dwarka has a similar tale to tell with Rs 2 per unit being saved by each household. \u201cAt present, the solar capacity is 50kW. If the requirement is of 200 units and we produce 220 units, we receive surplus benefits of Rs 5 per unit,\u201d said SS Rawat, president of the housing society. Rawat said a feasibility test was carried out by the discom last year to ascertain the rooftop potential. \u201cAfter calculating the average of the bills in the society, they informed us that 50kW would be sufficient and we installed that capacity,\u201d he added. Kamal Vihar CGHS in Sector 7, where the installed solar capacity is 200kW, has been reaping the most benefits. BSES said the annual savings there are Rs 18.52 lakh in cash and over 2.5 lakh electricity units. Joy Apartments in Sector 2, meanwhile, has a capacity of 120kW and annual savings of Rs 11.11 lakh. \u201cThe network has slowly been expanding and now more societies want to install the solar panels.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The government informed Justice Najmi Waziri that till date only 3,500 saplings have been planted and another 2,500 would be planted by the end of the week. The court, thereafter, observed, \u201cI see a lot of recalcitrance at your (forest department) end.\u201d The move would bring the total to 6,000 as against the 30,000 saplings, which were to be planted in the first phase by June 15 according to the high court\u2019s May 30 order. The court further noted that the forest authority was \u201csitting pretty\u201d on it as if the lives of Delhiites did not matter. \u201cLook how hot it is in the city. Quit stalling and do it,\u201d the court said. The forest department had said that after the May 30 order, it had surveyed the Central Ridge for additional sites to plant the saplings and could identify only 2,500 more pockets. It added that watering of saplings in these pockets could only be done manually. Therefore, it sought permission to plant the remaining saplings in the Southern Ridge. The court, however, said that saplings could also be planted near existing trees where the top soil would be thicker or deeper. It directed the forest department to plant 5,000 more saplings in the Central Ridge and around 50,000 in the Southern Ridge. The state government has assured HC that its directions to plant 1.4 lakh saplings in the Central Ridge will be implemented. The government\u2019s stand came after the court warned of contempt action against forest department officials for non-compliance of its order. HC\u2019s order to plant 1.4 lakh saplings came on a plea filed by pharma major Merck Sharp and Dohme seeking contempt action against Indian drug company Venkatanarayana Active Ingredients Pvt Ltd for breach of judicial orders not to manufacture and sell diabetes medication under the brand names used by MSD.

Launched in 2017, this first-of-its-kind project was introduced at 42 NDMC schools in collaboration with the Quality Council of India (QCI) for five years. It included various learning outcome tools to improve the performances of the students and the teachers to bring them on a par with other schools. Unlike other schemes launched in these schools, which concentrated only on the weaker students, this project focussed on evaluating the teachers as well, said a senior NDMC official. \u201cThe concept was introduced after reports of decline in both their performances started to sprout. To begin with, we decided to train them as elementary education is crucial for doing well at all other levels,\u201d said an NDMC spokesperson. He also emphasised that the children need to have a good understanding of their subjects and teachers the ability to explain diligently. Since its launch, 25-30% of the teachers and students falling in the lowest categories have shown an upward trend in 2017-18 and 2018-19, said an official from NDMC\u2019s education department. \u201cWe have now decided to introduce the programme at the primary level as it will help improve the basics in the children, most of whom can\u2019t even write the alphabets properly,\u201d he added. Under the project, a monthly growth chart of the participants is shared with the head of the department and the information is also uploaded on NDMC\u2019s app \u2018Amavik\u2019, which can be accessed by the teachers to track their performance. \u201cHowever, we plan to attach this app with NDMC 311 and make the information public so that parents can also see the performance graph of their children easily,\u201d the official added. About the projectThe programme is divided into three phases \u2014 pre-intervention, intervention and post-intervention. Students and teachers are observed and assessed by experts affiliated to QCI, who have worked as principals in Kendriya Vidyalaya and DIET. \u201cThe experts visit the classes randomly and observe the teachers and their communication skill. They also give suggestions about the study material and the methods to improve the performance of the students,\u201d a QCI official said. The experts suggested that teachers use simpler examples and arrange more group discussions or activities to help children, especially the ones who were below average. \u201cAt the end of the session, the QCI team visits these classes again to monitor the changes in their teaching ability,\u201d said the QCI official. The students and teachers are simultaneously asked to participate in different classroom activities, and based on their performance the report card is prepared and different categories are formed. For example, students of classes V-VIII were grouped in four categories \u2014 A, B, C and D \u2014 indicating performance of the students from high to low. Similarly, the teachers were clubbed into three categories \u2014 A, B and C. \u201cThe experts rate the teachers and students before the start of the academic year and then categorise them towards the end of the year,\u201d said the NDMC official.

Workers at the site said the two private contractors overseeing the construction had forced them to get into the ditch despite the soil being loose. Angoori (24), a construction worker, took along her three-year-old child, Monika, with her into the ditch as there was no one to look after her. Angoori, her husband Guddu (25) and Monika were all trapped under the soil along with two other labourers \u2014 Babulal (35) and Bari (55). The cave-in took place at the construction site of a private building in Knowledge Park area around 11.45am. An excavator had just dug a ditch to lay the foundation for the building when the two contractors \u2014 Lalit and Kapil Bhadana \u2014 asked six of their workers to get inside the 6ft ditch and level the walls manually. As both Angoori and Guddu were ordered to get inside, they could not have left Monika alone. \u201cMinutes before the accident, an earthmover had dug up the area. After this, the contractors asked a bunch of workers to get inside the ditch and level the walls. This seemed risky, but the contractors forced the workers,\u201d said Rajkumar, Angoori\u2019s brother. He said the workers had told the two contractors that the soil was loose, but they refused to budge. \u201cThere was a pile of debris that needed to be excavated, but the contractor, without realising the odds, forced the workers inside the ditch. The walls collapsed within minutes and fell on the workers. The adults survived, but Monika succumbed to her injuries. My sister and brother-in-law, too, suffered injuries in the head and chest,\u201d Rajkumar added. The victims were rushed to Sharda Hospital, where the child was declared dead on arrival, while others were admitted for treatment of injuries. The two contractors have been booked under sections 304A (causing death by negligence) on a complaint by Rajkumar. \u201cThe contractors \u2014 Lalit and Kapil Bhadana \u2014 fled the spot soon after the accident.

These men in blue, representing the Indian Wheelchair Cricket (IWC) team, was in Dwarka on Tuesday to play a six-over match against Delhi Police to mark the beginning of a four-day cricket tournament, Indian Wheelchair Cricket Premier League (IWPL). There are eight teams comprising 120 players representing different states in the competition that has been modelled after the Indian Premier League or IPL. \u201cThe tournament is in its second year now. In its first year, we had six teams competing against each other. We hope to expand it further next year,\u201d said tournament organiser Vinod Thakur. The 29-year-old is a disabled dancer and athlete who had shot to fame after his participation in television dance reality show Nach Baliye. Thakur, who has been associated with IWPL since its inception, said the biggest challenge was to bring together disabled people to showcase their talent. \u201cNo sponsor wants to invest in wheelchair cricket because they are not sure of the returns they will get. But wheelchair cricket is growing across India and 16 states have their teams now. These matches ensure visibility and change the perception society has of disabled people,\u201d Thakur added. Even though the men playing in the tournament admit that the fight for recognition and dignity is far from over, for many of them playing cricket has been a way of reclaiming their lost self-confidence. Radheshyam (29) is playing for Delhi in IWPL. He remembers losing sensation in his legs when he was just eight. His muscles began to weaken and he was confined to bed for a few weeks before he was diagnosed with polio. \u201cI was paralysed waist-down because of polio. After I lost my legs, people began to doubt if I will achieve anything in life,\u201d said Radheshyam, who is from a small village in Madhya Pradesh. He was selected for the Delhi team by IWPL organisers who set up camps in different states to scout for talented sportsmen. For the other men, too, playing cricket is a way to assert that they are capable of achieving much more than what people believe. Devender Kumar (23), who was selected from Haryana to represent Uttar Pradesh, said when they began playing four years ago, there used to be no spectators. \u201cWe came to know of wheelchair cricket from social media almost four years ago. At that time, we did not even have a state team. But several NGOs got together to provide us support. They got us wheelchairs and raised awareness. When we first began to play, nobody came to watch. We were the spectators, cheerleaders and the trainers. We learnt by watching YouTube, but things have changed since then and today we manage to change the mindset of people with each match,\u201d he said, adding that IWPL is a platform for state-level cricketers to get selected for the Indian team. Wheelchair cricket has gained popularity over the last few years. The Indian wheelchair cricket team recently went to Nepal to play the Asia Cup, which began on May 15 and saw Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and India compete. India lost to Pakistan in the final held on May 19. Ramesh Sartrape, the captain of the Indian team, who is also heading Team Mumbai in IWPL, had led the Indian side during the Asia Cup. Sartrape, who has been playing in the national team since 2015, was paralysed waist-down due to polio. But he says he has managed to leave behind his fears and inhibitions by playing for India. Sartrape, who also helped form the wheelchair cricket association in Maharashtra in 2017, is confident that wheelchair cricket will gain popularity in India. \u201cPeople often doubt disabled people. We faced many challenges but we have managed to put all of that behind us. With every match, we give out a message: Never give up,\u201d he said. Tuesday\u2019s match had IWC set a 47-run target for the Delhi Police team, which won the match in the last over.

Cops from Bhowanipore arrived around 10-15 minutes later.

They called cops, who came and asked her to file an FIR at the Charu Market police station. It was 1.30 a.m. when she reached there but, instead of taking down her complaint, the cops there directed her to Bhowanipore police station where the first assault had occured. \u201cI just gave up and started shouting at this point. There was no female police officer. The officer there finally took down my complaint after asking a lot of questions but refused to take the cabby\u2019s complaint, stating that two FIR could not be taken for the same incident,\u201d she said. Frustrated and hapless, she returned home. It was at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday that she posted the entire ordeal on Facebook along with a 20-second video clip.

Defined as a plan for a ward or a sub-zone of the city, it was meant to be an enabler for a fourth level of planning \u2014 after the master, zonal and layout plans \u2014 which empowered the local bodies to make and implement improvements in the local area, particularly in each ward and sub-zone or colony with participation of residents and their RWAs. But during the past 12 years, very little has been done either RWAs or the three corporations for implementing improvements using the LAP planning tool. Creating proper pedestrian pathways connecting local shopping centres within colonies is one such need. As old, single-family homes are rapidly giving way to stilt-plusfour floors \u2014 a practice which became popular after the stilt parking concept was allowed in this master plan \u2014 traffic and on-street parking issues have begun to plague most Delhi colonies. There is now a need to rework the pedestrian walkways within the colony, recreate cycle tracks and find ways to eliminate the conflict between people and vehicles. Even within the local shopping centres and colony markets, increasing pedestrian space is now more important than ever before. Attempts made by the municipal bodies and councillors to improve the pedestrian\u2019s experience have been limited to using concrete pavers and planters. Very little work has been done on the drawing board to achieve proper pedestrianisation. Lessons can be drawn from the Connaught Place experiment (post construction of the Delhi Metro station at Rajiv Chowk that replaced the old central lawn of CP). The municipal body increased the area meant for pedestrian traffic in the inner ring around the CP shopping area, introduced better planned parking spaces, increased the green cover with hardy trees and bushes and segregated the walking areas from vehicular traffic spaces with green cover and bollards. Elsewhere \u2013 particularly on the roads leading to the shopping areas \u2014 the pedestrian pathways were segregated from the road tops with hardy hedges fed with drip irrigation and table-top speed breakers to slow down the vehicular traffic. Learnings from the CP experience were then used in other markets like Khan Market, Bengali Market and Malcha Market. In some shopping districts, the open pathways in front of the shops were widened to give way to more pedestrian walkways and seating in stone and steel were added. But somehow the CP experience was not replicated by the three municipal corporations which administer a large area of Delhi \u2014 not many MCD markets have looked at pedestrianisation the way NDMC did \u2014 both within the market areas and on the roads leading to them. While this is indeed a pity \u2014 especially in a city which has a pleasant weather for seven months \u2014 there is still time to implement the LAP system. Action must start now before our colonies end up like Karol Bagh. It is time we looked at pedestrianisation and connectivity in the wards and colonies seriously. The last-mile connectivity provided by the now popular e-rickshaws also needs to be incorporated in LAP. The LAP process has, perhaps, been ignored because the three municipal bodies lack professional in-house capacity to engage with the stakeholder residents, draw up plans, discuss them with RWAs, seek and get consensus and take the all other steps which LAP mandated in MPD 2021 . LAP is a participatory process and cannot succeed without the involvement of residents. It needs ideas, discussing them in depth in stakeholder consultations, making detailed drawings and illustrating them with examples on the ground. This is not a new planning tool. It existed in Europe and UK around a century ago when it was realised that a democratic and participatory approach to the local area\u2019s planning needs are the only way forward to satisfying the needs and aspirations of the community.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option. We need to see how this will pan out.\" In Video:Bill seeking to lift green card cap amended to protect US workersDownload The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."}, "Bollywood actors who would be great teachers": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/bollywood-actors-who-would-be-great-teachers/photostory/65684334.cms", "description": ""}, "Samsung": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/heres-how-samsung-got-mocked-for-its-social-media-post/articleshow/69835890.cms", "description": ""}, "Delhi traffic cop spreads road safety awareness with rap songs": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//videos/city/delhi/delhi-traffic-cop-spreads-road-safety-awareness-with-rap-songs/videoshow/69851739.cms", "description": ""}, "India's Most Wanted: Promotions": {"time": "", "link": "http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/events/delhi/indias-most-wanted-promotions/articleshow/69446717.cms", "description": ""}, "Kenyan woman stabbed to death at her home in Delhi": {"datetime": "", "time": "2019-06-18 21:44:00", "description": "NEW DELHI: A Kenyan woman was found stabbed to death at her Chhatarpur Extension house in South Delhi, police said on Tuesday.

After killing him, the accused had wrapped his business partner\u2019s body in a curtain and hidden it in his shop. The body was discovered three days later when a foul smell started emanating from it.

The body of a man, whose age was estimated to be around 35 years, had injury marks on the head and a cloth wrapped around the neck. Bloodstains were also found on the staircase of the shop and the deceased was identified to be Mohit Kaushal. The victim\u2019s wife stated that the accused owed her husband Rs 24 lakh. The prosecution argued that the accused fleeing after the incident proved that he was running away from the law. On the other hand, the defence counsel argued that the case was based on circumstantial evidence and it had not been proved that Rajpal was seen with Kaushal. The defence counsel also claimed that it was the deceased who owed money to Rajpal and had not repaid it despite several reminders. The court, however, observed that the accused had called the deceased on the morning of September 19, 2014 \u2014 the day of the murder \u2014 and asked him to come to his shop. Taking note of the evidence in hand, it concluded that Kaushal was last present with Rajpal. \u201cOther discussions also provide additional links in the chain of circumstantial evidence,\u201d ASJ Sharma observed.

Singh has been booked in three cases of disrupting public order since 2006, the latest one in April this year when he allegedly thrashed a sewadar of Bangla Sahib Gurdwara and was arrested. After injuring policemen with the sword, Singh and his minor son were overpowered, beaten up and dragged on the road by the cops on Sunday, leading to violent protests in which at least 12 people, including an ACP, were injured. Police said Singh has been unable to produce a copy of his driving licence or a commercial permit for his vehicle. Cops will also issue a challan against Singh for allowing his minor son to drive.

Delhi Police has sent an interim report to the home ministry on the incident on Monday and a final report is awaited. Cops have collected different videos on the incident and are studying these. A parallel probe is under way to identify those in the mob who had attacked policemen outside the police station on Sunday night. Mukherjee Nagar clash: Police in capital have neither training nor equipment to deal with violenceIn his complaint to the police in April, the sewadar, Mangal Singh, had said that they had found Singh and his son lying on the stairs of the tank at the gurdwara. They had been staying there for three days and having food from the langar (community kitchen). When the gurdwara authorities spotted them, they asked the sewadars to bring the two to the office. Mangal and his colleague, Shallu, approached Singh and asked him to accompany them to the office. \u201cHe, initially, refused but was persuaded. However, his son suddenly started walking towards the exit. When we tried to stop him, Singh caught my arm and twisted it,\u201d said Mangal. Singh then pushed him to the ground and attacked him. Shallu and the other sewadars managed to push Singh away but he allegedly kept hurling abuses. Mangal had to be admitted to Ram Manohar Hospital for treatment. Later, a case of causing hurt and criminal intimidation was registered against Singh and he was jailed for a few days. After this, he shifted from Sant Nagar near Burari in north Delhi and began staying with his father at Gandhi Vihar, close to Mukherjee Nagar. In 2006, cops had booked him under CrPC sections related to apprehension of breach of peace and arrest to prevent a cognizable offence at Burari after he fell out with his neighbours at Sant Nagar. He had allegedly threatened a few neighbours during a petty fight. A similar case was also registered against him at the Timarpur police station in 2013 after he got into a brawl with a group of men at the gurdwara near Majnu Ka Tila. In 2011, he had got into a verbal spat with sewadars at Bangla Sahib Gurdwara. His neighbours said most people kept a distance from the family due to Singh\u2019s tendency to pick up fights. \u201cSince he has started staying with his father here at Gandhi Nagar, he had got into verbal spats with many over petty issues such as parking and festive celebrations. We avoid interacting with the family,\u201d said a woman who stays close to the Singhs. A probe has revealed that the Gramin Sewa vehicle which he was driving was registered with one Bhola Nath, a resident of Gandhi Vihar. Cops found that the vehicle did not have a fitness certificate.

It will be a keenly fought battle between Tamilisai and DMK\u2019s state women wing secretary and Rajya Sabha MP K Kanimozhi in Tuticorin. Though Tamilisai initially preferred to contest from Chennai South, which has a sizeable votebank for the party, she finally settled for Tuticorin. AIADMK was keen on retaining south Chennai for sitting MP, J Jayavardhan, son of fisheries minister D Jayakumar. Former TN BJP chief Radhakrishnan will face CPM\u2019s P R Natarajan in Coimbatore. This is the fifth time that Radhakrishnan has been fielded in Coimbatore, a BJP stronghold. While he won two consecutive Lok Sabha elections in 1998 and 1999, he was defeated in the 2004 and 2014 polls. Nainar Nagendran has been pitted against DMK\u2019s IUML candidate K Nawaz Kani. While the party made a quick decision on candidates for four constituencies, Ramanathapuram delayed matters considering the keen contest for the seat among some senior leaders.

After chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the scheme a fortnight ago, the AAP government has held a series of meetings with officials of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and the transport department. A final proposal may be submitted before the Delhi cabinet soon. Implementing the scheme in DTC and cluster buses is likely to be a straightforward proposition, but doing so in metro involves quite a few complications. \u201cThe cabinet\u2019s nod is sufficient for enforcing the plan in buses,\u201d a government source confirmed. According to DMRC, the free travel for women in metro will entail an annual expenditure of Rs 1,566.6 crore. It has submitted two proposals to the government in this regard: while one involves incorporating the changes in the DMRC software as well as smart cards, the other requires women to purchase special tokens at ticket windows or via vending machines. Both proposals may take eight to 12 months to be implemented, DMRC officials believe, meaning which a lot of ground has to be covered before the proposal even comes before the cabinet for clearance. Metro will need to set up a fare-fixation committee to consider the proposals, which will then be forwarded to the DMRC board. With assembly elections due early next year, the government is keen on pushing the scheme. Sources said government surveys to know people\u2019s views on the issue had thrown up encouraging results. Some AAP MLAs claimed that over 99% of the women they had interacted with in their respective assembly constituencies had given positive feedback on the proposal. According to the plan under consideration, women who wish to avail of free rides will need to buy tickets on the bus, but these will come for free. \u201cThe tickets will mention that the cost has been waived off by the Delhi government,\u201d a source said.

How CCTVs helped Delhi zoo with census": {"datetime": "", "time": "2019-06-19 05:43:00", "description": "NEW DELHI: CCTV cameras are in much use at Delhi\u2019s National Zoological Park these days. They have helped the zoo authorities to finally carry out the census of animals ordered by Delhi high court in April, and will now be installed in enclosures to keep tabs on not only the animals, but also the staff and the visitors. CCTV cameras were uniquely used for the first time to determine the number of zoo animals, particularly nocturnal and burrowing animals which the zoo authorities said could have been hard to track if normal procedures for counting were followed. The high court had ordered completion of the census within two weeks, but the results were delayed all this while. \u201cWe wanted to carry out a comprehensive audit, and so the delay,\u201d Renu Singh, director, Delhi zoo, told TOI. \u201cWe studied CCTV footage and determined the number of burrowing animals that had gone underground. CCTV cameras also helped us detect a fox birth that we had not seen earlier.\u201d According to officials, 13 CCTV cameras were used interchangeably at different enclosures for the census. They were also used to number the deer population at the zoo. \u201cSince there is a large number of deer and they are in one large enclosure, we used CCTV cameras to arrive at their exact number,\u201d said Singh. The recorded footage also yielded information on the feeding patterns and the behaviour after lights went off of certain animals such as jackals and monitor lizards. This boost to information collection has inspired the zoo to install 256 CCTV cameras by the end of the financial year. The Rs 5-crore project is aimed at keeping track of animals, zoo staff and to ensure visitors do not violate rules. \u201cWe will know more about our staff, their whereabouts, what visitors are doing and where a particular animal is located at any point of time. Instances of visitors throwing items in the enclosures, like in the past, can also be tracked,\u201d explained Singh. Delhi high court rapped the zoo for irregularities in animal data and irregularities in post-mortem reports and finances. On April 9, it directed the zoo to carry out an animal census and even granted police protection after the zoo officials pleaded that its own staff was obstructing the count. The court observed, \u201cThere is absolute lawlessness prevailing in the national zoo of the country\u2026 The records are being manipulated and tampered with, and the statutory body is not being allowed to perform its assigned duties. The death of animals is being suppressed.\u201d The court added that the lack of action by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change following the Central\u2019s Zoo Authority\u2019s 2016 reports had led to the deteriorating situation in Delhi zoo.

Lakhs get stuck on the arterial Aurobindo Marg not only because of the traffic volume, especially at peak hours, but also because of encroachments, illegally parked vehicles and the road design. There\u2019s respite for them in the offing: the Public Works Department plans to decongest the road with two underpasses and an elevated corridor. PWD officials disclosed that each of the two underpasses will be 500 metres long. The first one dives under the IIT flyover to open up at Essex Farm, while the second begins on Mehrauli-Badarpur Road and goes below its intersection with Aurobindo Marg. They will be six lanes wide, three on either side. To avoid the constricted length towards Adchini, PWD will also construct a 3-km-long elevated corridor with six lanes from Mother\u2019s International School to Mehrauli Archaeological Park. The Rs 900-crore project will benefit commuters coming from and going towards Mehrauli, the site for the Qutub Minar complex, RK Puram, Gurugram, Aya Nagar and Panchsheel Enclave. According to PWD officials, once the project is cleared, construction work will take a year for completion. Encroachments along Aurobindo Marg continue to slow down traffic despite the corrective measures taken by PWD and traffic police. These encroachments, the pedestrian crossings near AIIMS and the rows of cars parked near Adchini crossing create bottlenecks for the commuters. There are several residential colonies in the area and around 800 small and big commercial establishments. According to PWD officials, more than 2.5 lakh vehicles ply on the road every day, and 7,000 are parked on either sides of the carriageway. The earlier interventions, including a U-turn around 50 metres from Aurobindo Market, have only created choke points. The U-turn near the exit gate of AIIMS has added to the mess. The creation of the U-turn in the middle of the road drastically reduced the road width and left it prone to accidents. In the short distance between Nili Masjid and Yusuf Sarai, therefore, vehicles are forced to slow down three times. The U-turn at Aurobindo Market is now notorious for vehicles from Green Park approaching it from the wrong side of the road. The two traffic signals and an unmanned cut for pedestrians bunched together between AIIMS and Green Park have rendered what was once a clear passage into a clogged one. The traffic jams at these points have lengthy tailbacks that are aggravated by parking assistants further down the road taking up much of the space to create a separate lane to park vehicles, according to sources. PWD officials said that the civic authorities regularly request the residents and shop owners not to park their vehicles on the roadside, but there is little compliance. PWD officials said the construction of the new underpasses and the elevated roadway would clear the area of jams, while making more space available for vehicles. \u201cEven though a lot of regulatory steps were enforced on the stretch, the traffic situation was never eased,\u201d an official conceded. \u201cRealising that the situation was only worsening and people had to endure endless traffic jams here, the proposal of constructing the underpasses and elevated segment was considered.\u201d After completion, the stretch will be beautified and the security enhanced with CCTV cameras.

Analysis of the video footage of the incident by senior officers has revealed that the basic protocols of policing were violated. Most of it is due to poor training. Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar clash: What followed after video went viralSome officers said the moment a plainclothesman had overpowered Sarabjeet Singh, others should have helped to handcuff him. That didn\u2019t happen and Singh was not disarmed. 3 cops suspended after clash with tempo driver in Delhi's Mukherjee NagarAnyone familiar with American TV shows or Hollywood movies will know how police forces in the US tackle suspects: they are asked to put their hands behind their backs so that they can handcuffed, and the Miranda Rights are read out to them (where a policeman says, \u201cYou have the right to remain silent.\u201d). If the suspect is violent, Tasers or stun guns are used to shock him into submission. Cops clash with mini-bus driver in north Delhi's Mukherjee NagarContrast this with the approach of Delhi Police and one realises that the learning curve is quite steep for the police force. The right kind of equipment is also not there with the police. Situations such as this require non-lethal riot gear. In 2015, Delhi Police had planned to procure Tasers. These are weapons that deliver electric shocks to disrupt the voluntary control of muscles. A few demonstrators had been procured as well, but nothing moved beyond that. A senior officer opined that Singh shouldn\u2019t have been attacked with a pistol butt or sticks after he was pinned down. \u201cThe policemen should have used a vehicle to contain him and his son instead of carrying them by their limbs,\u201d he added. Hitting someone with a pistol butt is also very risky as the gun could go off accidentally if it\u2019s cocked. \u201cForce is used to take a suspect into custody. Excessive use of force after capture is unprofessional. The way the policemen were trying to catch the suspect and beating him without disarming him shows that they are unequipped for close combat,\u201d the officer said. Another retired officer said policemen these days often get carried away while countering attacks and involve themselves in fights instead of trying to control or subdue the subjects. On Sunday as well, the constables who had tried to restrain Singh and his son had started attacking them with a vengeance after they saw him hit a senior officer with a sword. \u201cThe objective was to pin him down and take him to the police station. Instead, they got busy hitting him which was unprofessional,\u201d said another officer. The police were also slammed for carrying Singh away by his limbs. As per protocol, even if a suspect is restrained right outside the police station, it is imperative for the police to use a vehicle to contain him and drive him in.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

She claimed that several rules were being flouted at the law faculty, but she was not assisted by the university in taking action against them. Her tenure was to end in September. Speaking to TOI, the dean said that while the DU vice-chancellor has asked her to reconsider her decision, she will stand by her resignation as she was sure there would never be any resolution to the problems at law faculty. \u201cI was contemplating about resigning for long as I was frustrated,\u201d she added. Kumari, who sent her resignation letter to the VC on June 14, blamed the illegal and arbitrary actions of the professor in-charge (PIC), Campus Law Center, for her inability to secure the best interests of the Faculty of Law in the last two years and nine months. \u201cI failed to ensure justice to hardworking students who attend classes regularly as now those with attendance as low as 31% are being permitted to take the exam. Such students are also being given marks for attending tutorials at the institutional level, which have not been held. Fake records are being maintained,\u201d the dean alleged.

In her letter, she claimed that she failed to get promotions due for teachers or get them rooms in Umang Bhawan, the new building. She also failed to invite an experienced professional from abroad for essential training of teachers in Clinical Legal Education. She couldn\u2019t take action on the recommendations of the disciplinary committee regarding the student who physically assaulted a teacher. The alleged assault took place on the teacher\u2019s comments after the Pulwama attack. The dean stated in her letter that the list of problems at law faculty is much longer. \u201cAll these and many other matters have been repeatedly brought to the notice of university authorities with the request for necessary action through written reminders, telephonic calls and messages, and personal meetings. However, none have resulted in any action. I have repeatedly felt embarrassed and humiliated at no action and no response to my calls, letters, reminders and personal meetings,\u201d she added.

The capital, which has been fond of the king of fruits right from the time of the Mughals, also looks forward to the various mango festivals that are organised during this time of the year. One of them is the Mango Mela organised by the West Bengal government. In its seventh edition this year, the festival allowed Delhiites to savour some of the best-known varieties from Bengal\u2014langda, himsagar and mallika. These come from the Malda, Bankura and Murshidabad districts. The festival is on at Handloom Haat in Janpath till June 30 and has been organised by the West Bengal government\u2019s department of food processing, industries and horticulture. The most popular mango variety at the mela is himsagar. It is large and sweet and has been brought by farmers from Malda and Murshidabad. The cost per kilogram ranges from Rs 80 to Rs 120. Among the stock from Bankura district, amrapali is the best known. These have ochre-coloured flesh and are high in sugar content and low on fibre. These are also very popular, \u201cnot just in Bankura but in Delhi as well\u201d, said a seller. Bankura\u2019s other famous mango is mallika. This one is a hybrid of two Indian varieties, neelum and dussehri. It comes during the middle of the mango season. Langda is common to all the three districts and is low in fibre content. The festival timings are from 11am to 8pm. And apart from mangoes, people can also buy handlooms, kurtas and other wares from Bengal.

DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwah said that a trap was laid after they received information that the kingpin of a gang from Moradabad, which was involved in eight robberies since last year, would come to Delhi. \u201cThe accused, identified as Mohammad Mujeeb, was arrested by the team. He had been changing base frequently to evade arrest,\u201d said DCP Kushwah. He allegedly went to Moradabad from Delhi after the arrest of his associates. A team was sent to Moradabad to get information about his hideouts. Mujeeb then shifted base to Ahmadabad. The team too went to Ahmadabad to trace him, but he kept changing his hideouts. Finally, his location was traced to Sarai Kale Khan when he was on way to meet an associate, who had been recently released from jail. One pistol and a stolen motorcycle were seized from him. Mujeeb told cops that he came to Delhi and joined a tailoring shop that was being run by his uncle. During that time he fell in love with a girl and wanted to earn lots of money to impress her. He came to know that traders of Gandhi Nagar and Tank Road carried huge cash with them. He then started robbing them. Mujeeb formed a gang with criminals from Moradabad and northeast Delhi. His gang members were identified as Mohammad Taj, Mohammad Kasif, Phool Babu, Bharat, Daud, Shavaj and Faisal. Faisal and Shavaj used to collect information about probable targets.

The survey was conducted by party MLAs, councillors and members of AAP\u2019s women wing in different parts of the city. The exercise spanned 10 days. Earlier this month, the AAP government had announced its plan to allow free rides for women in Delhi Metro and DTC and cluster buses.

A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi.

He then slammed the Delhi BJP for raising questions on power rates in the capital while ignoring the \u201cproposed hike\u201d in the BJP-ruled neighbouring state. In fact, UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) has recommended an overall 20% increase in power tariffs across slabs. The highest increase of 26% has been recommended for the lowest slab of 0-150 units\u2014from the existing Rs 4.9 per unit to Rs 6.2. In the 151-300 units slab, the proposed hike is to Rs 6.5 per unit against the existing Rs 5.4. UPPCL has also suggested a hike in fixed charges from Rs 90 per KW to Rs 110. If the hike is implemented, then monthly power bills will go up substantially. For instance, a bill of Rs 3,000 today would be Rs 4,000 post-hike. Sisodia said the hike will make life miserable for people in UP \u201cwho already pay through their nose for electricity\u201d. \u201cIt is quite shocking that at a time when BJP is trying to rake up the issue of power tariffs in Delhi, the BJP government in UP is hiking tariffs by 26%. BJP protests in Delhi about power while its own government in UP is supplying five times more expensive power,\u201d Sisodia said at a press conference. \u201cDelhi government has been successful in maintaining the cheapest power tariffs in the country for the last four and a half years. In fact, Delhi is the only state in the country that has not allowed a single increase in tariffs for four successive years,\u201d Sisodia said. The deputy CM called BJP\u2019s recent protests \u201chypocrisy\u201d. \u201cBJP is displaying blatant hypocrisy on the issue. Even though power is cheapest in Delhi as compared to the entire country, BJP leaders are protesting over rates. Wherever BJP is in power it is looting the people in the name of power bills. BJP leaders should focus on stopping the open loot of the people of UP,\u201d he said. Sisodia also compared the power prices in Delhi with UP, especially the NCR cities of Noida and Ghaziabad. \u201cIn Delhi, 200 units of electricity cost Rs 200 at Re 1 per unit. In UP, for up to 150 units, the rate is Rs 4.9, and from 150-300 units the rate is as high as Rs 5.4 per unit. In Delhi for 400 units, the rate is Rs 2.5 per unit, and in Noida it is Rs 6.2 per unit.\u201d BJP called Sisodia\u2019s claims \u201cfake stories\u201d. \u201cChief minister Arvind Kejriwal with his team is busy concocting fake stories at a time when a large number of people in different parts of the city are deprived of water.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs.

The child was raped near her home in Bawana by a 45-year-old neighbour. He was caught by locals and handed over to the police. The child was taken to Maharishi Valmiki Hospital in Rohini by police where she required examination under general anaesthesia, which wasn\u2019t available in the hospital.

They started arguing and would not take no for an answer. Before anything could be done to assuage them, a crowd barged into the emergency and created a ruckus,\u201d said a source. The attack came in the aftermath of several such attacks on doctors across the country, including a recent one at AIIMS, which led to a nationwide strike. CCTV cameras at the hospital captured the incident and a clip of it went viral on social media. The footage showed a group of men trying to enter the hospital ward forcibly and being stopped by guards. They clashed with the guards while others started throwing furniture. A few others were also seen smashing things with their helmets. The situation was brought under control after police personnel present at the hospital intervened. An investigation has started. Meanwhile, DCP (outer-north) Gaurav Sharma said the rapist, a labourer, was arrested and booked under POCSO Act, and he will be produced before a magistrate. Investigation revealed that the girl was playing outside her house in the evening when the labourer took her away to a desolate spot and sexually assaulted her.
