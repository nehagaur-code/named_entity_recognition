During the phone-in event at the SP\u2019s office, a senior citizen complained that when he had gone to Udupi town police station to enquire about his passport, the police personnel did not behave respectfully with him. In response to this, she assured of training the police to be polite and friendly with the public. She added, \u201cThe training will be mainly for the \u2018swagathagararu\u2019 (receptionist) in the station, aiming to focus on how police personnel should behave with senior citizens, children, and women, who come to the police station for various reasons, including to file a complaint, for passport enquiry and other reasons.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. He defeated Congress's Ramnaraian Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently concluded general election. He has also been elected to Rajasthan assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. Birla will succeed eight-term MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this will not be for the first time a relative newcomer will hold the position. In 1996, TDP leader G M C Balayogi was also a two-time MP when he was elected as the LS Speaker and after his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and the first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

The work on the project worth Rs 54.69 crore began in 2013, but is still not completed. A major reason was a change of project coordinates mid-way, due to which the project could not be completed with the allocated funds. The scam came to light after a letter from director, ports and inland water transport department, surfaced, asking the fisheries director to conduct a Lokayukta inquiry into the matter. In a letter dated, February 18, which is in possession of TOI, disciplinary action against officials involved in the project has been suggested, since Rs 54.69 crore has been wasted on it. The project was launched after the executive engineer of fisheries department had paid Rs 21.3 lakh to Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS), Pune, for the blueprint. Similarly, Mumbai-based Sea Bird Services was paid Rs 6.12 lakh for the Bathymetric charts. Based on these estimates and blueprints, the department sought administrative approval. The technical approval was sought from the chief engineer, public works, ports and inland water transport. Tenders were invited and works were awarded to NSK Builders Private Limited, Tamil Nadu. The projects progress was reported to the fisheries department. However, a change in design was allegedly made by the officials executing the project, without assigning a reason for doing so. The complainant states that higher officials who observed this change sent notices to officials involved, questioning the rationale behind the change in design. The director, ports and inland water transport, suggested that a Lokayukta probe should be ordered into the project, since there is no clarity whether approval was taken by the officials to increase the total project cost, apart from change of design. The recent development is that a top official from the department of ports has said that the project has been abandoned. CWPRS, Pune, had designed this project to protect boats from strong waves. The officials involved in the project extended the breakwater length to 1,150 meters, an extra 200 meters than prescribed in the original design, which meant additional expenditure of Rs 42 crore. \u201cThe government had not approved the extra sum. Why the design was changed, remains unanswered,\u201d an official said. The approval and technical sanction for the project was received in 2011-12, and the project with a 36-month deadline, commenced on March 20, 2013.

Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

The last round of harassment occurred after cops at a police station \u201crefused to register her complaint\u201d but, instead, referred her to the \u201cright police station\u201d.   Cops from Bhowanipore arrived around 10-15 minutes later. It was past midnight by then and Sengupta decided to pursue the case on Tuesday morning and requested the cabby to drop her colleague and her off at their homes. But the nightmare was far from being over. \u201cThe boys had followed us till my colleague\u2019s house and, right when we were dropping him at Lake Gardens, six of them on three bikes came and stopped the car.

The boys then fled,\u201d Sengupta recalled.   She then called her father and sister; her own residence was just a lane away. They called cops, who came and asked her to file an FIR at the Charu Market police station. It was 1.30 a.m. when she reached there but, instead of taking down her complaint, the cops there directed her to Bhowanipore police station where the first assault had occured. \u201cI just gave up and started shouting at this point. There was no female police officer. The officer there finally took down my complaint after asking a lot of questions but refused to take the cabby\u2019s complaint, stating that two FIR could not be taken for the same incident,\u201d she said. Frustrated and hapless, she returned home. It was at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday that she posted the entire ordeal on Facebook along with a 20-second video clip. An additional CP later called Sengupta and assured her of strong action against not just the accused but an inquiry into police refusal to take her complaint citing jurisdiction issues. \u201cThe probe has just begun and we have identified all the culprits. More arrests are likely and we will probe whether there was lack of adequate response from cops,\u201d said a Lalbazar official. The arrested were identified as Sheikh Rahit, Fardeen Khan, Sheikh Shabir Ali, Sheikh Gani, Sheikh Imran Ali, Sheikh Wasim and Atif Khan alias Md Samsad. A preliminary inquiry revealed the cab had accidentally brushed against the bike, causing the riders to lose balance. One of the bikes\u2019 rear view mirrors broke and the youths accosted cabby Tarak Debnath to demand compensation. At least two more bikes and an auto carrying more people landed there, leading to the sequence of events ending with the assault at Lake Gardens, officials said.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option.

However, a 48-year-old farmer, Ganapathi, took it as a challenge and invented ingenious bike like equipment (driven by a motor) seated on which a person can easily climb upto the top of vertical areca nut tree for spraying pesticides and plucking. Watch: Ganapathi Bhat, a farmer from Sajipamooda village, has developed a machine that helps in climbing areca nut\u2026 https://t.co/CwhCgI3CBL&mdash; TOI Mangaluru (@TOIMangalore) 1560755845000Climbing areca nut tree is considered essential for spraying pesticides in the rainy season and for plucking (harvesting crop) at the end of the year. Traditionally, in India, the plantation farmers tie ropes around their feet to climb the coconut or areca nut trees, without any safety equipment. Areca tree is generally 100 feet tall in height and stands vertical to the ground. In the backdrop of fact that there is a shortage of labour while the demand for traditional tree climber is on rise for spraying pesticides, long waiting is taking a toll on their plantation. The farmers in the area are taking a keen interest in knowing about the ingenious tree climbing bike developed by Ganapathi and are visiting his house here in Sajeepamuda in Bantwal taluk to inquire about it. Also, videos of Ganapathi climbing the tree on his 'bike' are making rounds on social media and are shared, liked and tweeted. The ingenious bike made by Ganapathi is not only safer but also increases the work output. While it takes 8 minutes for a man to climb up an areca nut tree, bike reduces the time to 30 seconds to 1 minute. As a result, a person can climb more trees to do his job. It is a simple innovation using 2.1 BHP motor (weighing 28kg) with two-stroke gearbox, hydraulic drum disc break and two chains to climb up. However, the climber's weight should be under 80 kilograms. It can make 100 climbs in 1-litre petrol, which saves Rs 4,000 per day. \"This is a long-standing innovation and boon for areca nut farmers. For the last 5 years, at regular intervals, we have seen many types of equipment come and go in the market. But this equipment is better than those as it takes the person to the top of the tree for spraying and plucking purpose and thus is more accurate. These days there is a big shortage of traditional areca-nut tree climbers and this is where equipment plays a role,\" said Rajaram, farmer. \"Whatever efforts the farmers put into cultivating areca-nut, it all goes down in rainy season due to heavy rainfall. This instrument is a benchmark and by using it one can easily climb upto the top of the tree and can easily come down,\" he said. \"Earlier spraying using drones and other equipment was not accurate as the person himself cannot climb the tree,\" said Rajaram. \"Climbing the tree on the machine invented by my dad was a very nice experience. I do not know how to climb but now with the help of this equipment I can easily climb the areca-nut tree and assist my dad in farming,\" said Supriya, daughter of Ganapathi. \"For a man, it takes more than 8 minutes to climb a tree but with the help of this within 30 seconds we can climb a tree and finish 80-90 climb per day,\" she added.

He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts.

The city that was facing a drinking water crisis due to the late onset of monsoon, got relief due to the copious rainfall brought about by the cyclone. However, on the negative side, it further delayed the onset of monsoon on the Karnataka Coast. The district received 137 mm rain in the five days from June 12, which helped overcome the acute drinking water crisis in Mangaluru city and others parts of the district, due to the cyclone. Though the rain was much less in the five days mentioned earlier, as compared to the similar period in 2017 and 2018, which were 182mm and 234 mm, respectively, more importantly, it has resulted in the inflow of water into the Nethravathi river, which was much needed. Mangaluru City Corporation executive engineer Linge Gowda said: \u201cThere is sufficient inflow into the Thumbe Dam at Bantwal. The inflow was nil prior to June 12, and the water level was at 2.1 metres, with dead level storage being 1.3 metres. Now Thumbe Dam is getting 200 to 300 cubic metre per second (cumec) inflow, which is helping the dam get three times the water that is being pumped into the city. This rate of inflow will help the water level in the dam to rise by a metre in 24 hours, whereas good inflow would achieve this in about three hours.\u201d There is further good news, with IMD scientists on Sunday saying that the monsoon has advanced into the southern tip of Mangaluru (Ullal area) and will advance further into other coastal areas within two to three days. As far as rain is concerned, the last 16 days of June has brought about only 198 mm of rain, whereas it was 593mm in 2018 and 421mm in 2017, which is 200% more than what the district has received so far compared to both the years.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Failure to do so will only expose pro-minority chest beating act of the Congress while its leaders continue to loot the minority with impunity, he said. Anwar told reporters that he had red-flagged activities of IMA group that he described as the most fraudulent company that people ever set their eyes up on during the assembly elections in 2018. Noting that the BJP had put him charge of Chamrajpet assembly constituency from where Zameer won, Anwar said he had drawn attention of the government and authorities even then to what he said was apparent fraud that the group was perpetuating. The kind of embezzlement of public funds cannot take place without the active connivance of its promoter Mohammed Mansoor Khan and those in corridors of power, Anwar said, adding even the Reserve Bank of India had successively warned the state government to investigate the group\u2019s activities. The promoter openly used Muslim religious institutions and network to solicit funds for the group and this was happening in the open, Anwar noted. To a claim by Zameer Ahmad that he had received Rs 9.3 crore from Mansoor Khan in a land deal, Anwar said the shifting claims of the minister that it was a donation and then a loan and later a payment for business deal gives rise to lots of suspicion. The purported audio clip in which Mansoor claimed that Shivajinagar MLA Roshan Baig was not returning Rs 400 crore borrowed from him also puts the senior Congress MLA under a cloud, he said. The IMA group scam is in the line of series of frauds perpetuated by the Congress leaders in general and their minority leaders in particular against their own ilk, Manipaddy said. The Amanath Cooperative Bank scam involving former union minister Rahman Khan, the usurping of the Wakf property worth Rs 2.30-lakh crore is all indicative of how these leaders have treated official property as their own personal assets and misused it, Manipaddy added.

The Public Authority of Manpower, Kuwait (PAM) told the Indian embassy that more workers had been trapped similarly in the job fraud and had sought help to return home along with the 72 other workers. Sibi US, second secretary (labour) at the embassy, told TOI over phone that PAM had informed them that the 53 socalled Enasco workers had also been recruited as bike drivers. PAM has asked the embassy to hold talks with them too and ensure their safe return home. Sibi said PAM is likely to take stringent action against the company stakeholders. The labour ministry back home is also helping the Indian embassy to bail out the Indian workers. A source said all the workers had come to Kuwait together but fell apart after a group of 72 youths revolted against the company over non-payment of salary. \u201cThe remaining 53 workers left for another camp and said they would work no matter what. However, even the workers who did not revolt were given just 5 KD (Rs 1,100) per week and have not received their salaries for the past four months,\u201d the source said. The development comes even as the return of the 72 workers has been delayed, possibly by another two weeks, as not all workers have submitted their redressal forms. \u201cAll of them have been asked to complete the procedure online as soon as possible.

As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "NEST 2019 Result": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/exam-results/nest-result-2019-declared-nestexam-in-heres-link-to-check-your-score/articleshow/69842705.cms", "description": ""}, "Movies to watch on New Year's Eve": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/movies-to-watch-on-new-years-eve/photostory/67299074.cms", "description": ""}, "After 8-yr delay, Thokkottu flyover opens": {"time": "2019-06-14 04:20:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/after-8-yr-delay-thokkottu-flyover-opens/articleshow/69778000.cms", "description": "Mangaluru: The much-touted flyover at Thokkottu on NH-66, the completion of which delayed for over eight years, was finally thrown open for the public on Thursday. A part of Talapady-Kundapur four-laning project undertaken by Navayug Udupi Tollway Private Ltd, the flyover projects at Thokkottu and Pumpwell had been the focus of intense political fight between the BJP and Congress due to inordinate delay in its completion. Acknowledging the delay, MP Nalin Kumar Kateel, while inaugurating the flyover, asserted that it was due to technical reasons. \u201cWork on Thokkottu flyover had hit a roadblock since NUTPL incurred financial losses and finally the Union ministry of road transport and highways had to infuse funds in to the cash-strapped company to see the project through,\u201d he said. Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on February 28 had sent Vaibhav Dange, his personal secretary, to look into the problems pertaining to two flyovers that had set off political sparring between BJP and Congress. Axis Bank lent Rs 55 crore to NUTPL, concessionaire of the project, and NHAI provided Rs 7 crore to help finish the work. Acknowledging the intervention of Gadkari to help expedite completion of the two flyovers, Nalin said Gadkari also ensured that legal issues were redressed in time to help NUTPL complete the project. There are a few issues regarding lack of service-roads and difficulty for vehicles proceeding towards Ullal at Thokkottu -end of the flyover, the MP said, adding this will be addressed amicably after discussing it with district minister UT Khader. Incidentally, NUTPL, which bagged the contract for four-laning of the NH stretch from Talapady bordering Kerala up to Kundapur, initially executed the work including bridges at Mulki and Ullal a good speed till it ran into financial difficulties. As per the decision taken at the high-powered meeting on February 28, the work on Thokkottu flyover was supposed to be completed by April 10 and Pumpwell flyover by May 31.

But the lush, green bushes setting off the red tiled-roof structure are not just for aesthetic effect: the jasmine sold in the market pays for the salaries of the honorary teachers. The school hit upon the unique money-spinner some eight years ago when it had no money to pay the two honorary teachers it had hired. Determined that kids\u2019 education shouldn\u2019t suffer, villagers urged the School Development and Monitoring Committee (SDMC) to grow jasmine on the campus to generate revenue. \u201cThe idea was mooted when we hired two honorary teachers to save the school from closure. Villagers and well-wishers suggested we grow jasmine to support hiring of more teachers. It started with 25 jasmine plants and in two years, we added 10 more to the garden,\u201d said Honappa Gowda, president of SDMC and a farmer himself. The school began in 1968 and has about 80 students in classes 1 to 6. It has two permanent government teachers and additional ones it hires. The jasmine plants generate Rs 70,000 to Rs 80,000 a year. The school has smart classes, a borewell and washrooms built by the railways. It also harvests rainwater. Next year, it plans to add kindergarten classes. Honappa recalled eight years ago, teachers and students planted the jasmine and toiled in the garden together. \u201cEven now, children, teachers and other staff together water and nurture the plants,\u201d he said. While teachers and students pluck the flowers, midday meal workers tie them into strands and sell them at Kabaka, about 4km away. In wedding and festive seasons, the flowers sell at high rates. The school has 1.6 acres of land and apart from jasmine, SDMC has planted 35 coconut trees, of which five yield fruits. \u201cThe school has a record of maintaining the highest class attendance,\u201d said Bantwal block education officer N Shivaprakash. \u201cAll SDMC members become workers when it comes to its development.\u201d \u201cThe income from jasmine is not sufficient to fund salaries. Whenever there is a shortage, villagers and parents pool in money,\u201d said Wilma Sequeira, incharge headmistress.
