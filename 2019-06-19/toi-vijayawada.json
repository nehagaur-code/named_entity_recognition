Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

However, Vijayawada has a lesser greenery in comparison with Delhi. The global pollution index publishes its findings on a real-time basis based upon scores given by residents of a particular city. Apart from air quality, residents of Vijayawada gave the city the lowest scores in garbage disposal systems and general comfort. Vijayawada is worse off than Visakhapatnam which achieved a score of 68.01 and was ranked 106th globally. Other two-tier cities which have ranked better than Vijayawada include Pune, Ahmedabad, Dehradun, Madurai, Thane, Nagpur, Vadodara, Coimbatore and Indore.

Stating that farmers\u2019 welfare is the highest priority for the government, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has directed officials to work out modalities and make foolproof arrangements to provide nine hours of free power daily for agriculture sector during day time. According to energy minister B Srinivasa Reddy, power utilities are preparing modalities to begin the prestigious scheme. The state has 18.15 lakh pumpsets and 6,663 agriculture feeders. Of them, 4,951 feeders are ready for the nine-hour scheme. Keeping in view Tuesday\u2019s meeting on the modalities of the nine-hour supply, the minister held a teleconference on Sunday. The state has proposed tariffs at Rs 1.50 a unit for aqua farmers, free power to SC, ST colonies up to 200 units a month, and Rs 12,500 to each farmer towards input cost. He said several states had followed the system introduced by former chief minister YS Rajasekhar Reddy. The scheme had been diluted later. Now, Jaganmohan Reddy wants to strictly implement the free power scheme and stop crop losses due to interruptions in power supply to borewells. The CM will directly contact farmers in future to know the ground reality on the nine-hour power supply\u201d Srinivasa Reddy said. After the review of the power sector on Tuesday, a report will be submitted to the chief minister. Energy secretary and Transco chairman and managing director N Srikant said of the 6,663 agricultural 11 KV feeders in rural areas, only 1,712 feeders require some additional infrastructure to begin the nine-hour power supply during day time. Erection of 16 extra high-tension substations, 32 capacitor banks, 52 power transformers and 112 km of extra high voltage lines 220 KV should be completed to make these feeders ready. These balance 26% agriculture feeders will also be given nine hours supply in two spells (five hours during day time and four hours in night) until they are ready with full infrastructure. When officials informed about the pending loan amount of Rs 3,700 crore approved by the World Bank to improve infrastructure under Power for All scheme, the minister told them the matter would be brought to the notice of the chief minister. B Sreedhar, managing director, APGenco, said it has installed capacity of over 5213 MW.

The agriculture department has already submitted its draft report to the finance department, which has begun preparing the budget. \u201cCM Jagan wanted farmers\u2019 welfare to be the priority of the government. Allocations in the budget will be in line with our CM\u2019s vision,\u201d said minister of animal husbandry, fisheries and marketing Mopidevi Venkata Ramana. According to the initial proposals readied by the agriculture department, about Rs 8,500 crore will be needed to implement the YSR Rythu Bharosa. According to the scheme, the state government has assured to grant Rs 12,500 to each farmer in the state ahead of the Rabi season in October. Sources said that the chief minister has already directed the agriculture department to include tenant farmers under the scheme. Meanwhile, in order to implement the scheme the state government has already scrapped the Chandrababu Naidu government\u2019s Annadata Sukhibhava scheme, which promised to grant Rs 9,000 per year to small and marginal farmers. As per official data, about 60.5 lakh farmers have been identified in the state who own land and there are another 7.5 lakh tenant farmers. Hence, the department has estimated that financial assistance will have to be extended to nearly 68 lakh farmers, for which it will need Rs 8,500 crore. Apart from this the government has promised to pay, on behalf of the farmers, the interest on a loan of Rs 1 lakh. The department has demanded a Rs 4,000 crore for the interest free loans scheme. The state government has also promised to pay the total premium on agriculture insurance from the exchequer. The agriculture department has estimated that it would require another Rs 2,000 crore to pay the premium. Besides agriculture, for the dairy industry, Ramana said, the government has already signed the proposal to increase the milk procurement price by Rs 4 per litre with immediate effect. This scheme would require at least Rs 200 crore for its implementation. \u201cWe are committed to implementing each and every promise made during Jagan\u2019s padayatra and is part of Nava Rathnalu.

He said the building where Naidu has been staying is illegal as it was constructed on a riverbed. Only a few days ago, Naidu wrote to the state government seeking permission to use Praja Vedika, an extension to his residential building, for official purpose to meet party workers. Naidu, as leader of the opposition, enjoys the status of a Cabinet minister. He had sought utilisation of the building complex as part of his official entitlement. While the state government is yet to respond to Naidu\u2019s request, Ramakrishna Reddy, who defeated Naidu\u2019s son and political heir Nara Lokesh in recent assembly elections, told media that Naidu would be evicted from his residence. The government will use all legal process to evict him as the building is an illegal construction in violation of environment norms. The building is owned by an industrialist and the previous state government had hired it for Naidu as official residence. Ramakrishna Reddy had earlier moved high court over the constructions made on the right bank of Krishna River in Guntur district. Reddy alleged that all houses constructed on the river bank including that of Chandrababu Naidu are illegal. He argued in his petition that all these constructions are made in violation of River Conservation Act. Ramakrishna Reddy on Tuesday said the house where Naidu is residing is \u201cdefinitely an illegal construction and our legal fight against all illegal constructions will continue till they are vacated and demolished. We will make Naidu to vacate the illegal construction through legal process,\u201d he said. He also criticised Naidu for staying in illegal construction. Naidu made tall claims over construction of capital Amaravati but he did not even have his own house in Amaravati whereas chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy build his house at Tadepalli, he said. Naidu has been staying in the riverside bungalow for the last four years after the state administration moved to Vijayawada from Hyderabad. The house belonged to a private person but the previous government took it on lease basis for the official residence of chief minister. Later the government constructed \u2018Praja Vedika\u2019, a meeting hall to conduct meetings. TDP MLA Payyavula Keshav said YSRC is resorting to vindictive politics.

But the nightmare was far from being over. \u201cThe boys had followed us till my colleague\u2019s house and, right when we were dropping him at Lake Gardens, six of them on three bikes came and stopped the car. They pelted stones, smashing the window. They then dragged me out and tried to break my phone to delete the video. Luckily, local people heard my cries for help and came out. The boys then fled,\u201d Sengupta recalled.   She then called her father and sister; her own residence was just a lane away. They called cops, who came and asked her to file an FIR at the Charu Market police station. It was 1.30 a.m. when she reached there but, instead of taking down her complaint, the cops there directed her to Bhowanipore police station where the first assault had occured. \u201cI just gave up and started shouting at this point. There was no female police officer. The officer there finally took down my complaint after asking a lot of questions but refused to take the cabby\u2019s complaint, stating that two FIR could not be taken for the same incident,\u201d she said. Frustrated and hapless, she returned home. It was at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday that she posted the entire ordeal on Facebook along with a 20-second video clip. An additional CP later called Sengupta and assured her of strong action against not just the accused but an inquiry into police refusal to take her complaint citing jurisdiction issues. \u201cThe probe has just begun and we have identified all the culprits. More arrests are likely and we will probe whether there was lack of adequate response from cops,\u201d said a Lalbazar official. The arrested were identified as Sheikh Rahit, Fardeen Khan, Sheikh Shabir Ali, Sheikh Gani, Sheikh Imran Ali, Sheikh Wasim and Atif Khan alias Md Samsad. A preliminary inquiry revealed the cab had accidentally brushed against the bike, causing the riders to lose balance. One of the bikes\u2019 rear view mirrors broke and the youths accosted cabby Tarak Debnath to demand compensation. At least two more bikes and an auto carrying more people landed there, leading to the sequence of events ending with the assault at Lake Gardens, officials said.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option. We need to see how this will pan out.\" In Video:Bill seeking to lift green card cap amended to protect US workersDownload The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."}, "clearing of wastage forgotten": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/clearingofwastageforgotten/articleshow/68972971.cms", "description": ""}, "Dangling Danger:Evacuation in arundelpet": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/danglingdanger3aevacuationinarundelpet/articleshow/69420287.cms", "description": ""}, "Bollywood actors who would be great teachers": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/bollywood-actors-who-would-be-great-teachers/photostory/65684334.cms", "description": ""}, "Samsung": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/heres-how-samsung-got-mocked-for-its-social-media-post/articleshow/69835890.cms", "description": ""}, "Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy new TUDA head": {"time": "2019-06-17 22:40:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/bhaskar-reddy-new-tuda-head/articleshow/69817013.cms", "description": "TIRUPATI: Chandragiri YSRC legislator Dr Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy took charge as the chairman of Tirupati urban development authority (TUDA) on Sunday.

As the government is considering to increase liquor prices to make it unaffordable, margin on liquor sales is likely to be increased compensating the corresponding losses in volumes, according to reliable sources in the excise department. The state government is earning nearly Rs 7,000 crore revenue on liquor sales with an average 16 per cent year-on-year growth. There are about 4,402 wine shops and 826 bars across the state which do retail liquor sales. On the other hand, each wine shop is having eight to 10 belt shops which do illegal sales of liquor especially in rural and sub-urban areas. Now with the new government taking the decision to eradicate all belt shops and also to downsize the number of liquor outlets, the sales volumes are likely to get affected. However, this reduction in number of shops may not affect revenues in the first year, said a senior official on condition of anonymity. As the liquor policy is likely to be tweaked every year to downsize the number of outlets to impose complete liquor ban in next five years, revenues will come down from the second year. The increase in liquor prices, however, will give a one-year window for the government to compensate revenue loss and look for alternative sources. On the other hand, many liquor shop owners are also looking to come out of the trade as the state government\u2019s decision is not favourable to them as they expect tighter norms in the upcoming policy. With the reduction of margins in the previous policy, many of them had ended up in losses. Some who are in the trade for long are also not interested this time to participate in the bidding, said Y Srikanth who runs a bar in Vijayawada.

However, it was not to be. The attempts of the RWS to revive the borewells have also gone in vain as water could not be tapped even at the depth of 1,000ft.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

According to the judgement of the consumer forum last year, plastic bags can be sold only if they are not branded. The local municipal body was empowered to implement the order. The body was given the authority to impose fines ranging from Rs 9,000 to Rs 18,000. \u201cRecently, one of the Decathelon showrooms in Hyderabad was fined for selling branded carry bags.

India, as part of ICAO needs to conform to SARPS. BCAS has also laid down categories of persons exempted from security screening and former chief ministers, even with Z category security, have not been exempted. Damodar said it was the late Jayalalithaa, former Tamil Nadu chief minister, who took up the issue with civil aviation authorities and secured exemption after she was subjected to security screening once she stepped down as chief minister.

From Wednesday itself, all personnel from constable to inspector ranks will start getting offs. Director general of police (DGP) Gautam Sawang ordered this after a meeting with the committee constituted to formulate guidelines on weekly offs. This comes in spite of the fact that the police department is facing a severe staff crunch. There is about 20% staff shortage in the department. The committee, headed by additional director general of police Ravishankar Ayyannar, gave its report with 19 alternative plans that will fit various units like intelligence, CID, SPF and greyhounds. The unit heads can choose any plan depending upon their convenience, said Ayyannar. While some states have earlier tried to implement weekly offs, they have been limited to pilot projects only. With implementation of weekly offs, cumulative staff crunch in the department will be 30 per cent as one-seventh of the staff will be off duties. Ayyannar went on to say that an IT dashboard will be created to monitor the weekly offs in all districts and special units from the DGP\u2019s office. The system will be reviewed after a month to deal with the problems that arise in implementation. Police officers\u2019 associations across the state welcomed the decision. Srinivasa Rao, president of Andhra Pradesh police officers\u2019 association thanked chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy and the DGP for implementing the weekly offs. He said that they have been waiting for this for two decades. Jaganmohan Reddy had made weekly offs to police personnel a part of his election promises.

According to the victims, the leopard attacked both the vehicles simultaneously when they fell. Following the fall, the leopard attempted to drag the girls away. In a bid to save their daughters, the fathers tried to scare off the wild cat. One of the fathers found a log and somehow managed to scare the leopard away. The girls sustained minor injuries on their legs and were rushed to Ashwini Hospital at Tirumala for treatment. The girls have been placed under observation for 24 hours. Locals and devotees in the area are scared out of their wits following the midnight leopard attack. Some locals said that forest department officials of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) have done little to prevent leopard attacks. \u201cEven though a leopard was spotted near Mokalla Mettu on May 8, which is close to where the incident occurred on Sunday, the forest department has done nothing to capture the wild cat,\u201d said a resident of Tirumala on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, the forest department has not been able to confirm whether the leopard who attacked the goals was the same as the one spotted near Mokkala Mettu earlier. Instead of initiating measures, the forest officials are advising locals against venturing into the twin ghat roads in two-wheelers, especially at night.

The House appealed to the NDA government at the Centre to grant SCS to the state at the earliest to overcome the financial crisis following its bifurcation. Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy moved the resolution, giving some background on the bifurcation of the state, distribution of assets and liabilities, and the promises made to the state by the Parliament as a precondition to the bifurcation and the constitutional binding of the government to fulfil the bifurcation promises, including the SCS. He sought to blame the previous TDP government for not pursuing the issue in 2014, till the Planning Commission was replaced with Niti Aayog. \u201cThe SCS promise was made to the state on the floor of Rajya Sabha and the same was ratified by the cabinet, which was again sent to the Planning Commission for implementation. However, the TDP government, instead of asking the Planning Commission to implement it, asked the central government, which brought the issue back to the table of the Union council of ministers,\u201d the CM said. Jagan further said that the bifurcation was unjust, as distribution of assets and liabilities was not done in proportion. He also emphasised on the need to develop the state, which can be achieved if it gets SCS. \u201cThe grant of special category status will help the state get special industrial incentives such as income tax exemption, exemptions pertaining to GST, besides other concessions. The assembly reiterates that such special incentives are vital for our agrarian state, as it would enable rapid industrialisation, which would lead to improved employment opportunities for the youth and overall development of the state,\u201d the resolution stated, adding that \u201cthe assembly expresses its firm opinion that there are no impediments whatsoever to conferring SCS on Andhra Pradesh\u201d.
