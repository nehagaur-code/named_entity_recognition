Mohammed Mahabub Hussain, 30, who was on his way to Hyderabad after attending court proceedings, was chased by hired killers and killed in front of horrified commuters on May 31. Patancheru police said among the arrested were head of the assassin gang, Khaleel, and seven gang members. Khaleel reportedly got a country-made pistol from Kalaburagi in Karnataka, which he brandished to threaten onlookers while Hussain was repeatedly attacked with a sickle. Police said Hussain was eliminated in revenge for the murder of Mohammad Arshad Hussain of Cherlapally in 2018 in which the former was the prime accused. Hussain, a resident of Bholakpur in Musheerabad, was intercepted by the killers at Rudraram, 50 km away from the city, and killed. The killers repeatedly attacked Hussain on his head with brute force with the sickle even after he died. Police said family members of Arshad struck a deal with the assassin gang for Rs 6 lakh to get rid of Hussain. \u201cWe have also arrested three brothers of Arshad. The trio along with their father conspired to kill Hussain and hired the killer gang from Kalaburagi,\u201d said DSP, Patancheru, R Rajeshwar Rao. The siblings\u2014Mohammed Asif, Akhil and Ansari\u2014were picked up from their Cherlapally home, while the gang members were picked up from a lodge in Panjagutta.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

He said the building where Naidu has been staying is illegal as it was constructed on a riverbed. Only a few days ago, Naidu wrote to the state government seeking permission to use Praja Vedika, an extension to his residential building, for official purpose to meet party workers. Naidu, as leader of the opposition, enjoys the status of a Cabinet minister. He had sought utilisation of the building complex as part of his official entitlement. While the state government is yet to respond to Naidu\u2019s request, Ramakrishna Reddy, who defeated Naidu\u2019s son and political heir Nara Lokesh in recent assembly elections, told media that Naidu would be evicted from his residence. The government will use all legal process to evict him as the building is an illegal construction in violation of environment norms. The building is owned by an industrialist and the previous state government had hired it for Naidu as official residence. Ramakrishna Reddy had earlier moved high court over the constructions made on the right bank of Krishna River in Guntur district. Reddy alleged that all houses constructed on the river bank including that of Chandrababu Naidu are illegal. He argued in his petition that all these constructions are made in violation of River Conservation Act. Ramakrishna Reddy on Tuesday said the house where Naidu is residing is \u201cdefinitely an illegal construction and our legal fight against all illegal constructions will continue till they are vacated and demolished. We will make Naidu to vacate the illegal construction through legal process,\u201d he said. He also criticised Naidu for staying in illegal construction. Naidu made tall claims over construction of capital Amaravati but he did not even have his own house in Amaravati whereas chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy build his house at Tadepalli, he said. Naidu has been staying in the riverside bungalow for the last four years after the state administration moved to Vijayawada from Hyderabad. The house belonged to a private person but the previous government took it on lease basis for the official residence of chief minister. Later the government constructed \u2018Praja Vedika\u2019, a meeting hall to conduct meetings. TDP MLA Payyavula Keshav said YSRC is resorting to vindictive politics. On one hand, the chief minister says they will not do any vindictive politics but their MLAs come up with statements like this. When the issue is in court, and if the court give any order everyone will have honour the orders. There is no necessity for such statements while the issue is in court, he said.

If law is what must be enforced, she does so with an iron hand, as that is what her work is all about but Chandana Deepti, is using her writing skills and poetry to influence people\u2019s thinking and wean them away from crime. Of late, it is this poetry of Medak Superintendent of Police (SP) Chandana Deepti that is touching a strong chord with the general public and especially people of the district. Chandana Deepti is an IIT Delhi graduate in CSE and is a 2012-batch IPS officer and has served in various districts in Telangana before her posting as Medak SP. Born in Warangal and brought up in Hyderabad, Chadana Deepti has made herself more accessible to people of the district on various social media platforms. A few days ago, she encouraged people to bring to her notice problems and issues pertaining to law and order and many responded with questions to her with the hashtag #AskMedakSP on Facebook. It, however, is her poetry in Telugu, lately that is giving wings to her thoughts. What is love? That is a big question. But Chandana has an answer. \u201cLove isn\u2019t what dangles and flutters on your whatsapp screen. Love is not going about on a drive in the car and getting some hush-hush talk to do the rounds. Love is not kissing one another right in the middle of the road,\u201d Chandana Deepti said in one of her poems. Through her poetry, the Medak SP was obviously addressing the issue of love stories going awry and crimes being committed. \u201cPure love is found in the mother\u2019s eyes when she looks at her new born,\u201d Chandana Deepti concluded in her poem. In another post, the SP also had a piece of advice for elders. \u201cDon\u2019t ask a youth what he is doing. Ask him what he or she can do,\u201d she advised so that it could spur them to think about their own abilities. The selling of fake seeds to farmers by unscrupulous traders has been an issue but while warning against resorting to such malpractices, Chandana Deepti appealed to their emotions on why they should not deceive farmers through her writings. In another post, quoting crime statistics, Chandana Deepti said 26 per cent of prisoners were those who had committed a crime on the spur of the moment, giving no thought to what their action would result it. \u201cThat act in anger could result in the death of a person. A family being shattered. And result in a slur on the society. The one who commits the crime has to spend his or her life within the four walls of the jail because of the crime committed in a gush of anger,\u201d she said underscoring the importance of not being provoked to anger or overtaken by extreme emotion. She gives a solution for such situation: Smile and move on. With the monsoon delayed in Telangana and heat wave conditions prevailing, Chandana Deepti put out a message that there was no point in blaming nature. She advised people to plant saplings. But waiting for the rain a 11-line poem in Telugu that has become a hit with those who follow her writings. There is a craving in the poet for the rain as the rain is what farmers look forward to. The rain, she points out is what children took look forward to eagerly. \u201cNela pulakarinchipoyi chirunavvulu chindisthunte choodalani undhi,\u201d reads the last line of a poem on the rain expressing the desire to see the earth smile when it rains. The SP also talks about riches and the wealth that one inherits in one of her writings. \u201cBut it is not those riches. Our traditions and our culture are the most invaluable things that we have inherited,\u201d she said.

This is what gives me satisfaction,\u201d the young man said, sharing bits from his time as a volunteer, thus far. \u201cThere was a 70-year-old man whom I used to regularly ferry. Then, one day, he met with an accident and I happened to be around. Timely intervention saved his life. The contentment that it gave me, was beyond words,\u201d Narsimha said. \u201cIt\u2019s the joy on his face that also wiped away all the doubt that my mother had about my decision to become a volunteer and tend to victims of accidents,\u201d he added. It\u2019s for the same reason that 33-year-old Krisha has decided to continue doing this work for as long as he is able to. \u201cApart from satisfaction, it also brings some recognition... It\u2019s a good feeling,\u201d the auto driver from Shamirpet said. Though unlike most others, Muzeeb (32), was a little scared about taking on the new \u2018role\u2019 initially, he has now eased into it. \u201cI decided to become a volunteer because I want to help people. But I was scared because I feared getting tangled in police cases. Now, that I have learned about the Good Samaritan Law that protects people who try to help others, I go about by work without any hesitation,\u201d he said. Touting the venture as a first-of-its-kind project in the country, Dr G V Ramana Rao, director, National Emergency Medicine Learning and Care Research, who is also the project director told TOI, \u201cThere is a WhatsApp group of auto-rickshaw drivers who have been trained to be volunteers.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. He defeated Congress's Ramnaraian Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently concluded general election. He has also been elected to Rajasthan assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. Birla will succeed eight-term MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this will not be for the first time a relative newcomer will hold the position. In 1996, TDP leader G M C Balayogi was also a two-time MP when he was elected as the LS Speaker and after his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and the first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

As villagers have been closely guarding their livestock after the big cat killed more than 20 calves in the last five months, the leopard, which had been prowling the area, has started going for dogs. A forest official said that leopards killing dogs is a regular practice and in this case, about six dogs have gone missing from villages of Yacharam in the past few months. \u201cWhen a leopard does not get its natural prey, it moves towards populated area in search of small and easy prey, like dogs.

Earlier, the AP high court had quashed the case against senior IAS officer and current AP chief secretary LV Subrahmanyam though CBI had made him an accused in its case. The ED never named him in its case. HC said that LV was not a party to the alleged conspiracy hatched to plunder the public assets. Though CBI\u2019s case on Koneru Madhu, too, was quashed by the HC, ED did not take that into consideration. It made Madhu an accused in its chargesheet. This is because PMLA tracks the proceeds of the crime and hence made him an accused, it is said. KV Rao and Boulder Hills, too, were not named as accused in the ED chargesheet, though their names figured in the CBI case. Another senior IAS officer, BP Acharya\u2019s name, too, was not there because the cases filed by CBI and ED were already quashed by the high court.

Cops from Bhowanipore arrived around 10-15 minutes later.

From Wednesday itself, all personnel from constable to inspector ranks will start getting offs. Director general of police (DGP) Gautam Sawang ordered this after a meeting with the committee constituted to formulate guidelines on weekly offs. This comes in spite of the fact that the police department is facing a severe staff crunch. There is about 20% staff shortage in the department. The committee, headed by additional director general of police Ravishankar Ayyannar, gave its report with 19 alternative plans that will fit various units like intelligence, CID, SPF and greyhounds. The unit heads can choose any plan depending upon their convenience, said Ayyannar. While some states have earlier tried to implement weekly offs, they have been limited to pilot projects only. With implementation of weekly offs, cumulative staff crunch in the department will be 30 per cent as one-seventh of the staff will be off duties. Ayyannar went on to say that an IT dashboard will be created to monitor the weekly offs in all districts and special units from the DGP\u2019s office. The system will be reviewed after a month to deal with the problems that arise in implementation. Police officers\u2019 associations across the state welcomed the decision. Srinivasa Rao, president of Andhra Pradesh police officers\u2019 association thanked chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy and the DGP for implementing the weekly offs.

Recent satellite images seem to indicate so. Interestingly, forest officials have found that not only Adivasis, even non-tribals are encroaching upon the forest land. They squarely blamed the people of Gond and Kolam tribes for the indiscriminate cutting of trees. Kagaznagar forest divisional officer Raja Ramana Reddy told TOI that several areas (compartments) had been cleared of green cover in the Garlapet reserved forest in Kagaznagar section between 2010 and 2018. \u201cSatellite mapping has clearly revealed this. Apart from Adivasis, non-tribals are also resorting to large-scale encroachments. Gonds and Kolams are chopping trees,\u201d he said. Forest officials said 6.4 lakh acres of forest land is disputed and several court cases are pending. Senior officials said the forest area in united Khammam, Adilabad and Warangal districts is worst-affected where land in huge tracts is encroached upon. Ramana said Kolams belonging to Wankidi mandal in Kumaram Bheem-Asifabad district had encroached forest land in 70 acres after making incursions 30 km into the forest. \u201cWe had served notices to them in February. When we issued eviction notices, they approached the high court, which asked us to follow the due process of law,\u201d he explained. The tribals were given time till May 15. \u201cHowever, they moved the court again. We explained the ground situation to the court,\u201d Ramana said. The forest officials are also wary about rise in attacks on them. When some forest officials tried to stop encroachment in 460 compartments of Manchippa reserve forest in Gandhari range on May 29, villagers attacked them. Forest section officer Venkata Swamy was injured when the encroachers rammed a tractor into him. In fact, attempts by senior forest officials to stop fresh felling have led to friction between the department and Adivasis. Eviction of Kolam tribals on June 12 was taken kindly by tribals and non-tribals in Asifabad district. In September 2017, eviction of Gothikoyas from forest land by the officials in Jayashankar Bhupalpally district had led to an outrage all across the state.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option.

He sought blessings from his supporters for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and asserted that the NDA government has left no stone unturned to bring about development in the state.

There is no dearth of funds when it comes to development work in the country. \"In the last five years, the government has been able to build homes for eight lakh families, light up 3,000 houses and provide gas connections to 40 lakh homes,\" Modi stated. Referring to Mission Shakti, when India demonstrated anti-satellite (ASAT) missile capability by shooting down a live satellite, he said the government has taken measures to set up a 'chowkidar' (watchman) in space. He came down heavily on opposition parties who he said \"belittled\" the space achievement. \"Those that are criticising the anti-satellite technology will be given a befitting reply in the elections,\" he claimed, urging people to vote for a government that can take concrete decisions, not the one that only raises slogans.

The amalgam that apposed diametrically divergent and distinguishing styles was enthralling, to say the least.  the group started with Vande Mataram fused with Sare Jahan Se Achha, keeping in mind the Independene Day fervour. Sahaj Ma\u2019s deep voice and Godkhindi\u2019s classical vistar resounded in the auditorium. A peek into each performer\u2019s individual streams left listeners spellbound.

The jugalbandi between Pt.Shubhankar Banerjee on tabla and Gino Banks on drums left the audience craving for more. Pravin Godkhindi, who is the only Indian to play the world\u2019s largest flute, the contrabass, captivated the audience with his euphonious flute renditions. Sahaj Ma and Utpal Faqir transported the audience to rural Bengal with the song, Chander gaye chaand legeche, amra jene korbo ki, by a Bengali Baul saint, Lalon Fakir.  The musicians followed each other on stage, improvising to suit each other\u2019s style, yet, not letting their individualistic style get lost in the blend. As the musicians traversed through intricate patterns to attain a crescendo, the auditorium thundered with undying applause.

Addressing a meeting in Guntur on Monday, Pawan said that the future of the state did not mean the future of Lokesh and Jagan but it was the future of the people. \u201cThe space on the state\u2019s political stage is not TDP\u2019s and YSRC\u2019s property as youth and women are eager to bring change through Jana Sena.\u201d \u201cTDP had lost moral right to rule the state as chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had no control over his legislators who indulged in illegal activities,\u201d Pawan said adding that he jumped into the political arena to bring in a change in the lives of commoners. \u201cWe supported TDP and BJP in the last elections with a hope to transform the state. Unfortunately, both of them have shattered our dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cGuntur city has been left in a lurch despite located a few kilometres away from the capital city. The entire city has been dug out in the guise of laying underground drainage scheme and left without repair. How shocking it is to see 30 people dying of diarrhoea in a city like Guntur? Is it not the failure of the state government? Opposition leader Jaganmohan Reddy is equally responsible for the tragedy as he never dared to question the government by going to the assembly,\u201d he said. He further said they would construct apartments exclusively for Muslims in the city. He appealed to people to support his candidates Chandrasekhar (Guntur West), Zia-Ur-Rehman (East) and MP candidate Bonaboina Srinivas Yadav in the elections, Pawan said they fielded a BC candidate Srinivasa Yadav whereas TDP and YSRC both have given tickets to their own communities.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

This includes a few items from the \u2018fabulous\u2019 treasure house of the Nizam. So famous was his collection, that the last ruler of Hyderabad was also known as \u2018The Fabulous Mughal\u2019. The auction is set to take place on June 19 in New York. While a collection of 173 pieces of jewellery of the Nizams, now owned by the government of India, are put on display once in a while in the country, there are said to be hundreds of other jewels in possession of either family members or have been sold to collectors, connoisseurs and businessmen across the world. \u201cWhat is left in Hyderabad is not even a fraction of the legendary collection of the last Nizam,\u201d a family member rued. A diamond and enamelled gold bowl estimated worth Rs 3.48 crore, ceremonial sword estimated worth Rs 10.44 crore, scabbard and sword estimated worth Rs 8.34 croreIt is not known how many of the 400 pieces that would be put under the hammer are from formerly princely Hyderabad State. However, officials at Christie\u2019s, mention a few. This collection is owned by the cousin of the ruler of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani. His interest in jewels began in 2009, and today he is said to own some 6,000 pieces from across the world. At the New York show, for instance, there will be a 19th century bib-like diamond and emerald necklace. Experts believe this itself will leave buyers and onlookers spellbound. Then there will be a rivi\u00e8re necklace, which features almost 200 carats of diamonds from the Golconda mines, the earliest group of mines known to man. Located in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, at one time they were the only cluster where diamonds were found. There is also The Mirror of Paradise. This is a 52.58 carat, rectangular-cut diamond that was last sold at auction in 2013 for $10.9million. But for one daughter, all the children of the last Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan have passed away. The third generation of Nawab of Deccan is scattered and in disarray. However, there are a few members of the erstwhile royal family, who are in the know of things. Even among them, they are those who are tight-lipped on how the jewels might have found their way to the international auction house. Many point to one incident soon after the death of Nizam in February 1967. They say some of the members of the royal family, in cahoots with powerful politicians of the day, smuggled out the jewels. There is at least one member of the family who says he met Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani in Delhi during the Nizams jewellery exhibition recently. However, Najaf Ali Khan, grandson of the Nizam, says he has not met or dealt with the collector any time earlier.

The last such occurrence when the monsoon hit the region when it was part of the united Andhra Pradesh after June 27 was in the year 1972 \u2014 47 years ago. In 2018, monsoon hit Telangana on June 4 bringing an early cheer on the faces of farmers. According to weathermen, monsoon usually hits the state between June 7-10. But, this time round, the likelihood of monsoon rains delaying beyond June 27 is also not being ruled out. In 1972, Kerala experienced the first southwest monsoon rains on June 17, a delay of 17 days from its normal onset date of June 1. The unified Andhra Pradesh received monsoon rains 10 days later \u2014 June 27. This was 47 years ago. Going by the delay in the system moving north-north centralwards, it could derail the monsoon\u2019s ascent and its arrival could be delayed further beyond June 27, officials explained. Senior officials recall that monsoon was delayed five years ago in Telangana despite hitting Kerala on June 6. \u201cThere was a delay of 14 days in the monsoon reaching Telangana because of various factors and the trajectory of the monsoon that year. This year, monsoon struck Kerala on June 8. By the time it makes its way into Telangana, it could be beyond June 25-27,\u201d an official reasoned. \u201cThis year, it is going to be a slow and sluggish start due to various reasons. Two key factors are the speed of the westerlies and long-wave radiation,\u201d officials said.

He also reminded everyone that he had called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a \u2018fascist\u2019 in 2014. The CM, who skipped the Niti Aayog meeting in Delhi headed by Modi three days ago, said the Aayog had recommended Rs 24,000 crore financial assistance to the state for two flagship water schemes \u2013 Mission Bhagiratha and Mission Kakatiya. \u201cBut, the Centre did not give us even Rs 24,\u201d KCR told reporters at his first cabinet meeting after the Lok Sabha elections. The meeting lasted a good six hours. The CM said that as per the AP Reorganisation Act, Telangana should have received Rs 450 crore per year as assistance to develop backward districts. But, it got the grant for only four years and not five, he said. \u201cWhen BJP national president Amit Shah claimed that several lakhs in financial assistance was given to Telangana, I exposed it as a bundle of lies and demanded his apology for spreading lies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe TRS government had given issue-based support to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-1 on demonetisation, election for the President and GST. But I recall, I had called Modi a \u2018fascist prime minister\u2019 after seven mandals from Telangana and Sileru project were transferred to Andhra Pradesh in 2014,\u201d KCR said at a press conference after the cabinet meeting. Both KCR and Modi had good relations till the assembly elections in Telangana in Dec 2018. The TRS chief took a more strident approach towards BJP and Modi during campaigning, even attacking the PM over Hindutva politics. During the Lok Sabha elections, a large number of turmeric farmers from Telangana had gone to Varanasi to file nomination papers and contest against Modi. Although their nominations were rejected, BJP leaders alleged that the farmers were sent by TRS. Responding to a query whether he would invite the PM for the inauguration of Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project on June 21, KCR said: \u201cI invited him for inauguration of Mission Bhagiratha (a scheme aimed at supplying piped water to every household) four years ago. There is no need to invite him for every programme. I am the achiever of Kaleshwaram project,\u201d the CM said. He said he was also not attending the all-party meeting called by the Prime Minister in Delhi on June 19 as he was busy with the launch of Kaleshwaram project on June 21. TRS working president KT Rama Rao would take part in the meeting. He criticised Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy for his remarks that Hyderabad has become a den for terrorists. \u201cIt is a joke. There were no communal riots or clashes in the last five years when compared to communal incidents in Hyderabad when it was part of united Andhra Pradesh. People in a responsible position should talk with some meaning,\u201d he said.

The embassy informed initially that she had been provided with an emergency passport but her request for a ticket was under process as she had \u2018failed to provide necessary details about her agents\u2019. The desperation of the woman to go back to Nellore to her two daughters and son was made known to the embassy by Srinivas who explained her difficult circumstances. On Tuesday evening, the Indian Embassy said that a ticket on the first available flight was being arranged by the Mission for the woman to be sent back to India. Srinivas urged external affairs minister S Jaishankar to give blanket orders to embassies to help Indian housemaids stuck in the gulf to be sent home without any delays. In this case, the woman had reportedly been approaching the embassy for the last two years as she wanted to be sent back to India. The woman said she had been taken to Bahrain six years ago to work as a housemaid but was exploited. She was made to work for 13 families in a four-floor building wherein she had to do all the household work. She was also not paid. When she approached the agent and said she could not work there anyone, she was reportedly used as a sex slave. The woman was literally forced to entertain customers for two months, despite her protests.

The enhanced operator and cab amenities include the provision of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning along with the hot plate, heated windshields and display screens for the loco pilot\u2019s convenience. Officials informed that the consolidated control architecture system has also been provided with features such as trip optimiser, loco-vision and cab signalling. The auto engine start/stop is integrated with the auxiliary power unit giving a quality boost to the maintenance of the loco. Remote monitoring and diagnostics have also been enabled for continuous fleet health monitoring. In a statement released by SCR, it has been mentioned that the safety standards of the loco are enhanced by cab frontal collision system designed to withstand tough crashes. Packaging of electrical hardware and equipment has been done to enable easy maintenance. The lightweight bogie frame also needs minimal maintenance. This new breed of WDG-6G Diesel Locomotives is set to play a significant role in the plans of Indian Railways, with the carrying capacity of a freight train rake to significantly increase on account of the hauling strength of the locomotive.

Driver Satish and his accomplice Rahul were arrested on Monday and Rs 5 lakh and 25 tola gold seized from them. The murder came to light after the couple\u2019s four US-based children didn\u2019t receive any calls for several days and they alerted family members in the city who then approached cops. Reddy owned about 40 acres in Patancheru and over 55 acres in Humnabad (Bidar). He had been travelling frequently between Hyderabad and Humnabad to his rented place to oversee the development of his land. On the night of June 12 too Reddy and his wife had started from their home at BHEL in their Innova with driver Satish. The couple slept during the journey. \u201cAround 1am, when the car crossed Mannaekhelli toll plaza before Humnabad, Satish took a detour. He got off the main road and drove for about 100 metres to an isolated area where his friend Rahul was waiting. Reddy woke up when Satish stopped the car and got out of the vehicle. Both Satish and Rahul attacked him with an iron rod. By then, his wife had woken up and the duo attacked her too.

The state\u2019s municipal administration department\u2019s principal secretary Arvind Kumar conveyed this request to the high court on Tuesday through an affidavit filed in three separate petitions filed by the state election commission, Jajula Srinivas Goud of Telangana BCs Association and Ganeshachary, all of whom have either charged the state with dodging the issue or with not following the due pre-poll procedure. Filing a common reply to all the three pleas, the municipal administration chief said that though they are under an obligation to complete the polls before the end of the tenure of the current regimes in municipalities under Article 243 (U) (3) of the Constitution, they are unable to do so because of the creation of the new municipalities that emerged after merging them with several adjoining villages. Justice P Naveen Rao who heard the pleas, earlier sought to know from the state whether it is thinking in terms of appointing persons in charge to the municipalities after the term of the existing bodies is getting over in the next two weeks. The state is likely to appoint persons in charge from July 3, as the state itself is seeking five more months time now, an official source said. It is not clear whether the new person in charge is a bureaucrat or not, the source said. The State of Telangana has constituted 68 new municipalities by upgrading 173-gram panchayats and merging another 131-gram panchayat into adjoining 42 municipalities and municipal corporations, Arvind Kumar said in his affidavit. There was litigation against these mergers and that was cleared only on March 8, 2019, he said. For the purpose of determining new wards, we are working out a new method wherein the old method of giving priority to the grade of the municipality was done away with and we are now giving priority to the population, the principal secretary said. This requires consultation with the public and later there would be a door to door survey for determining reservation of wards for SC, ST and BC categories of people, he said. He also spoke about the BC population survey which they will take up soon not only in the current 53 municipalities and 3 municipal corporations alone but also in GHMC, Khammam, Greater Warangal, Siddipet and Achampet municipal corporations also though their elected terms will expire only in 2021, he said.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

Private facilities, too, largely remained out of bounds (except for emergency services). As a result, hundreds of patients had to return without treatment. While many others stood in queues for hours together, patients with medical emergency, too, had to wait for one to two hours amid the chaos. Sanjeev Singh Yadav, state secretary of Indian Medical Association, said, \u201cParticipation from private and corporate sector hospitals in the strike, including small-time clinics, was almost absolute on Monday.\u201d In addition to strike over assaults on doctors, junior doctors are protesting against the state government\u2019s decision to increase retirement age of faculty. At many places, there were delays in arranging stretchers and taking patients inside the hospitals. Among them was 40-year-old Mahender, a paralysis patient who was made to wait at the entrance of Gandhi Hospital in the out-patient ward for almost an hour as there wasn\u2019t enough staff or doctors to attend to him. The patient, a migrant worker from Nalgonda, was seen lying helpless in the hospital premises till the staff arrived an hour later. There were others who had already been turned away by one or two other hospitals. A paralysis patient, Mallesh K, who was turned away from the area hospital in Malakpet and government Unani hospital at Charminar, reached OGH on Monday morning complaining of giddiness and extreme discomfort. Suresh K, who accompanied his mother, and father Mallesh from Nalgonda, said: \u201cWe came to Hyderabad three days ago and after visiting two hospitals, we were redirected here. We have been going from room-to-room from morning, but there is no clarity on what to do. My father cannot be admitted as there are no doctors.\u201d Patients who had travelled to the city from far off locations such as Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda, Warangal and other states, too, were left in the lurch as they were unaware of the strike and had already been given Monday\u2019s date for consultation. Several patients and their attendants were seen crying as they went without food or water in the queues. At several places in the hospitals, volunteers of Helping Hand Foundation were seen outside OPDs, counselling patients and their attendants to come back on Tuesday for consultation.

The cabinet also gave powers to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to take a final call on the construction of the new secretariat and assembly. \u201cWhile the new secretariat will be built at the existing secretariat complex at a cost of Rs 400 crore with around six lakh square ft built-up area, the new assembly will be constructed at Irrum Manzil in 17 acres, which is set to cost Rs 100 crore. Foundation stone for the new secretariat will be laid on June 27,\u201d chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao told mediapersos after the cabinet meeting. The chief minister said the new assembly would resemble parliament with a central hall, council hall and other facilities and the front elevation of the assembly would look like the front elevation of the present assembly building.

If both assured and flood waters is taken into consideration, the water quantity will touch 5,000 tmcft which needs to be utilised effectively by both the states.
