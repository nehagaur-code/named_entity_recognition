The 4.8 lakh population in the existing 48 wards of the Avadi municipality have become part of corporation. \u201cConsidering the increase in population, growth in annual income and the level of the civic services to be provided towards fulfilment of the basic needs of the growing population\u2026 the government has decided to upgrade the municipality into corporation,\u201d said a statement issued by law department. The government took the ordinance route as the assembly was not in session. An Avadi resident, T Sadagopan, said: \u201cPiped water supply and underground drainage system are the two major issues which were not fulfilled by the administrators in the last two and half decades. Now with the upgradation we hope both these issues will be sorted out.\u201d As far as Kamarajar Nagar is concerned, garbage collection is a major issue, said Krishnamurthy, a resident of the area. \u201cWith the upgradation of the municipality, we are hopeful that a proper garbage collection system will be put in place,\u201d he said. Governor Banwarilal Purohit had signed the order on March 9, on the eve of the election commission notifying the general elections. The commission did not give permission to notify the announcement, sources said. The government originally proposed to include Thiruverkadu municipality and Thirunindravur town panchayat and 10 village panchayats, such as Kattupakkam and Ayapakkam, but stuck to Avadi municipality alone, given the ongoing delimitation of wards for the upcoming local body polls, said Minister K Pandiarajan who represents Avadi in the assembly. Including more areas would have delayed the local body polls, he added. \u201cThere is a complete transformation of Avadi from a sleepy little bunch of eight villages 20 years ago to a modern corporation. That was largely because of industrial investments,\u201d Pandiarajan told TOI. The state government is planning a third TIDEL park at Pattabiram in Avadi, which is to come up in 18 months at a cost of Rs300crore. Chief minister E K Palaniswami will also inaugurate an eco-park at Paruthipattu lake in Avadi on the lines of theeco-park at Chetpet.

When questioned about this at a press meet on Tuesday, school education minister K A Sengottaiyan said providing water to students is the responsibility of the school managements and some are even collecting fees to call water tankers. \u201cThere is not much for the government to comment on it. There is no acute shortage in any of the government-funded school across Tamil Nadu,\u201d he said.

While most private establishments are on the verge of completing admissions, the government committee formed to conduct Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) 2019 has postponed counselling. The rank list, which was to be released on Monday, will be released today, i.e. June 20 and counselling for special category candidates \u2014 people with disabilities and eminent sports persons \u2014 will begin on June 25, according to an official release. READ ALSO: TNEA 2019 Rank List to be out shortly @ tneaonline.in\u201cEvery day of delay is advantageous to deemed universities and top private colleges. Students, with a cut-off (minimum eligibility score) of 180 and above are uncertain of getting admissions in sought-after colleges through counselling. They are confused whether to join private institutions or wait for the counselling to begin,\u201d said education consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi. Corroborating this, deemed universities, in their official press releases, claim to have witnessed a spike in applicants and cut-off scores based on which admission is carried out alongside entrance tests. This could be an indicator that toppers who could have secured admission through counselling may have joined deemed universities due to the delay. As far as top private engineering colleges affiliated to Anna University are concerned, there has been an increase in demand for integrated courses like MSc Data Sciences, business analytics and artificial intelligence, Gandhi added. Deadline to pay fees for these courses (under management quota) is nearing and some have opted for these courses, reducing the chance of more toppers joining Anna University colleges further, say experts. The counselling was already set to begin with 40,000 vacant seats as only 1.3 lakh applied for 1.7 lakh seats available. A senior official from Anna University said not conducting counselling as announced will make people lose trust and turn them towards institutions which have better infrastructure and placement record than affiliated colleges. \u201cAfter vice-chancellor M K Surappa withdrew, the committee hasn\u2019t utilised Anna University\u2019s resources and they are feeling the heat now. The inexperience is reflecting in the form of delays,\u201d the official added. When asked about the delay, the committee attributed it to it giving another chance for applicants who didn\u2019t get their certificates verified properly and said it will not affect the admission process. Parents have requested for engineering counselling to begin on second or third day of medical counselling as cut-off scores of state board students are not high and the impact on medical admission is now mellowed down by NEET.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

Shops across Anderson Street and NSC Bose Road in busy Parry\u2019s corner were raided by officials and 505kg of plastic was seized from there. Corporation sources cited the lack of police support in carrying out raids. \u201cWe have to carry out surprise raids and we face harassment from traders who threaten and attack. The same happened on Tuesday. We have noticed in the past, if we seek police protection, traders get prior information about raids and, thus, leave their stores locked. There is no support from police, whatsoever,\u201d said an official. Sources in the civic body also said that no shops were sealed as offenders can be caught three times and pay up a penalty. \u201cIf they are caught for the fourth time, their trade license will be revoked,\u201d said an official. \u201cWe have issued notices to many first-time offenders and penalized others.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Music and history enthusiasts are bringing them into the public imagination through training, workshops and exhibitions. Official at the Shiva temples, the original patrons, too are doing their part by including the forgotten instruments in their festivities. At a recent exhibition of traditional music instruments at the Government Museum in Coimbatore visitors not only could see the instruments, but also listen to them. Instruments such as \u2018kombu\u2019 (brass pipe) and \u2018pambai\u2019 (small drum) were played by heritage enthusiast Ananda Kumar for an enraptured audience. A handful of musicians trained in playing these instruments and a broken practice of having the full orchestra at play in temples, make it challenging for the instruments to get back into the groove. Kumar says there is an increased interest in the instruments, but it\u2019s the temples using them again in rituals that is a heartening trend. \"Recently, several Shiva temples have roped-in players of traditional instruments known as Kailaaya Vaadhiyam (instruments of Kailash) for ritual services,\" he says. An official at the ancient Patteeswarar Temple in Perur in Coimbatore, admitted that though playing of Kailaaya Vaadhiyam was discontinued, they started the practice again. \"The temple has no permanent players for the instrument. So we call trained players from the Perur Adheenam mutt,\" says the official. The mutt has been training people in playing Kailaaya Vaadhiyam instruments. Representatives say their sessions are sought after by youngsters, working professionals as well as elderly people with an ear for music. \"We have 10-year-olds to 50-year-olds. Even some MBA holders have learned to play,\" says Kuruntham Manivasaga Adigal, 44, who plays and teaches some of the old instruments. Adigal says at least 10 groups in Coimbatore play the instruments in Shiva temple rituals. \"Earlier, during the \u2018Appar Kailaaya Kaatchi\u2019 ritual at Thiruvaiyaru temple in Thanjavur, which would be held in July-August, there would hardly be a couple of groups playing Kailaaya Vaadhiyam. Last year, there were around 100 groups,\" he recalls. This boom is also attributed to groups on a mission to revive traditional Tamil instruments. Chennai-based Kosai Nagaran is one such group. C Sivakumar, 32, organizer of the forum, says he quit his job to document and popularize these instruments. \"Through our research, we have documented 72 instruments mentioned in Tamil literary texts. We have 108 more that need to be documented,\" he says. Experts say traditional instruments faded from the scene in the 1980s when western instruments such as drums and band instruments became popular. \"Around 30 years ago, temple festivals featured traditional instruments such as the kombu. But now there are not many who make them or know how to repair them. We are managing with the instruments which we made in the 1980s,\" says S Gopal, a skilled worker at Sangita Vadyalaya, a museum of traditional instruments in Chennai. One of the reasons for the decline in use of traditional instruments was that they need careful maintenance. \"Drumheads of parai and murasu are made of animal hide and need to be heated over a fire to make them sound sharp. During monsoon they need to be heated and tuned. Plastic instruments such as drums and band instruments demand no such care,\" says Sivakumar of Kosai Nagaran. But musicality is sacrificed in the process. \"When played, traditional drums such as parai and murasu produce \u2018naadham\u2019, a tonality which is musical,\" he says. Kosai Nagaran also conducts programmes across the state, where they exhibit the instruments in their collection. However, musicologists say there needs to be more concerted efforts from the state and cultural institutions to document and preserve musical heritage. \"The state art and culture department should collect and preserve these instruments,\" says musician Arimalam S Padmanabhan.

Notices were issued to the establishments after a division bench of the Madras high court dismissed an appeal against a single judge order that directed reclamation of railway land near the Velachery MRTS station, which had been illegally occupied for 25 years. The court dismissed the appeal by Annai Indira Gandhi Hut Dwellers Welfare against an order which directed the government to reclaim the land from 97 'land owners' and hand over the property to Southern Railway for MRTS use. In 1992, the Tamil Nadu government passed an order (GO) proposing to allocate one cent of land each to 97 members of the association. In 1997, a tahsildar issued pattas for the land in favour of 312 people, against 97, illegally and they were terminated by the district collector as the tahsildar cannot issue pattas. Subsequently, in 2003, the GO was cancelled since the land was required for MRTS project. The association\u2019s petition challenging the GO cancelling the land allocation was dismissed by the single judge against which it filed an appeal. On Tuesday, officials armed with the high court order began demolition, dismissing protests by those who run the commercial establishments there.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

It has not only appointed 17 senior civil servants as \u2018facilitating officers\u2019 and distributed the entire set of large projects among them for follow up, it also added an entirely new dimension to its interaction with the investors. In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the government, through CII, recruited six experienced business professionals for a two-year term to act as \u2018facilitation executives\u2019 between investors and various government departments. While CII recruited these professionals, Tamil Nadu Industrial Guidance Bureau takes care of their \u201cpay\u201d, under an \u201coutsourcing\u201d model. As a result, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, in the next few days, will lay the foundation stone for 14 of those projects, with combined investments of over Rs 2,000 crore, besides inaugurating two smaller projects, which is ready to commence production, according to sources in the Tamil Nadu government. \u201cThe first edition of GIM came under flak due to lower conversion ratio of promised investments into actuals. We understood it was due to lack of steady follow up. Even though \u2018facilitating officers\u2019 were appointed even then, not many projects were followed up,\u201d a state government source told TOI. Of the promised Rs 2.42 lakh crore investments from GIM 1, only around Rs 66,000 crore worth of investments materialized, with energy sector\u2019s dismal show letting down the numbers. In the second edition of GIM this year, 304 MoUs across sectors were signed involving investments of more than Rs 3 lakh crore, resulting in employment opportunities for more than a million. Considering the importance and status of the MoU projects, the government decided and appointed senior officials as \u2018facilitating officers\u2019 to ensure the speedy implementation of projects. It also formed an \u2018Empowered Committee\u2019, headed by Industries secretary, to meet once in two months to review the progress of the MoUs signed in 2019. While the committee will deliberate on issues encountered in implementing them, the progress of MoU projects is to be placed before the Investment Promotion and Monitoring Board, headed by the chief minister, as per the Tamil Nadu Business Facilitation Act, 2018. \u201cThe CM is fast in clearing the files and this has given us a boost to seek out more investments. Today, we are more confident in responding to queries and issues that investors raise, than in the past,\u201d a state government official said.

Elsewhere, Mukundan, a junior intelligence agent, is assigned to shadow this young Muslim couple. The play follows the couple\u2019s life, as it is revealed through a series of characters - an old politician\u2019s telephone conversations with a powerful bureaucrat, exchanges between Laila and her widowed mother, the pain and regrets of Jamal\u2019s old father and Mukundan\u2019s interior monologues.

The film is set to release in about 100 screens across Tamil Nadu this Friday. While the move is in keeping with the trend witnessed over the past few years in the Tamil film industry that started with \u2018Karnan\u2019, unlike a few other old films that had a rerun digitally, \u2018Vasantha Maaligai\u2019 will not be competing for space in run-down theatres, but in multiplexes like Sathyam and Escape, as well as AGS and S2, with reservations opening on Wednesday. \u201cOur family is full of Sivaji fans. As a result, I became his fan at the age of 14, even though I watched other films. I wanted to show my fondness for Sivaji and was searching for the right film of his to be remastered digitally. Veteran director V C Guhanathan helped me get the rights for \u2018Vasantha Maaligai\u2019,\u201d says Shirdi Sathya Sai Films\u2019 P Nagaraja, who owns Groupcom Systems that offers data and voice communication services. Originally made in 35mm, the film has been remastered in Di colour, besides other technology upgrades including DTS, 4K Sony and 2K Qube. \u201cWe also had a fresh trailer and launched it in Chennai\u2019s Sathyam Cinemas on March 29. Despite being a working day, the hall was jampacked,\u201d he said. According to K Chandrasekaran, president, TNCC Arts Wing and Sivaji Social Welfare Association, the film\u2019s producer D Ramanaidu did not sell the satellite rights of \u2018Vasantha Maaligai\u2019 to any television channel. \u201cAs a result, whenever it hit theatres for rerun in its original form, it received a great response. In its digital avatar and technological upgrade, the expectation is much higher, with audience screaming \u2018once more\u2019, at theatres in Karur and other parts of state, when the trailer was played recently,\u201d Chandrasekaran said. Sivaji Ganesan\u2019s \u2018Karnan\u2019, ran to housefull shows when it was digitized about two years ago. Soon, several others joined the fray buying rights of old Sivaji and MGR films for digital mastering and reruns. \u201cOnly \u2018Karnan\u2019, in digital format, turned out to be a commercial hit due to its content and great music. The story of Mahabharata was told so crisply by the film\u2019s director B R Panthulu that it attracted younger audiences as well.

Sources have said party chief M K Stalin is reluctant to form a government for the residual term of the assembly as he is doubtful of showing numbers in the House. Also, the high expectations of the electorate would put lots of stress on the new government. In a short term, it is practically impossible for any government to fulfil promises like agriculture and education loan waivers, committed in abundant measure at the last hustings. And nobody wants to be in the saddle when a water crisis is at play. \u201cWe will only push for fresh elections whenever the government falls. We will not stake claim to form the government,\u201d said a senior DMK leader. With the Centre \u201cdetermined to play spoilsport\u201d, the DMK leadership is not confident of ushering in assembly elections in Tamil Nadu anytime soon. \u201cBy pulling down the government, we may play into the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Right now, the Centre is remote controlling the state government. If the AIADMK government falls, it will directly administer the state. Possibility of a protracted President\u2019s rule for one year cannot be ruled out, because the BJP leadership in Delhi may want to regain some of its lost ground during that period. It would also give enough time for the Centre to engage in some political manoeuvring in the state to keep the DMK-Congress at bay,\u201d said a DMK leader. The DMK\u2019s assessment is that if elections are held within six months of the government\u2019s fall, it will give the party rich dividends. Any further delay may give opportunity to possible new entrants like superstar Rajinikanth to establish. If Rajinikanth contests alone, it may not make much of an impact. But if he manages to trigger a mass movement for a change from Dravidian politics or becomes a rallying point for other parties, it will be a cause of concern for both the AIADMK and the DMK. Many senior AIADMK leaders, who are uncertain about their political future under the dual leadership of Edappadi K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam, may look at Rajinikanth as a credible alternative closer to polls. Instead of allowing someone else to reap the fruits of hard labour carried out by M K Stalin and co for more than four years, it would be prudent to wait till the government crumbles under its own weight, feels the DMK leadership. The EPS dispensation would meanwhile earn more bad name is the thought.

A woman who owned a house in the encroached area in tearsChennai district revenue officials said 176 buildings, including 111 for commercial purposes, had been constructed on about 1.5 acres of railway land in Annai Indira Nagar. While 56 were being used as residential-cum-commercial buildings, a mosque was also constructed without requisite documents. Around 9am, revenue department officials and railway officers armed with a Supreme Court order confirming the eviction, began the demolition that went on smoothly barring a few scenes of people crying. Earlier, as the police contingent arrived, workers at most of the shops in the seven commercial structures began clearing out. Those who came late were left to watch as earthmovers bulldozed their properties. \u201cElectricity was cut off on Saturday last. We were hoping the action would be delayed,\u201d said S Saravanan, employee of a restaurant in one of the buildings. Later in the day, members of an outfit protesting against demolition of the mosque were detained by police and the demolition resumed. It is expected to continue for a week. A division bench of the Madras high court confirmed the eviction in December 2018 and in February the squatters moved the Supreme Court, which dismissed their plea. \u201cDespite SC granting ten weeks, the encroachers did not vacate. Hence the railways took steps to demolish the buildings and evict them,\u201d said P T Ramkumar, standing counsel, Southern Railways, adding this would boost public confidence in courts.  Revenue officials said they had issued eviction notices to all the squatters weeks earlier. \u201cA fish market run by a local AIADMK leader is also on encroached land and demolition is set to begin in July as the owners have sought time from the apex court,\u201d said a railway engineer. The encroachments had their beginnings in 1992 with a government order proposing to allocate one cent of land each to 97 members of the Annai Indira Nagar Hut Dwellers Welfare Association. In 1997, a tahsildar issued pattas in favour of 312 people, against the 97 to whom the lands were originally allotted. The Chennai collector cancelled the pattas as tahsildars are not authorized to issue pattas in Chennai district and, in 2003, a fresh GO transferred the government poramboke land to railways for the MRTS project, and cancelled the earlier GO allotting one cent land.

Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said.

I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said.

There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out.

While the ruling AIADMK is concerned about completing its full term and willing to look at this beyond 2024, the opposition DMK feels such a move is impossible to implement. AIADMK is deputing law minister C Ve Shanmugam and RS floor leader A Navaneethakrishnan to attend the all-party meeting on June 19. \u201cIn its earlier representation to the Law Commission in New Delhi last year, the party demanded that the ruling dispensation should be allowed to complete its full term until 2021, but said it had no objections to simultaneous polls from 2024, if necessary. It remains unclear if the party high command maintains its status given the political dynamics,\u201d said a senior minister, seeking anonymity. \u201cWe had already taken a stand on this and I do not think there will be any change on that now. Our utmost concern is to complete the present term. Even last year, when the topic surfaced, Modi government was to advance elections to six states, including Maharashtra and Jharkhand, which are to face assembly polls in a few months from now. But, they did not do it,\u201d pointed out another minister, who did not want to be named. The DMK was of the stand that it was impossible to implement and depended on various factors. \u201cWhile we had general elections in 1989, 1991, 1996, 1998 and 1999, the Lok Sabha was dissolved in 1991, 1998 and 1999 for want of a majority for the ruling dispensation. If such a case is to arise later, will the state assemblies, where the ruling party may be in a majority, be dissolved?\u201d wondered DMK spokesman and party\u2019s RS member T K S Elangovan. \u201cSeveral states are ruled by parties, which have little or no role at the Centre. Their mandates are different. Such a move is not needed at all and it is impossible to implement it,\u201d he said. For its part, the PMK felt there were benefits, but issues too. \u201cOur youth wing leader (Anbumani Ramadoss) had earlier said it was a good move, considering the cost benefits. But, it is practically not possible to implement. Our party is yet to take a call on this,\u201d PMK spokesman K Balu said. \u201cFrom lowering expenditure aspect, it is a welcome move. But, there are issues in implementing it,\u201d he said. Former chief election commissioner T S Krishnamurthy said theoretically it was attractive and desirable too. \u201cBut, implementation wise there are problems and needs constitutional amendments. It is difficult to implement. While administrative wise, we will need more arrangements, it will surely result in savings on expenditure and may result in more administrative work for the legislatures. But, constitutional obstacles must be addressed and changed,\u201d said Krishnamurthy.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert.

He sought blessings from his supporters for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and asserted that the NDA government has left no stone unturned to bring about development in the state.

There is no dearth of funds when it comes to development work in the country. \"In the last five years, the government has been able to build homes for eight lakh families, light up 3,000 houses and provide gas connections to 40 lakh homes,\" Modi stated. Referring to Mission Shakti, when India demonstrated anti-satellite (ASAT) missile capability by shooting down a live satellite, he said the government has taken measures to set up a 'chowkidar' (watchman) in space. He came down heavily on opposition parties who he said \"belittled\" the space achievement. \"Those that are criticising the anti-satellite technology will be given a befitting reply in the elections,\" he claimed, urging people to vote for a government that can take concrete decisions, not the one that only raises slogans.

Recording the submission, a division bench of Justice M M Sundaresh and M Nirmal Kumar directed the government to find out whether Nalini has any objection or if she is willing to submit her contentions through video conferencing. In a recent hearing, the court made it clear that she could not be denied her right to appear in person to argue her case. Nalini, who has been in prison for over 27 years, wanted the high court to direct the superintendent of police of the Special Prison for Women in Vellore to produce her before the court so that she could argue her case for leave as a party-in-person. According to Nalini, a life convict is entitled to one month leave once in two years and since she had never availed such ordinary leave for more than 27 years, she made a representation to the prison authorities on February 25 seeking six months leave to make arrangement for her daughter\u2019s marriage. Subsequently, Nalini\u2019s mother also made a similar representation on March 22. As the authorities failed to consider her representation, she moved the high court. Originally, Nalini was sentenced to death. Subsequently, her death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the Tamil Nadu government on April 24, 2000.

With even borewells that used to yield highly saline water going dry in most places, people are looking to move to apartment complexes in the city that have supply of any kind of water at least for a few hours a day. Realtors say rentals are rising in apartment complexes that are able to ensure water supply to residents. \u201cThere is demand for apartments where the residents\u2019 welfare associations are able to ensure water supply. Customers are asking us to identify only such apartments. But cost of maintenance is going up in such apartments on account of increasing water charges. All these have resulted in indirect increase in rentals,\u201d said Jayant Hemdev, business director, Hemdev\u2019s Real Estate. Residents in some of the swanky suburbs are eyeing the core areas of the city, where the borewells still yield some water or the tanker service is better. \u201cWhat can one do when there is no water for your ablutions and daily chores?

A resident of an apartment complex in Vepery says he moved into it only a month ago. His search for another apartment complex has already started as there is no water in the present one. Scarcity is not caused merely by reduction in water supply by Metrowater. Drying up of borewells across the city and its suburbs has compounded the problem. When Metrowater used to supply 830 MLD of water in the past, Chennai residents used to also tap groundwater from borewells at will. But the borewells are drying up and, municipal administration minister S P Velumani admits, Metrowater supply has fallen to 525 MLD (million litres a day). The secretary of a residential complex near Anna Nagar says, \u201cOf late, we have been noticing that there is an influx of people into our building. On inquiry, we came to know that most of them are relatives of our members. They have moved into our building from different parts of the city in search of water. It is a strain on our pocket because cost of maintenance is shooting up. We never used to buy water from tankers.

The proximate causes are always the same. A patient dies or his or her condition worsens, and the patient\u2019s relatives feel doctors have not given enough care. In crowded public sector hospitals, people may have this perception due to the sheer volume of patients and the inadequate number of medical personnel. However, the fact that violence occurs in private hospitals too, where the number of patients is not as much, points to a trust deficit between patients and doctors. The Indian Medical Association in a study has shown that 75% of doctors face some sort of violence, verbal or physical, in their career. The reasons for the trust deficit are multiple. In public sector hospitals, there is a perception that doctors do not respect them are, uncaring or are not the best, else they would be working in the private sector. In the private sector they are seen as out to make money and not committed enough. The common thread is that doctors are not caring enough. The structure of medical training and practice in India is such that such a perception of the medical profession among the public is almost inevitable. The medical profession continues to remain one of the most sought after by students. But in the past few decades there has been a dramatic shift in the way medicine is practised. The advent of advanced technology in medical care, mainly in the private sector, has given rise to unreasonable expectations in the minds of the public that medical care can solve any ailment. The situation is worsened by the continuous barrage of advertisement by the private sector, much of it misleading, if not downright dishonest. The public has been given the impression that no one can die in a hospital, if the doctor is skillful enough and caring enough. In spite of all this, violence against the doctor would be infrequent if there was a general respect for civic values. In the absence of effective redressal measures, people take law into their own hands either out of desperation or because they are aware that perpetrators of such violence are seldom, if ever, brought to book. To immediately stop such violence against doctors, the state should take exemplary action against those indulging in violence. In any civilized society, justice has to be delivered by a fair mechanism. Only failed republics resort to violent vigilante action. Should doctor\u2019s strike? In the best of all possible worlds, they should not. When they are the targets of violence, and no redressal seems possible, it is understandable that they will resort to such means as will draw attention to their plight. The fact that it has taken so many days to resolve shows that society is uncaring of their distress. In the long term, the ability of every individual to access quality healthcare through a transparent system is the way forward. This requires greater funding and a complete change in the way medical care is delivered in the country.

A division bench of Justice MM Sundaresh and M Nirmal Kumar directed the government to find out Nalini\u2019s opinion on the issue after Tamil Nadu government raised a security concern and opposed her plea to appear in court and argue her case in person.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Gas hydrates are ice-like cages, found in Indian continental coastline, in which methane gas is trapped. According to official data, over 1,900 trillion cubic meters of methane gas is untapped in these cages. This is 1,500 times more than country\u2019s present gas reserve. Methane, in the form of natural gas, is used to generate electricity and make energy. The researchers are studying new methane extraction methods so that country's natural gas import will come down. The research is being headed by professor Jitendra Sangwai from IITM\u2019s ocean engineering department. Gas hydrates should be dissociated into their constituent gas and water before methane recovery is possible, said Sangwai. Four techniques are being studied in various laboratories for this dissociation thermal stimulation, depressurisation, chemical injection and carbon dioxide injection. Sangwai\u2019s team analyses the combined effects of thermal stimulation and depressurisation in one branch of study, and polymer injection in another, said a press release. The research team reported that combination of two processes in more efficient for methane production from hydrates. This was attributed to relatively faster increase in volume available for the gas to expand upon application of heat. Also, instead of single-step, multistep depressurisation is more efficient. So, depressurisation is possibly the most likely technology to mature in near future, the release added. As far as polymer injection is concerned, researchers reported that eco-friendly polymer (polyethylene glycol-200) is best suited for extracting methane from hydrate. \u201cControlled extraction of methane from gas hydrates can not only meet the demand but can also reduce detrimental geological release of greenhouse gas into the environment from these sources,\u201d Sangwai said.

The Rs 65lakh buoy, funded by the Centre as part of a pilot project to automate coastal water quality monitoring, was to be officially inaugurated by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) on Wednesday. Researchers in the know said that a team from NCCR, who were on a boat, were testing the buoy around 11.20am when an Indian Navy patrol boat, the fast interceptor craft, arrived. The buoy was deployed about 2km from Chennai coast and anchored at a depth of 2m. \u201cThey did not allow the team to even respond. The Navy personnel scared them with their guns and toppled the buoy before they sped away. The sensors attached to the buoy were damaged,\u201d a researcher said. \u201cThey could have cross-checked with the Institute, as the buoy had both the government of India emblem and the name of the institute on it,\u201d an official said. NCCR, an erstwhile project directorate and now a research lab operating under MoES has been mandated with monitoring coastal water quality across the country and recommend solutions to tackle marine pollution. NCCR scientists said they had informed all authorities concerned including the Tamil Nadu Coastal Security Group and Indian Coast Guard under whose jurisdiction the buoy was deployed. \u201cWe had informed the Navy about the deployment through the Indian Coast Guard,\u201d a researcher said. \u201cWe do not know the extent of the damage to the buoy yet. We are trying to bring it back to the coast.\u201d The buoy was fitted with several high cost sensors that can measure and send real time data on various water quality parameters. It includes temperature, salinity, turbidity, conductivity, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen, acidity, and data on wave and current. The data will help research detect pollution resulting in algal bloom, mass fish kill and foaming in coastal waters faster than before. So far coastal water quality has been monitored across 7500km of the Indian coast manually, where scientists periodically venture into the sea and collect water samples to test them in their laboratories. Oceanographers with national labs said they have experienced several incidents where buoys deployed by them were vandalised by fishermen, who would escape with the solar panels attached to such floating devices. \u201cThe buoy was the result of three years hard work. We do not know when and how we can find a replacement for the device,\u201d a scientist said. Calls and messages to the Indian Navy public relations officer in Chennai went unanswered.

There was a time when assembly byelections in the state were boycotted by opposition parties, such was the ominous display of muscle and money power, along with use of official machinery. But, in a reversal of the trend, the AIADMK, despite being friendly with the BJP-led government at the Centre, is struggling to face elections. The absence of the towering figure of J Jayalalithaa is being deeply felt. Jayalalithaa\u2019s AIADMK did not lose a byelection in the period from 1991 to 1996, 2001 to 2006, and 2011 onwards. On the contrary, the AIADMK, led by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami lost the crucial RK Nagar bypoll to rebel leader T T V Dhinakaran and again 13 of the 22 bypoll seats last month. Earlier, major parties had occasionally kept away from byelections rather than suffer defeats by huge margins, which tend to demoralize their cadres and ruling parties have tended to showcase these victories to boost their sense of superiority. So what has changed for the AIADMK, which enjoys the backing of the Centre, while its arch-rival M Karunanidhi of the DMK is no more? Though the AIADMK concentrated on the 22 assembly bypolls and deputed a galaxy of ministers in the campaigning, the DMK managed to win 13 seats, including prestigious ones like Andipatti, from where Jayalalithaa was elected in 2002 and 2006. Next up is the local body polls pending for nearly three years. Now it is the opposition that is itching for elections and believes it to be an opportunity for a changeover, while the AIADMK is on the defensive. On the ground, however, nothing has changed. Most of the voters are still inclined to accept freebies, cash-for-votes too during byelections. From RK Nagar to Sulur, the opposition has been able to trounce the AIADMK\u2019s muscle power. A change that has come about in the mindset of the electorate is the feeling that one can accept freebies from one party and vote for another. Though frowned upon by the  Commission, such dealings continue. With offer of money from various sides, loyalty is no more a factor. The biggest challenge for the AIADMK is the uncomfortable questions raised against its legitimacy and leadership. Ever since Jayalalithaa was hospitalized, games of political upmanship while jockeying for power was the new mantra, with Resort politics being thrown in. Questions are being raised about the foundation of the government. The twists and turns, rebellion, constant shifting of sides and positions, claims and counter-claims of support among MLAs, have all led to the charge that the government survives as it is a beneficiary of the acts of the governor, election commission and the Centre. The perception is that the fragile government, which survives on a wafer-thin majority thanks to the disqualification moves, relies heavily on the BJP to bail it out. While Jayalalithaa avoided an alliance with the BJP to prevent a consolidation of minority votes in favour of the DMK-led combine, the EPS government is in a catch-22 situation where it needs the BJP\u2019s help to survive and yet this pushes the AIADMK into the \"unpopular\" NDA bandwagon. Thus, an anti-incumbency factor, coupled with feelings against the BJP in the state have proved to be a double whammy for the AIADMK. This situation has been well-fashioned and crafted by the DMK, with its new president M K Stalin, winning over several parties to his side and creating a formidable opposition to the AIADMK. It is not that EPS has done badly as chief minister. He has been accessible, acquired the reputation of clearing files quickly and kept the flock of MLAs happy. Left to himself, EPS would have reached a compromise with the Dhinakaran group and kept them within the AIADMK fold. What is galling for him is that having expelled them, he is now asked to take them back, after they ruined the party\u2019s prospects in the 2019 elections. Such U-turns have weakened the party in the eyes of the people and also caused confusion within the ranks. That is why every bypoll brings a crisis for the AIADMK which struggles without a charismatic leader like MGR or Jayalalithaa to bring them non-committed votes.

Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

However, despite the land being allotted to the railways, illegal structures were allowed to come up on the encroached land in the past decade and half- providing pattas, electricity and water connections. A railway official said two AIADMK leaders raised buildings and rented them out to commercial enterprises. One of them, who runs a fish market and whose appeal against an eviction notice was dismissed by the Madras high court, has still sought time from the Supreme Court. The market will be demolished in two weeks, railways officials said. Lodging facilities, restaurants, clinics, scan centres, yoga studios and even a NEET coaching centre had sprung up in the illegal buildings. All were brought down. The owner of a lodging facility who claimed to have bought the property six years ago and several others appealed to the authorities, showing receipts of property tax, electricity bills. Some asked if the authorities would demolish colleges and hospitals built on such land. The police personnel present maintained a stoic response, \u201cAuthorities are just following court orders. We are here only for protection,\u201d said an officer. Railway officials blamed the revenue, corporation and registration departments for enabling the encroachments. \u201cWithout the support of government departments, these businesses could not have run. Most commercial establishments have come up in the past 10 years, now paying Rs 30,000 a month for about 430 sq ft,\u201d an official said. The Madras high court has asked the inspector general of registration to find out how many properties had been sold with the connivance of the sub-registrar concerned.

Not convinced with the eight-page report filed by Metrowater elaborating the measures it has taken to overcome the situation, a division bench of Justice S Manikumar and Justice Subramonium Prasad wondered what the water management department of the state was doing all these days. The authorities very well knew that the lakes in and around the city are drying but still no precautionary measures were taken to arrange alternate sources for the past one year, the bench said. Ridiculing the authorities for submitting that they have started awareness programmes highlighting the importance of water conservation, the bench wondered what is the use of doing such awareness work at this point of time. The bench then suo motu impleaded the secretary of PWD to file a report on the steps taken to de-silt four major reservoirs in the city and availability of water. The bench said judicial notice can also be taken that some of the waterbodies have been encroached which has reduced the size of the lake and encroachment is also said to be one of the causes of the reduction of storage capacity of lakes and water bodies. The court then directed the secretary who is vested with the custody of preserving the lakes to submit a detailed report of the steps taken for removal of encroachment. In this regard the secretary is directed to issue a circular to all the district collectors to submit the details of action taken for removal of encroachments in waterbodies, the court said. As the advocate general submitted that once the third desalination plant being established in Nemelli becomes functional, even failure of monsoon would not affect Chennai, the bench directed the authorities to submit a report of desalination project taken up by the government, study, if any, done for additional desalination plants. The court then posted the plea to June 26 for further hearing.

While its lone MP in the LS and 13 members in RS will raise concerns of the state and move amendments, it will not stand in the way of passage of crucial bills in both Houses, sources said. The controversial clauses of the bills were taken up by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami in his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, seeking his intervention. \u201cThere will not be any confrontation with the Centre nor any opposition to the bills. We will continue to raise the concerns of the state as they (Centre) are concerned about the entire nation. The amendments will be moved by the MPs as per instructions from the high command,\u201d said a senior AIADMK leader. While the dam safety bill was introduced in LS in December last year, the motor vehicles amendments bill was passed in April and both lapsed with the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha. The Tamil Nadu assembly had passed an unanimous resolution in June last year not to enact a law on dam safety until the states were consulted and consensus was evolved. The main concern of the state was that the bill envisages a national dam safety authority that would act as state dam safety organization for a dam located in one state and owned by another. It would only mean that the state owning the dam would have no rights over the safety and maintenance of the dam located in another state. Mullaperiyar, Parambikulam, Thunakadavu and Peruvaripallam dams are owned, operated and maintained by Tamil Nadu by inter-state agreements, but located in Kerala. With 37 MPs, the AIADMK, as the third largest party in Parliament, had raised strong objections when the bills were introduced last year. \u201cThis time, the AIADMK will only object to eroding the rights of Tamil Nadu, which is a violation of the federal principles, and seek amendments to the clauses,\u201d said a senior minister. While the Centre aims at reforming the transport sector with the proposed amendments to Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the Tamil Nadu government demands that the Centre modifies five clauses, which even overruns the nationalisation policy of the state. A clause eliminates the monopoly of the states to carry on transport business and feared to weaken or even terminate the service of state transport undertakings.
