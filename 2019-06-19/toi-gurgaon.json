A young woman arrives at Huda City Centre metro station in a Yellow Line train from Delhi and begins walking down, towards the exit. She reaches the escalator that takes people to the station compound. A secure place, seemingly, with CCTV surveillance, and enough people around to make anyone feel safe. But while she is on the escalator, she gets the feeling of being followed. Then she feels a presence just behind her. It gives her the creeps. On Monday afternoon, after a weekend spent poring through CCTV footage, seething at the police\u2019s lack of initiative, and grappling with the question whether to continue staying on in Gurugram or not, the 29-year-old woman decided she would let the world know what had happened at the metro station. On the escalator on Friday night, she had instinctively turned around. It was around 9.25pm.  There were others too, but right in front of her, stood a man, a stranger. He was masturbating. And he was looking at her.\u201cI confronted him and slapped him,\u201d she told TOI on Monday, adding the man, who seemed to be in his mid-20s, responded with a volley of abuses. She said she also screamed to draw fellow commuters\u2019 attention but no one reacted. \u201cNo one came forward, not even the women standing near me,\u201d she said, emphasising the need for discussions and measures to increase safety in public spaces, particularly for women. \u201cWe do not need free rides. We need safety. We want safety, which every government has failed to provide despite multiple promises,\u201d she wrote in her tweet. \u201cI sent the same message to DMRC and I immediately got a call from them, following which I was asked to identify the man on CCTV footage (which she did). \u201cGurugram police got in touch with me only after my tweets,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to file a complaint and pursue this case because it is time we start speaking about the need for safe spaces for women,\u201d she added. \u201cBut at the same time, I am scared about my own safety.\u201d Police\u2019s delayed response has only made those apprehensions worse. A Gurugram police spokesperson said they would start an investigation. \u201cWe received a complaint through Twitter. We have asked her to submit a written application and record her statement on Monday, following which we will start the investigation,\u201d said police spokesperson Subhash Boken. This is the second episode of perverted behaviour to be reported in the last 10 days from a metro train or station compound. Last week, an auto driver was arrested for flashing a woman inside a train between Sikanderpur and MG Road metro stations. When the woman raised an alarm, commuters nabbed him and handed him over to the police.

The world\u2019s major cities are such power brands. Think of Paris, London and New York, and a plethora of images and emotions are instantly evoked. These cities have been photographed heavily by tourists and professional photographers. Their architectural landmarks are known to millions around the world, including those who have never set foot there. Their streets and culture have been captured in countless movies and hence are familiar not just to residents but worldwide audiences. The black cabs of London and yellow taxis of New York are visual icons. Great authors have set their stories in those cities and made their landscapes famous. In India, the old metros are such power brands: Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai. Mumbai and Delhi, in particular, have been captured in countless photographs as well as movie scenes. Which brings me to Gurugram, which has been home for 12 years now. While being attached to Delhi as part of NCR, Gurugram is a city in its own right, variously described as Millennium City and a corporate hub. New Gurugram is consciously modelled on cities such as Singapore and Dubai, in its design and way of life, with glitzy steel-and-glass downtown work areas (Cyber City), malls and pedestrianised zones (Cyber Hub), and residences in condominiums and gated communities. A huge segment of the city\u2019s population is not local Haryanvis but professionals and workers from various parts of India, or those who have moved from Delhi. Many are also transitory, coming to Gurugram to work for a few years, before moving back to the cities they came from, or to which their professional ambitions take them. Who, then, loves Gurugram? What images and feelings does Gurugram evoke? What does Gurugram symbolise? If it\u2019s just the name of a township, then the attachments are only to friends made while living there, and to a few places in and around one\u2019s residence. But if it is to become a symbol of new aspirations, and dreams of global living (as the names of the various condos would suggest) in a way that evokes pride and not derision, then what is Gurugram defined by? Enough critical commentary has been written on Gurugram by journalists, choosing to see the lifestyle of Gurugram residents as pretentious and wannabe rather than as something deeper and more meaningful. To love Gurugram, it should all start with the question: what should a Gurugram resident be called? How should we identify ourselves? What\u2019s our shared identity (especially now that the city has been officially renamed Gurugram)? Are we Gurugram-ers? Or Gurugrammers? Or just Gurus? Or Gurugram-kars? Or indeed, Gurugram-ites? It\u2019s difficult to turn the city into a power brand if the residents don\u2019t know what to call themselves, if there is no label that falls easily off the tongue (like Parisians and Londoners, or Mumbaikars and Delhiites). So, what parts of the city do we, its residents, feel proud of and happy to show to friends, family and other visitors? Do we love showing off Cyber Hub, Galleria market and Kingdom of Dreams? Or just the gated communities we live in? Which parts of the city would photographers, filmmakers, writers and other creative folk living in Gurugram want to romance through their art and craft? Or is it that the city\u2019s lifestyle of middle and elite class aspiration lacks the sheer tension and human churn that cities like Mumbai and old Delhi have, which inspire writers to romanticise them? As Gurugram grows, will its various areas develop a distinctive enough character to be labelled as neighbourhoods? Right now, sadly, the city\u2019s decision-makers seem to be quite happy to have it live up to its \u2018corporate city\u2019 moniker by getting sponsors for Rapid Metro and turning each of its stations into a corporate billboard. And Gurugram\u2019s resident professionals are all happy to stay here for the convenience and comfort of condo-living and the milling crowds that are a central feature of India\u2019s old and big cities. But, are we willing to love Gurugram? And showcase that love?

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar.

Dr Gathwala, who is accused of harassing Dr Onkar to such an extent that he committed suicide, also hinted at internal politics of the PGIMS for her being held responsible for the suicide. In her complaint, Dr Gathwala alleged that the students broke open the gate of her house and the doors around 12.45pm on Saturday, when she, her husband, daughter and son were at home. \u201cThey suddenly invaded my residence and vandalised it.

Dr Gathwala has been booked under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code, for allegedly abetting Dr Onkar\u2019s suicide.

As many as 40 birds are admitted to the hospital suffering from aforesaid symptoms, and every day a handful of new cases are pouring in. There are 308 birds in the hospital currently being nursed back to health. And, it\u2019s both native and exotic species that are struggling to cope with soaring temperatures, among them rock pigeons, blue rock pigeons, doves and eagles, as well as species of parrot like lovebirds, budgerigars and macaws. While some residents have noticed instances of birds dropping from trees out of sheer exhaustion, many have found them straining to take flight, whether from the ground or terrace. \u201cOn Thursday, I found a dove struggling to open its wing near a water bowl on my terrace. I took the bird to a shady place. I tried to give it some water but the bird was not able to open its eyes,\u201d shared Deepak Lal, a resident of Sushant Lok-3. \u201cI immediately took the bird to the hospital \u2014 the doctor told me that the bird is suffering from heat stroke, but thankfully they managed to save it.\u201d This dove, then, was lucky to escape death. However, on many occasions, birds are dead by the time they are brought into the hospital, because they could not receive relief on time. \u201cUnlike humans, birds can\u2019t have sweat glands \u2014 it is, therefore, difficult for them to escape heat. So, it is extremely important to give early treatment to birds suffering from heat stroke \u2014 if not given timely treatment, birds suffer from paralysis and, sometimes, disability for entire life,\u201d explained Dr. Rajkumar of the Jain Charitable Bird Hospital. Alas, climate change affects avian species as much as it does humans, and ornithologists and bird lovers alike have raised concerns over the increase in cases of heat-related disorders. \u201cUnfortunately, winged creatures are the first victims of an increase in temperature as their organs are small, and thus they can\u2019t retain enough water and nutrients in their body for a long time. Birds, therefore, lose energy very quickly,\u201d informed Kavitha, a city-based birder. \u201cFeeding them water and food after short intervals is recommended. While this can be done in the case of pets, free-ranging birds often find it difficult to get water and food. Thus, they are more prone to heat stroke,\u201d she added. Doctors advise that bird feeders be cleaned regularly, to prevent birds getting infected. \u201cMore than the heat, they struggle to find cold water and shade to rest. People should keep cold water in a shady place on their terrace or ground, for the birds,\u201d told Dr. Rajkumar, who also advised that ORS or electrolytes be added to the water to ensure that they receive sufficient nutrients. And, should a bird be immobilised by the conditions, it would be prudent to take it to a patch of shade, and give it first aid without delay. \u201cIf a bird is found struggling with the heat, the bird should immediately be taken to a cooler place and a few drops of water put on their head,\u201d Dr. Rajkumar suggested. For those sensitive to the plight of our feathered friends, this is advice that can prove to be the difference between life and death.

Police commissioner Muhamad Akil said one of the accused had once saw Taneja \u2014 lone breadwinner of the family, counting cash at his shop. \u201cPresuming that the trader keeps a lot of cash in the shop, the accused contacted another criminal, and the duo later roped in one more criminal from UP to execute the crime,\u201d said Akil.

They identified the accused on the scooter and matched him with the criminal records. The person on the scooter turned out to be Suraj Katari from Basai, a history-sheeter, against whom more than six cases of loot, robbery and snatching are registered at different police stations of Gurugram. Kataria had come out of jail in January. A team led by Varun Dahiya, in-charge of the crime unit of Sector 39 on Saturday managed to arrest Suraj Kataria from Bahadurgarh bus stand.

Manoj told him about garment shop owner Taneja, saying he is making lots of money and every day he carries cash after closing the shop at night.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

According to ACP crime, Shamsher Singh, the woman, who is yet to file a written complaint, has been requested to record a statement. \u201cWe have registered a complaint against an unidentified man and we are currently trying to identify and locate the accused. We are looking at the CCTV feed from the spot,\u201d said Singh. On Friday night, the woman was allegedly harassed by a man in his 20s when she was walking towards the exit at the Huda City Centre metro station. She told TOI that the man stood in front of her and masturbated, and when she confronted him and slapped him, he screamed at her. She further said no one had come to her rescue. The woman had written to Gurugram Police on Facebook Messenger on Friday itself with details of the incident. However, when she did not get a response till Monday, she took to Twitter to share her ordeal. She also reached out to DMRC and identified the accused in the CCTV feeds provided by them on Sunday. \u201cI want to file a complaint and pursue this case because it is time we start speaking about the need for safe spaces for women,\u201d she told TOI. \u201cBut at the same time, I am scared about my own safety.\u201d Police\u2019s delayed response has only made those apprehensions worse.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

However, with two flyovers being recently developed at these intersections, the need for traffic lights raises a question over the administration\u2019s planning at the initial stage. At Hero Honda Chowk, an underpass and a flyover, built at a cost of Rs 138 crore, have eased problems for long-route traffic. \u201cThe traffic is smooth while going to or coming from Manesar, but taking a turn towards Sector 10 under the flyover is still cumbersome due to merging vehicles and non-availability of signals,\u201d said Aman Chawla, a city resident. Traffic experts say while the underpass and the flyover have helped in reducing congestion, there are still issues at Hero Honda Chowk due to the movement of vehicles in multiple directions. \u201cAs per my understanding, the traffic lights are being installed to streamline the traffic at the junction, which still sees some haphazard movement,\u201d said Sewa Ram of School of Planning and Architecture. The situation is worst at MDI Chowk. According to MCG sources, the original plan was to build a flyover for traffic coming from Atul Katria Chowk and going towards Signature Towers. However, the plan was later tweaked and the flyover was instead built for the traffic coming from Sukhrali and going towards Atul Kataria Chowk. The last-minute changes at the junction have made the situation worse, causing the need for a traffic signal at the junction. \u201cA study showed that maximum traffic flows from Atul Kataria Chowk towards Signature Towers. This is because a large number of people from Old Gurugram coming towards New Gurugram use Atul Kataria Chowk and MDI Chowk. That was the reason why it was decided to build the flyover in that direction but later on, on the instruction of some bureaucrats, the direction was changed,\u201d said a senior MCG official.

Among the farmers who suffer due to non-availability of water at tail end are those from Meham Chaubishi's Nindana, Khattar's native village. While the Meham Minor canal was flowing in full glory on June 16 when this correspondent visited the spot, farmers in villages of Tetri, Kheri and Nindana were using diesal-run tubewell to irrigate their land as the canal by side of their field was lying dry. Talking to TOI, Ramesh Kumar, an aged farmer from Nindana village sitting inside the parched canal at tail-end said that in last five years, not even a drop of water has been seen. \"The BJP government makes hollow claim of providing water to tail-end fields from public stages in urban areas to grab the imagination of voters by talking about transforming the lives of farmers. But the reality for farmers like us remains unchanged. The situation is only turning from bad to worse,\" Kumar added.

Bhoop Singh of Kheri village, who has his two acres at tail-end of Meham minor branch, said that he had heard that farmers commit suicide due to agriculture crisis and he could understand why. \"What should we do with dry land.

According to officials of GMDA\u2019s engineering wing, the surveys will either be conducted annually or biennially. Roughness index is a measure of texture of a road surface. It tests the number of potholes or craters per kilometre. This survey will be done on all master roads under GMDA\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201cRoughness index of a road will help us understand its current condition and the frequency of repair required,\u201d said a GMDA official. He added that if the number of craters on a stretch exceeds permissible limit, they will need immediate repair. Peak volume capacity will be used to understand if traffic at a particular junction is within its capacity or beyond. In case a junction witnesses more traffic than its capacity, it would cause traffic jams, requiring both short- and long- term solutions. \u201cIn such a case, we\u2019ll either need to widen roads or build an underpass/flyover, depending on need,\u201d said the official. As of now, flyovers/underpasses are developed based on traffic reports, without any prior survey. Finally, road safety audit (RSA) will help GMDA identify accident-prone zones in the city. Once complete, the authority can use the audit to identify the need for speedbreakers and signboards, as required. In addition, the mobility plan will also help GMDA understand the need for new projects, such as underpasses and flyovers.

Why, even dating apps are turning to AI to enhance user experience like checking the authenticity of profiles that they are likely to see. But how good is deep tech in searching for a soulmate? And how much can you really rely on AI in matters of the heart?  Shubhra Pant  finds out In an episode of the British science-fiction series, \u2018Black Mirror\u2019, a couple is playing a simulation-based game. They are given multiple scenarios to test their compatibility, and see how their relationship would work. After a favourable outcome, the two decide to pair off and try their luck. While a Black Mirror might make it seem that looking for love is easy, humankind is still far off from such a sci-fi vision. However, companies in the matchmaking and dating business are already throwing in deep tech to better understand tender matters of the heart: after all, if algorithms can customise everything for you, from social media to travel, why not the search for a soulmate? The idea, to begin with, is simple \u2014 use data and algorithms to cut down on time spent on browsing profiles. Because, according to Pawan Gupta, co-founder of Betterhalf.ai, which calls itself a matchmaking app for professionals, Indians go through roughly 10,000 profiles every year, spending around 1,000 hours on dating or matchmaking apps. That\u2019s an average of 28 profiles per day. No wonder the percentage of online swipes to offline dates remains very low.  A kundli for the tech age Betterhalf\u2019s primary objective, says Gupta, is to significantly bring down the number of profiles men and women must browse in their pursuit of matrimony. Artificial intelligence is a tool that can help them achieve that. \"Hence, we use big data and AI to help people find better-suited people on our platform,\" he adds. Unlike a typical matrimonial portal, Betterhalf provides a list of possible matches but doesn\u2019t let you surf. Gupta, interestingly, came upon the idea for an algorithm-based matchmaker when searching for his own partner. He went on to marry her. So, how does it work? Well, after logging in, a user takes a survey in which s/he is asked questions on topics as different as values and beliefs, intellectual levels and social skills, relationships and emotional preferences. The information collated from the questionnaire is clubbed with a separate cache of data collected from surveys of those who are happily married. Then algorithms take a deep dive and fish out what they believe are the best matches for you. As Manoj Singh, an infrastructure developer with a leading financial company who found his soulmate online says, \"It isn\u2019t easy to describe why you like someone and why you dislike someone \u2013 it is an internal process which is difficult to put into words.\" So, sometimes, you just trust the AI and see what happens. Betterhalf currently has around 14,000 (approx.) users in the National Capital Region, 11,000 in Mumbai and Bangalore, and 6,500 in Pune and Hyderabad. Eighty per cent of those registered on the app are from metros. Clearly, plenty of urban Indians are happy to confide in AI to make their life decision for them.  Date with data Figures from data analyst Tracxn show 261 online dating and matchmaking apps were founded in India between 2001 and 2019. And while both Banihal and Betterhalf are new kids on the block serving niches, even established players like OkCupid and Bumble are turning to AI to enhance user experience. Global dating app OkCupid, part of the Match Group (which also owns Tinder), is a case in point, working on the principle of matching users based on their answers to a series of questions \u2014 a function powered by AI. Like Betterhalf, there\u2019s Banihal.com, which also relies on AI to arrange matches. It also asks users to fill in an exhaustive questionnaire, in which they are required to reveal their financial background, family\u2019s monthly income, and likes and dislikes (among other details). \"A great match is when you don\u2019t have to compromise on any of the aspects, such as religion, culture and family,\" says Ishdeep Sawhney, the California-based founder of Banihal. The website caters mainly to Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune, but also has users from Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities in India (and from the US, too). \"When we make this decision, we don\u2019t have hard limits like, the age (of the partner) has to be 27 \u2013 because, depending on all the other unique aspects we like, the age can be 28 as well,\" Sawhney explains. Banihal, he clarifies, restricts itself to professionals aged between 25 and 30 since an AI engine can only be trained for a certain subset, and cannot be randomly applied to everyone. And, once singles have connected with each other, Banihal has a 90% success rate, claims Sawhney (incidentally, on the app, compatibility is represented by three gold rings, while the best matches are distinguished by a diamond ring).  Math of a match For these tech platforms, the key is to save users from the endless cycle of searches. After all, the process of browsing and swiping, does get exhausting after a while. \"The problem is that no one really has the time to go through thousands of profiles and talk to hundreds of people to go on a date \u2013 and even after that, there is no guarantee of these dates working out,\" says a 28-year-old MBA graduate, who requested not to be named. \"I once matched with a man who thought I was too opinionated for a lady when his profile suggested that he was a liberal and feminist,\" she added. Melissa Hobley, chief marketing officer at OkCupid, says the app allows people to connect at a deeper level, through beliefs and interests, for example, rather than just a photo and location. It does this by employing an algorithm centred on machine learning. \"The idea behind the app\u2019s algorithm is to take over the conventional task of being introduced by friends or family in the digital medium,\" she told TOI. \"The deep-math AI has two key differences \u2014 one, the system allows people to connect beyond their social circles, and two, as a non-judgmental platform, users can be their true self and be honest about relationship expectations without the fear of social stigma, making for more meaningful matches,\" she added. And this holds true for every type of relationship, not just heteronormative, according to Hobley. Thus, sex, gender, identity and preference can be shared directly, and the algorithm will present a relevant match. Meanwhile, Bumble, which is partially owned by Priyanka Chopra, believes artificial intelligence can make the app a safer place for its users. Earlier this month, Bumble launched Private Detector, a feature that can capture images in real time with 98% accuracy. Once a lewd image is shared within a chat, the Private Detector will automatically blur that image and alert the user they have been sent something inappropriate. Users can then decide, according to a Bumble spokesperson, whether to view the image or block it. They can also report the image to its team of moderators.  AIs and nays But more personal information on the web, in times when concerns on invasion of privacy, snooping by apps and data collection by online companies, isn\u2019t always a comforting thought. Some users, for instance, find the questions asked by matchmaking websites intrusive. \"While I understand the need for most questions, I don\u2019t understand the need to ask about family income and caste. On the one hand, we are trying to transcend caste and class boundaries, on the other these apps focus a lot on them,\" rues Urvashi Kingrani, an event manager based in Gurugram. Besides, points out Kingrani, AI assumes that people with similar interests and attributes are likely to get along, which isn\u2019t necessarily true in real life. \"Often, totally opposite people make great partners,\" she adds. Further, most apps don\u2019t score very high when it comes to inclusiveness, despite most claiming to serve the LGBTQ community. A Delhi resident disclosed she had sampled many apps but only one worked. \"I tried one app that had an option for LGBT but nothing for transsexuals and pansexuals. In my opinion, there has to be more freedom to define oneself on the app, and what they are looking for.\" Evidently, there will be no dearth of examples when artificial intelligence is no match for the heart (and mind), for all the permutations that algorithms can throw up. Yet, with more and more Indians ending up on dating and matchmaking sites, there\u2019s no reason to disbelieve the marriage of tech and tradition won\u2019t (or can\u2019t) work either. Because, finally, it\u2019s not about how AI uses you, it\u2019s how you use AI.

The last round of harassment occurred after cops at a police station \u201crefused to register her complaint\u201d but, instead, referred her to the \u201cright police station\u201d.   Cops from Bhowanipore arrived around 10-15 minutes later. It was past midnight by then and Sengupta decided to pursue the case on Tuesday morning and requested the cabby to drop her colleague and her off at their homes. But the nightmare was far from being over. \u201cThe boys had followed us till my colleague\u2019s house and, right when we were dropping him at Lake Gardens, six of them on three bikes came and stopped the car. They pelted stones, smashing the window. They then dragged me out and tried to break my phone to delete the video. Luckily, local people heard my cries for help and came out. The boys then fled,\u201d Sengupta recalled.   She then called her father and sister; her own residence was just a lane away. They called cops, who came and asked her to file an FIR at the Charu Market police station. It was 1.30 a.m. when she reached there but, instead of taking down her complaint, the cops there directed her to Bhowanipore police station where the first assault had occured. \u201cI just gave up and started shouting at this point. There was no female police officer. The officer there finally took down my complaint after asking a lot of questions but refused to take the cabby\u2019s complaint, stating that two FIR could not be taken for the same incident,\u201d she said. Frustrated and hapless, she returned home. It was at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday that she posted the entire ordeal on Facebook along with a 20-second video clip. An additional CP later called Sengupta and assured her of strong action against not just the accused but an inquiry into police refusal to take her complaint citing jurisdiction issues. \u201cThe probe has just begun and we have identified all the culprits. More arrests are likely and we will probe whether there was lack of adequate response from cops,\u201d said a Lalbazar official. The arrested were identified as Sheikh Rahit, Fardeen Khan, Sheikh Shabir Ali, Sheikh Gani, Sheikh Imran Ali, Sheikh Wasim and Atif Khan alias Md Samsad. A preliminary inquiry revealed the cab had accidentally brushed against the bike, causing the riders to lose balance. One of the bikes\u2019 rear view mirrors broke and the youths accosted cabby Tarak Debnath to demand compensation. At least two more bikes and an auto carrying more people landed there, leading to the sequence of events ending with the assault at Lake Gardens, officials said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option. We need to see how this will pan out.\" In Video:Bill seeking to lift green card cap amended to protect US workersDownload The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."}, "Bollywood actors who would be great teachers": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/bollywood-actors-who-would-be-great-teachers/photostory/65684334.cms", "description": ""}, "Samsung": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/heres-how-samsung-got-mocked-for-its-social-media-post/articleshow/69835890.cms", "description": ""}, "PM Modi": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections-2019/odisha/news/lok-sabha-election-govt-has-taken-measures-to-set-up-chowkidar-in-space-pm-modi-in-odisha/articleshow/68627439.cms", "description": "JEYPORE: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said his government had taken measures to set up a 'chowkidar' in space and asked people to vote for a government that can take concrete decisions and not just raise slogans.

The complainants said they have pleaded with MCG officials to take immediate action against the encroachers, before the green zone turned into an illegal vending zone. MCG officials acknowledged that the encroachments have not only destroyed the green space, but also deprived pedestrians of space. Roadside parking is another problem, which they said causes huge traffic jams on the stretch during peak hours.

Under this pilot scheme, the government initially kept the target of diversifying 50,000 hectares of paddy in particular selected blocks of seven districts including Ambala, Jind, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Sonipat, and Yamunanagar and kept June 15 as the last date of registration for farmers. But after noticing the scheme received a lukewarm response up to June 15, from the particularly selected areas, the agriculture department extended the scheme for entire areas in the above-mentioned seven districts along with extending the date up to June 24. Now, since the area has been extended, the agriculture officials claim that their registration targets of covering 50,000 hectares under maize will be completed within the allotted period of time. The farmers who are registering under this scheme want the government to fulfill its promise and procure the production of maize, soybean and arhar on the minimum support price (MSP). Pardeep Meel, Kurukshetra deputy director agriculture (DDA) said, \u201cwe were given a target of registering 7,000 hectares of land under crop diversification scheme, and till June 18, we have registered around 7,200 hectares of land and the figure will jump up till the last date.\u201d Dr Girish Nagpal, Ambala DDA said, \u201cwe have a target of covering 8,000 hectares and till date 4,556 hectares have been registered under crop diversification.\u201d Surender Singh Yadav, Yamunanagar DDA said, \u201cOur target is covering 3,000 hectares as the rainfall graph of the district is higher as compared to other areas and we have a large flood-prone agricultural area along the banks of Yamuna river.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan. He will be canvassing for candidates of all the Mahagathbandhan constituents \u2014 RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP. Thus, he will be addressing three to four election meetings every day,\u201d Tejashwi\u2019s political adviser Sanjay Yadav told TOI on Monday. Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Multi-storey buildings and residential colonies were built in the sector over a submergence area (flood-prone zone), and licences for these were granted despite warnings of the state\u2019s irrigation department. In several letters written in 2011 (TOI has their copies), to the offices of the district DTCP, deputy commissioner and disaster management department, the Gurugram Water Services Department (irrigation department) had opposed the move to give licences to developers under Master Plan 2025 in the sector. The department had said the state will be responsible for any loss of life or property in case of flood, as the site lay in submergence area of Ghata bund. In the Master Plan 2025, drafted during 2009-2011, DTCP had proposed shifting the alignment of the 28km-long Badshapur drain. It had also started issuing licences to private developers. Over the years, about a dozen multi-storey buildings have come up on plots allotted then, along with some hotels and schools. Over 1,000 families live there now. \u201cThe (building) plan and license (to builders) have been approved by your department, overlooking the importance of storage of water in Ghata bund. In the event of flood, the entrance of flood water in the multi-storeyed flats of Sector 58 cannot (be) avoided as the slope is towards Ghata bund,\u201d states a letter, whose copy is with TOI, sent by the irrigation department to the the district town planner. The irrigation department also sent a notice to the DTP, asking for removal of obstruction to natural flow of flood water to Ghata bund. \u201cIf there is any natural calamity beyond the control of human beings, disaster can\u2019t be avoided and you cannot ignore the factor for the safety of human beings/property. Since private builders, after developing flats/areas, will run away, after that, the liability will fall on the state, for which your department is solely responsible,\u201d states the notice (a copy is with TOI). Yet, according to a letter written by then Union MoS (environment and forests) Jairam Ramesh, licenses were granted to builders on the basis of environmental clearances given by state environment impact assessment authority, as well as Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), the Sohna tehsildar and the forest department, to establish group housing societies and master roads in Sector 58. \u201cI\u2019d like to draw your attention to the submissions made by the state government before high court, in which it has been categorically mentioned that \u201cNo such natural jheel exists in that area. It is rather a local depression, wherein, sometimes, rainwater accumulates due to construction of a flood protection bund. Such bunds are generally constructed for the protection of village abadis from seasonal floods.\u201d  The state government, however, committed that a detailed survey regarding natural features, etc. will be undertaken while finalising the detailed layout plan of the area,\u201d said the letter written by Jairam Ramesh to a petitioner, who moved Punjab and Haryana high court against real estate development in the area. However, the detailed survey has still not been carried out by the government. Environmentalist Colonel (retired) S S Oberoi, who received the information through an RTI response, filed a complaint with the Lokpal against the state government for not carrying out the study before granting licenses to builders in Sector 58. \u201cThe issue is all successive governments have been indifferent and anti-environment.

She filed a complaint with police but had never expected to get her phone back. On Monday, she got a call from police asking her to visit the police commissioner office to receive her lost phone. She is not the only one. Across the city, 65 people who had reported losing their mobile phones last year, had their phones tracked down and recovered by police from as far as UP, Bihar, West Bengal and other parts of the country, after months of effort using latest technological tools.  The recovered phones include all leading brands, from iPhone and Samsung to Oppo, OnePlus and Xiaomi. According to police, the total retail value of the recovered phones is around Rs 10 lakh. This was first time when large numbers of phones were traced and returned to owners. Not surprisingly, the owners were overwhelmed to find out that cops had such a service. \u201cMy husband and I had never thought we\u2019d find the phone again. It\u2019s great to get it back. Knowing that cops put in so much effort was a true surprise,\u201d said Sakshi Midda, who received her Samsung phone she had lost last year. Every day, around 100-120 cases of lost/snatched phones are registered at different police stations of the city. Most remain untraced, for multiple reasons \u2014 lack of technological know-how that can be used to track them down, besides serious crimes that keep the understaffed force busy. Police commissioner Muhammad Akil said different police teams were involved in tracking these phones, adding that they are now trying to set up a special team just for tracking lost and stolen phones. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to hand over recovered phones to people every week,\u201d said Akil. Without elaborating on the methods used, he added the amount of effort needed to recover phones can be understood from the fact that on an average, it took five days for police of two states to recover one particular phone. \u201cThe thief had hidden the phone in a box of grain,\u201d said Akil, adding they can\u2019t reveal more about the probe, but stressed that the investigation involved a lot of technical know-how. Elaborating on why police took so much effort to track phones, the police chief said though mobile phones are small items, owners treat them as treasures.  \u201cToday, mobile phones carry all kind of data, including banking details and passwords, personal photographs, videos and even secrets,\u201d said Akil. He said he has directed the cyber cell of Gurugram police to track all lost mobile phones as soon as complaints are registered. \u201cThis is a small initiative, but it\u2019s expected to provide relief to a large number of people,\u201d said Akil.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

With his arrest, six members \u2014 Advani, Amjad, Amitabh, Zullu, Istak and now Irshad \u2014 of the seven-man gang have now been put behind bars, and cops said they expect ATM theft cases in the city to come down. Of the 33 cases of ATM theft, loot and snatching against Irshad, 29 are registered at different police stations in Gurugram. Police had announced a Rs 50,000 reward for his arrest. According to police, Shahid Polo is the only gang member at large, that he is on the run and that they are hoping to arrest him soon. The gang has executed a series of ATM thefts in Gurugram and adjoining areas between 2012 and 2018. All members are from Kharkhari village in Mewat, and they have a record of attacking police on several occasions, whenever cops tried to arrest them from their homes. Irshad was arrested by police in connection with an ATM theft in Wazirabad. The case was registered at Sector 53 police station on May 7, and handed over to crime unit of Sector 31. Acting on information, police arrested Irshad from Sohna on Monday. He was produced before court on Tuesday and sent to five-day police custody. \u201cHe has been in jail thrice before, and was declared a \u201cproclaimed offender\u201d by court in three cases,\u201d said ACP (crime) Shamsher Singh, adding they are hoping to extract more information during Irshad\u2019s interrogation. The gang specialises in ATM thefts, targeting unmanned ATMs in Gurugram. Police said they used to come to Gurugram in a stolen pick-up van after dark. On reaching their pre-decided target, they would tie the ATM machine with a belt fixed to the pickup van and uproot the machine. They would then load it on the van and drive to an isolated spot, where they would cut open the machine with gas cutter, steal the cash and dump the machine in a lake or pond.

The accused posed as employees of Maruti Suzuki, Prasar Bharti and other organisations to cheat people. Police has recovered fake cheques issued in the name of different organisations and fake identity cards of the companies from their possession. Their modus operandi was unique. They impersonated senior officials of Maruti Suzuki India Private Limited and approached owners of big farmhouses, banquet halls and event management firms to strike a deal with them in the name of organising some mega event for the company. They gave account payee cheques of the company and asked for cash commission from the clients for bringing them such big businesses, after which, they would disappear and change their mobile numbers. Commissioner of police Muhammad Akil said, \u201cSo far, they have admitted to having cheated 35 clients this way. We\u2019re hoping to get more details during interrogation.\u201d He added cops have recovered fake cheques, agreements and identity cards from their possession. He also said police is probing the account linked to these cheques, and how the cheats managed to open it. Akil also said the cheats were held in connection with a case of cheating, forgery and impersonation, registered at Manesar police station on June 13, following a complaint by a Shyam Veer Singh, resident of Kalkaji in Delhi, who owns A to Z Tent Decorator and Catering Company. In the line of work, Shyam had met a Vijay Kumar on February 28, 2018, at a mall in Manesar. Kumar offered to help Singh land a big contract. He introduced Singh to Kuldeep Singh, who identified himself as a senior Maruti official. Kuldeep presented Shyam with an account payee check of Rs 39.39 lakh, and a contract letter from Maruti, for organising a big company event in Manesar, and asked for 10% commission, of which he asked Shyam to pay 5% in cash as advance and the remainder after the event. Shyam paid Kuldeep Rs 1.75 lakh. On March 9, 2018 they again met at the same place. This time, Kuldeep gave Shyam a contract letter from Maruti Suzuki India Private Limited and told him the company would inform him of date and venue of event. When complainant deposited the cheque in his bank, it was rejected because \u201cthere was no such bank account\u201d. A worried Shyam tried to contact Vijay and Kuldeep, but both their mobile phones were switched off. He approached Maruti, where he found out that none of the people work with the company. Finally approached police a few months back, and a case was registered last week. Sector 31 crime unit arrested two persons in June 14 in connection with this case from Dhanchiri Tourist Complex near Sirhaul toll plaza. The accused were identified as Vijay Kumar Jha from Bihar\u2019s Darbhanga and Kuldeep Singh from Amritsar. Police recovered four fake bank cheques in the name of different companies from their possession. One cheque, of Rs 84.81 lakh, was issued in the name of a Nirankari event, another (Rs 53.32 lakh) was issued in the name of Chawla Tent House, Panipat. A third cheque was issued in the name of Subhash Tent House for Rs 89.92 lakh. The fourth one was in the name of A to Z Tent House of New Delhi, for Rs 39.39 lakh.

Singh was on an inspection round to take stock of the city\u2019s monsoon preparedness. Earlier this month, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri had directed NHAI and GMDA officials to expedite work on desilting and cleaning drains and roads of garbage, among others, to avoid waterlogging. He directed that special attention be paid to critical points like Signature Towers crossing, Hero Honda Chowk, Subhash Chowk and U-turn near Ambience mall. On the other hand, a visit to several spots aross the city by TOI belied these efforts. Clogged drains, garbage accumulated along the roadside and potholes were visible in many areas. Sectors 34, 37 and 10A, Sheetla Mata Mandir road and areas in and around Hero Honda Chowk are some areas susceptible to flooding even during light showers. Residents of these areas complained of clogged drains, garbage littered everywhere, and construction and demolition waste dumped openly on the roadside. They expressed concerns over the administration\u2019s efforts in ensuring that potholes are repaired, drains are cleaned and garbage is picked up and properly disposed of. \u201cGarbage dumped in the area isn\u2019t managed on time here. Construction waste is dumped along the road and lies unaddressed. Every year, this garbage flows to the drains and chokes them during rains and causes waterlogging. People are forced to travel on roads flooded with sewage,\u201d complained Hariram, a resident of Khandsa village in Sector 37. Residents are also worried that with the expansion of Badshapur drain still incomplete and some drains broken due to construction work on Sohna road, the upcoming monsoon might cause heavy waterlogging.  District administration officials, however, said they have assured the chief minister that the widening of Badshapur drain will be completed by June 30. Speaking on their efforts to contain waterlogging and ensure smooth traffic flow on roads, an NHAI official claimed, \u201cAll the departments are coordinating with each other to mitigate this challenge. NHAI has already cleaned several surface drains, and the remaining will be cleaned in the coming days. We\u2019ve also doubled the capacity of the suction pumps installed at Hero Honda Chowk to deal with waterlogging.\u201d The official added that while the department is doing its bit, people too need to be more careful about dumping waste. \u201cAreas falling in wards 24 and 27 are bit of a problem. Haphazard waste dumping is rampant in these areas, which puts pressure on the administration. Area councillors should also rise up to the occasion and counsel people towards better waste disposal practices,\u201d he said. GMDA official too said they are gearing up for the monsoon. \u201cWe\u2019ve already cleaned and repaired around 40km of drains in the city to ensure that they don\u2019t clog during rains. Work to cover other drains is underway. We are committed to complete our task before monsoon,\u201d a GMDA official claimed.

Giving credit to party supporters, the former MP said that after Rae Bareli, he got best vote share in Rohtak on account of the hard work of party workers and supporters. Taking on the state\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government led by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, he said that days are numbered of those who played the politics of lies and division in the society for their political gains.

Responding to BJP minister Manish Grover\u2019s claim that they would defeat former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Deepender said that the minister should refrain from speaking such language, as no force in this world could wipe Hooda father-son from people\u2019s heart.

The senior town planner (STP) of Gurugram has recommended the cancellation of the occupation certificate (OC) of the mall to the director of DTCP following a complaint filed at the CM\u2019s Window. If this happens, this will be first time the OC of such a big and operational commercial building is cancelled in Gurugram. The developer did not respond to calls and messages from this correspondent. In April 2017, Delhi resident Reena Joon had filed a complaint highlighting illegal construction in the mall. In her complaint, Joon said she had bought a shop on the ground floor of the mall. \u201cMy shop was on upper ground floor, but the developer (Ardee) made changes in the building after getting OC and now my shop is on the first floor,\u201d she alleged. Taking cognisance of the complaint, the DTCP director had directed the Gurugram STP to submit a report after investigating the allegations. STP Sudhir Chouhan, DTP (planning) RS Batth and DTP (enforcement) Ved Prakash Shehrawat inspected the mall and submitted their report last week. It highlighted that several violations of building plan were found at the mall and recommended that the OC be cancelled till the developer restores the mall as per the approved building plan. Till the unauthorised construction was removed, the report recommended sealing the mall. \u201cDuring the inspection, we found several violations. We\u2019ve sent our report to the DTCP director with the recommended for cancellation of OC of the mall and multiplex. The no-objection certificate (NOC) of multiplex has been revoked.

During the inspection, it was found that no approval had been granted for the construction of a multiplex on the third floor of the mall in the original building plan. According to the report, Ardee has violated the approved building plan and made illegal and unauthorised construction \u2014 a store room in the lower basement and a fan room and store room in the upper basement. Moreover, changes had been made in the plan on the lower ground, upper ground, ground, first and second floors. The report further mentioned that the developer is still making additional construction and is a continuous offender by neither abiding by the rules of the department nor maintaining the sanctity of the approved building plan.

Colonies like Noble Farms, Sadhguru Farms and parts of Ashok Vihar and Dharam colony, which fall within the 300m restricted area, are the worst hit. Though the Punjab and Haryana high court has given its nod for temporary power and water connections to residents of the area until the legality of the colonies is decided, residents here still depend on water tankers and groundwater. While they have demanded that the MCG provide them with water supply, the corporation maintains that connections can't be given as the matter is sub-judice. Residents claimed that in spite of filing petitions in the court to seek temporary services like power and water supply until the final orders on the structures raised in the area are dispensed, their pleas have fell on deaf ears. While their collective efforts did help them avail temporary power connections, water supply remains a distant luxury for many, they said. In the absence of proper supply, residents are either relying on private water tankers or submersible pumps to draw groundwater. The overuse of such pumps has contributed to the deteriorating groundwater situation in the city. According to the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA), Gurugram is overdrawing its groundwater supply by 300%. As a result, the water table had fallen by 33m in 2014, and the table is receding by 1m every year. Commenting on the existing water supply situation in the area, an MCG official said, \u201cWe can\u2019t provide water to households within 300m of the IAF depot as the matter is in court and the structures here have been deemed illegal.\u201d The official further noted that the department has laid down water pipelines in certain pockets that are over and above the 300m range, and the remaining work will completed in coming few months. Removing structures from the area has become one of the biggest infrastructural challenges of the district administration. The legitimacy of the houses and shops within 900m of the depot has been contested in court for years. In 2015, the Centre had told the high court that the restricted zone around the depot had been decreased from 900m to 300m. The court had further asked the district administration to ensure that no new structure is raised in the area. However, residents have claimed that several paying guest accommodations, shops and residential structures have come up in the area even after court orders. Meanwhile, MCG officials have claimed that their demolition drives have faced severe resistance from the inhabitants.

The stigma attached to conditions such as depression or anxiety is all too real in India, leaving sufferers despairing of a way out of the darkness. This is where support networks come in, with the offer of a patient and empathetic ear, and (just maybe) the promise of future emotional well-being. Finally, it seems, there\u2019s a window for those who struggle to see the light. Sakshi Virmani reports Hawkers and peddlers swarm the Georgian colonnades of Connaught Place on a busy Sunday evening. Inside Central Park, a group of 15 youngsters huddle together on the dew-drenched grass, unmindful of ardent lovebirds playing peekaboo around them. The session gets underway with an activity in which members are asked to identify a nearby object, something they can relate to. A bespectacled boy picks a bench, someone else chooses a defunct traffic light. At this Offcause meet-up, each of the 15 is being keenly observed by a psychologist, who is helming the hour-long group therapy. Here, you can speak freely about your fears, anxieties and traumas, and, also, share tips on how to get by. The idea is to get everyone talking, to make sure nobody feels left out, by providing a sheltered space and an environment that\u2019s non-judgemental, accommodative and creative. Offcause, for example, lends a hand by encouraging men and women to talk candidly, or to take part in activity-based therapy (painting, dance, improv comedy). More than a few come to listen, some seek succour in the shape of suggestions, yet others draw strength from fellow participants who have emerged from the shadows. \u201cAcknowledging the stigma is the first step, and getting yourself out of the house is another \u2013 we self-stigmatise ourselves so much,\u201d claims UK-based Jhilmil Breckenridge, a poet, mental-health activist and founder of Bhor Foundation, an initiative devoted to mental health. Indeed, for the thousands whose days seem perpetually gloomy, an hour or so in the right company might help part the clouds to reveal a ray of sunshine.  LISTENING WITHOUT PREJUDICE Initiatives like Offcause offer a support web for the many overwhelmed by mental health concerns, without the patient having to shell out on a therapist (thus, avoiding the unease of a visit to the psychiatrist). Such collectives comprise individuals whose experiences leave them best suited to help others similarly afflicted. \u201cAfter I got out of depression, I realised it really helps to talk to somebody who is going through similar issues, as it gives them hope,\u201d admits Mridul Trehan, who credits counseling received by the Delhi Depression Support Group for his recovery. Ujala, a 29-year-old from Jammu, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and clinical depression. A regular at Offcause meet-ups, Ujala feels that sharing her experiences can be of immense value to fellow sufferers trying to understand the difference between surface and underlying issues. \u201cPersonally, I am seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist for my PTSD and depression, but I love being a part of Offcause \u2014 to help others going through various mental disorders,\u201d she says. \u201cYou cannot categorise mental illness due to some accident or trigger, it depends on genetics and the way some people\u2019s brains are wired. Some incidents have a ripple effect, they keep playing again and again, which is emotionally consuming,\u201d explains Ujala, who doesn\u2019t just recall incidents, she relives them (like the domestic violence she and her mother have been victims of). For Offcause founder Nikita, it was a causal Instagram update on World Mental Health Day last October that proved the spark. \u201cI asked if people had any stories to share anonymously for the Instagram page I wanted to launch, (and) the response was great \u2013 it was surprising to see my closest friends talking about issues they would have never discussed with me on the rare occasions we would meet,\u201d reveals Nikita, who, having left her job just three months earlier, was somewhat at her wit\u2019s end. So, a page was created and the conversations continued. In less than a month, Offcause had its first informal group therapy session. Since then, it has been hosting meet-ups on the third Saturday of every month in Delhi, Gurgaon and Mumbai.  STRIKING THE RIGHT NOTE At an upmarket gastropub in South Delhi, a group of musicians are sharing a laugh over pints of draught beer. They form part of support group Good Vibration, initially launched to discuss problems affecting young musicians, and anybody associated with the industry. Now, anyone can join in, in the monthly meets. Founder Rithika Nayan, a music teacher and certified life coach, commences by talking about anxiety. Soon, the discussion touches on panic attacks, and how best to deal with them. \u201cScream!\u201d suggests one. \u201cTake a nap!\u201d recommends another, a quick-fix that has everyone nodding in unison. \u201cWe millennials are looking for external validation all the time. Blowing things out of proportion in our heads, overthinking and suppressing emotions leads to extreme outbursts. We are never taught how to deal with our emotions intelligently,\u201d explains Rithika to an audience of 12, all absorbed. \u201cKeeping a gratitude journal really helps \u2014 counting the small blessings makes a difference,\u201d she offers. According to a 2015-16 survey by Bangalore-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), 13.7% of India\u2019s general population suffers from a mental ailment. While 150 million Indians are in urgent need of mental health intervention, only 30 million have access to such care. And, according to WHO (World Health Organisation) projections, by 2020 approximately 20% of Indians would be beset by some form of mental illness. Yet, to many in India, mental health still comes with plenty of baggage, and potential loss of face in front of peers. The older generation is reluctant to talk about it and the young think it\u2019s a fad, believes psychologist Dr Ritu Dangwal. She advocates an organised support network. \u201cSupport groups are essentially reassurance and reinforcements, more like stopgap arrangements. The groups need to realise that if a person needs extra help, they must guide them to psychiatrists,\u201d she insists. \u201cIn India, poor people don\u2019t have the bandwidth to access even basic medical care. But it is heartening to know at least the younger generation is reaching out and saying it\u2019s okay to talk about it.\u201d Dr Dangwal does, however, advise caution. \u201cThe tricky part is when everyone starts giving advice. It\u2019s encouraging to have support groups but only to a point \u2014 they can address problems at the surface.\u201d  CARE FOR THE CAREGIVERS On a Saturday afternoon last month, a support group of caregivers assembled to discuss family and relationships at Khoj Studios, in the bylanes of Delhi\u2019s Khirki Extension. The Listening Circles provide solace and support not just for those undergoing mental distress, but also for their caregivers, who could be a spouse, parents or children. This support network is moderated by Namarita Kathait, a commissioning editor with a publishing house, and Jhilmil Breckenridge. \u201cWe wanted to start a support group that is non-hierarchal, and to get people together in a safe space to have a discourse on mental health,\u201d tells Namarita, 25, who inadvertently became a caregiver for her mother when she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. \u201cI was labelled as the sad girl in school because I did not know how to express what I was going through,\u201d she says, speaking for the many who choose to remain silent. For Jhilmil, it\u2019s important that guidance or advice is not pushed against anyone\u2019s wishes. \u201cPeople are already vulnerable, we don\u2019t want to force things like meditation and spirituality on them,\u201d she stresses. The next step, says Namarita, is to build \u2018listening circles\u2019 with those who have attended the sessions, and to create support groups in their own localities, in colleges and hostels, and among the wider community. \u201cOur ethos is very clear \u2013 we are here to listen and we keep it as liberal as possible,\u201d she maintains. \u201cPeople have the right to speak and not speak, to walk in at any point they want.\u201d  YOU\u2019RE NOT ALONE Then there are youngsters striving to cope with parents who have been diagnosed with a mental illness. It\u2019s this bracket that an upcoming support group network is looking to rally around. Behind the group is Divya Dureja, a counseling psychologist, LGBT activist and TEDx speaker. \u201cIf your parent experiences mental illness, it is normal for you to have all kinds of different feelings,\u201d she reasons. \u201cYou might not understand why your parents act the way they do. It might be hard to know how to understand your parent, or what to do for them.\u201d Divya believes volunteer caregivers need to be empowered as a first line of defence. \u201cI\u2019ve been building frameworks of mental health support groups that don\u2019t seem to exist in our country,\u201d she explained. \u201cOver the past year, I\u2019ve interacted with over 400 students, primarily studying psychology, at panels, summits and workshops, and (also) those individuals who are looking for resources that are empowering to their mental health.\u201d For, psychological well-being is as critical for the ones who deliver care as for those who receive it. And sanctuary can also be found online. On It\u2019s Ok To Talk, the young can share their innermost thoughts through blogs, poetry, video stories, artwork, even audio recordings. But not only the young. Among the personal accounts on the website is a 58-year-old Gurgaon man\u2019s cry from the heart: \u2018Today my heart is brimming painfully with hurt feelings and emotions and there is no one here to share these feelings with or to have a shoulder to cry on little\u2026 I have been facing problems linked with depression, schizophrenia and what not since ages now \u2013 and with me all my family too\u2026\u2019 Proof that age doesn\u2019t discriminate against the despondent of spirit. It\u2019s Ok To Talk reaches out via digital, social media and on-ground activities, which could include public talks, arts-based events and youth leadership programmes. \u201cAnyone can share stories, of lived experiences of mental health and well-being, and the same will have a tremendous impact on those who may be struggling themselves, and help them realise that they are not alone,\u201d informs Sweta Pal, a member of the Delhi team. \u201cBy sharing your own story, you can help inspire other young people that mental health does not need to be shrouded in silence, and it\u2019s ok to talk about it.\u201d Happily, it is becoming easier to talk about mental health, aided by get-togethers that are informal and intimate. And while the fragmented nature of the space means there will always be patients who slip through the cracks, still folks are turning to a growing number of support networks, offering as these do more than a glimmer of hope to the unmoored, the lonely and the vulnerable of India.

Police said the woman is a student of software engineering and had come to India for a year-long internship with an Indian IT major. She had taken up accommodation in Gurgaon and was looking to shift homes when, on a Facebook group, she came across the suspect, a man police identified as Aanjaney. Investigators said he was 36 years old, worked in a production house making animation films, and is an original resident of Anand Vihar in Delhi but was currently living in Gurgaon. Police arrested Aanjaney on Saturday. He was charged him under sections 376 (rape) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC at DLF-1 police station. She said no to sex, he forced himself on herIn her complaint, filed with the help of a friend who acted as a translator, the Spanish woman said Aanjaney had invited her to his house in DLF-1for a party on June 14 and she had reached around 10.30pm. She told cops she trusted him enough to go to his place. \u201cAfter a few hours we started kissing, and we went upstairs to his room. But I did not feel comfortable with the idea of having sex, so I asked him to stop. He then asked me to spend at least the night there, and I agreed,\u201d she said in her complaint. She claimed she had fallen asleep but woken up a while later and found Aanjaney was still in the room and was masturbating looking at her. \u201cI felt very uncomfortable so I decided to return my house but he didn\u2019t let me. I clearly said I was uncomfortable, I didn\u2019t want to have sex but he forced me to stay and raped me. I had to go through the humiliation because I was afraid if I did not do what he asked, it would get worse. He closed the main door, threw my phone away, and forced himself on me,\u201d she alleged. Police said they were first informed about the alleged sexual assault through a phone call to the control room around 9am on Saturday. The Spanish woman came across Aanjaney only on June 12 during her house hunt, investigators said. They hit it off well, so when he called her to the party, she agreed. \u201cI saw a post from Aanjaney offering a room and we got in touch for that,\u201d she said in her complaint. Police said the she was taken for a medical test and her statement was subsequently recorded at a city court. Police said Aanjaney works in an Udyog Viharbased company. He was single and has been living in the DLF-1 bungalow, which they had rented, since January this year with three friends. Ved Prakash, SHO of DLF-1 police station, said, \u201cAltogether, five persons, including the accused and the Spanish woman, were present at the party. The accused invited two friends and one of his housemates. The housemate went to sleep some time later and the two friends went home. When everybody left, he took her to his room and raped her. On Saturday morning, the Spanish woman called a friend who stays in Sector 10, booked a cab and went to her place. They came back together to file the complaint.\u201d Karan Goyal, ACP (DLF), said the accused had admitted to his crime during questioning and would be taken to court for a decision on his custody.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar.

In the past two months, 381 instances of traffic congestion have been reported from these areas, revealed the cumulative data compiled by the department. That includes 197 instances of traffic jams from the 22 spots in April, and 184 instances from 15 areas in May. Closer analysis of the data reveals most instances of traffic congestion have been reported from seven spots, namely, Sirhaul toll plaza, Signature Towers, Sheetla Mata mandir road, Ghata mod, Atlas FoB, Daultabad flyover and Tikri cut, which accounted for about 60% of the total number of jams. Of these, Sirhual toll recorded the maximum number of congestions, 47, followed closely by Signature Towers with 43 and 33 at Ghata mod. The data also reveals that duration of these jams range from 1.5 minutes to 5 hours. The longest congestion for the two months was in Sirhaul toll. The spot witnessed a 5-hour-long jam in April, as well as a two-hour-long jam in May. Following Sirhaul in the list, Atlas FoB and Ghata mod recorded long jams of about 50 minutes to an hour each. Commenting on Sirhaul, DCP (traffic) Himanshu Garg told TOI, \u201cSirhaul is the most challenging area due to a huge bottleneck. About 21 lanes on the Gurugram side converge into 4 lanes on the Delhi side, leading to heavy congestion.\u201d He added that the data reports and subsequent inspections of the area by senior officials, including himself, has helped address a lot of challenges, like fixing of a sharp turn at Dwarka link road. Gurugram\u2019s vulnerability to perennial traffic snarls is one thing that unites all denizens of Millennium City, which is otherwise is a city of contradictions. Be it commuters from neighbouring cities or residents, the congestion affects all. As a result, traffic cops and their efforts are always under scanner. To find a lasting solution, traffic police resorted to gathering and analysing data earlier this year. The department claimed not only does the exercise help them keep a track on major congestion spots, so that they can deploy force to ease traffic flow, but also help them devise policy and carry out enforcement drives. The department records data daily, which is complied as monthly reports that act as a good reference point for the department. \u201cThrough these reports, we identify priority areas and devise strategy to manage traffic flow, from spots that need deployment of additional forces or barricades, to cuts in the media that need to be opened or closed, etc. Based on these reports, our officials visit key areas to figure root causes of problems.

This sums up a visitor\u2019s experience of the city\u2019s arterial link \u2014 MG Road. With numerous malls, residential apartments, public and private offices along it, the road is forever jam-packed with commuters, especially during peak hours. The volume of traffic can be gauged from the presence of two of the city\u2019s main metro stations here \u2014 MG Road and Sikanderpur \u2014 used daily by lakhs of officegoers from the city and its NCR neighbours. The administration has made many commitments in the past towards maintaining and beautifying the stretch. Last year, many master roads in the city, including MG Road, were transferred to GMDA. In December 2018, the department had announced that it would conduct repair and maintenance work on 12 stretches by March. However, TOI\u2019s visit revealed that six months later, MG Road is still in a bad shape. Apart from the poor condition of the surface, chronic traffic jams during peak office hours, often due to wrong-side driving that broken dividers and illegal parking seem to encourage, make commute a harrowing experience on this road. Commenting on the GMDA\u2019s efforts to address the challenges posed by this stretch, an official revealed the department is rolling out a Rs 11-crore project to upgrade it. \u201cThe tender has been allotted to a private firm that will repair this stretch \u2014 from Mehrauli-Gurugram Road to IFFCO Chowk, via Sikanderpur road \u2014 by layering bitumen all over. The contractor will also be liable for its maintenance for three years from the time work is completed,\u201d the official said. He further pointed out that while earlier repair work on this stretch came under the department\u2019s annual maintenance, the current project is listed as a special repair work. The 15m-green belt on either side is also in a deplorable state, with garbage, including C&D waste, littered on it and spilling over on the road. Commuters fear if the administration doesn\u2019t take prompt action, this could spell doom in the monsoons. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we even call this a green belt. Fences lie broken, garbage is littered on it with no one to clean that. It\u2019s as if the administration will wake up only during monsoon when garbage floods the road and chokes the drains,\u201d said Nirmit, a commuter from Delhi.
