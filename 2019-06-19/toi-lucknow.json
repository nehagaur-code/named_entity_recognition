Against daily requirement of 400 units, the current availability of A+ is 40 units and AB+ just 10 units. Even the donation of over 100 units on the World Blood Donor Day did not ease the situation as only a few units of these two blood groups were received at KGMU. The shortage is creating problems not only for general patients but also for thalassemia patients as they require regular blood transfusions. In wake of the crisis, only one unit of blood group A+ and AB+ per patient is being issued daily from the bank. There are 100 registered thalassemia patients at KGMU and in all they require 125 units of blood for transfusion in every three to four weeks. Sixty of these patients belong to these two blood groups. For thalassemia patients, KGMC issues blood units even without donors. Prof Tulika Chandra, head of the transfusion medicine department, said, \"On a single day, we give out 100 units of A+ and AB+ blood groups.

This has upset power employees who say this will invite strong protest. In a note to all states, including UP, the Niti Aayog has said distribution companies may adopt a franchisee model for retail business in rural areas and stipulate minimum performance parameters, including the use of decentralised generation sources and storage systems for local reliability and resilience. The recommendations come at a time the UP government is grappling with line losses, particularly arising out of power thefts, to the tune of 25-30% against an expected 15%. As of now, only Agra and Noida have entrusted private companies with power distribution. While Torrent does the job in Agra, NPCL works in Noida. Implementation of the Niti Aayog recommendation will mean that power distribution of other discoms such as Madhyanchal, Paschimanchal, Dakshinanchal, Poorvanchal and Kesco will rest with private companies, who will not only maintain infrastructure but also generate electricity bills for consumers. Energy minister Srikant Sharma told TOI the state government would review the recommendation before taking any further step. \u201cThe objective is to improve the power distribution system and the government is working in that direction,\u201d he said. The development, nevertheless, has sent power employees into a tizzy. President of All India Power Engineers Federation Shailendra Dubey said any move to privatise distribution would invite strong protests. \u201cAttempts have failed in the past 25 years. The energy department should initiate talks with power employees before taking another drastic decision. The aim should be to provide better and cheap power to consumers,\u201d Dubey said. The federation plans to write to Union power minister RK Singh on the issue. The idea to privatise power distribution was first mooted under the Mayawati government in 2009, after which Agra was handed over to Torrent. The Akhilesh Yadav government came up with a similar plan for Kanpur, but the move was thwarted by power employee protests. Among its other important recommendations, the Niti Aayog has suggested performance-based incentive in the tariff structure. It has said that to manage the demand for power, it is necessary to introduce 100% metering, use of smart meters and metering of electricity supplied to agriculture.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

In such a scenario, CCTV cameras and quick response by police can act as deterrents. In case of arrest, evidence in the form of footage will help speed up investigation. Severe punishment should follow, especially for repeat offenders.A police dossier has listed 255 cases of chain and cash snatching in the city since January, which effectively means one person is being targeted every 15 hours. Worse, very few of the these cases have been cracked till date in the absence of effective electronic surveillance. Indiranagar and Gomtinagar top the list of unsafe neighbourhoods with a total of 49 cases followed by Aliganj with 11. The victims were mostly morning walkers, besides working women returning home late from office. In some cases, the accused used firearms to rob their victims of valuables. On May 29, two bikers tried to rob Urmila Devi of her gold chain at gunpoint in B Block, Indiranagar. She managed to retain half of the chain. Shikha Tiwari of Mahanagar recalled the horror of June 3 when two men flashed a pistol and snatched her gold chain in broad daylight. There were no patrol teams or CCTV cameras to nail them, Tiwari said. On June 8, Rekha Shah was robbed of her gold chain right in front of a police outpost in Talkatora. It was early morning. Her husband was teaching her how to ride a scooter. There were no policemen who could come to their rescue, she recalled. Not just women, snatch gangs have targeted men too in the recent past. On June 7, Ayush Jaiswal was robbed of his wallet by two men on a bike near Bhoothnath market. He says police have done precious little to identify the culprits, let alone arrest them. Sangeeta Agarwal of Mahanagar is still afraid to go out alone. On June 11, two men on a bike snatched her chain near Gole market when she was out to buy milk. \u201cI have stopped venturing out alone since that day.

The three government hospitals whose doctors joined the stir are Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), King George's Medical University (KGMU) and Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS). With resident doctors striking work, the government hospital failed to admit any new patient, leaving senior doctors to attend to old patients only in the OPD. The situation in various private hospitals was worse where even the OPD remained non-operational. Patients, some of them in serious conditions, were seen waiting outside various government and private hospitals, making fervent pleas to the medical staffers to attend to their problems. SGPGIMS chief medical superintendent Amit Agarwal said some 150 doctors of the institute were on strike due to which no operation was performed or new patients admitted. \"Though new patients are not being admitted, senior doctors are attending to the ones already admitted in the hospital,\" said Dr Agarwal. KGMU spokesperson Sudhir Singh, however, claimed the work was only partially affected in the hospital, which has a strength of 575 resident doctors. Claiming that some resident doctors were working in some departments, Singh said 3,580 patients were attended to in the OPD, while 104 new patients were admitted and 22 operations performed. Similar conditions prevailed in the Lohia Hosptial. IMA Lucknow unit president G P Singh, meanwhile, said besides the resident doctors, some 4,000 private doctors struck work in private hospitals, nursing homes and clinics. Only emergency patients were being treated in private hospitals, Dr Singh said, adding hundreds of doctors held a protest at the IMA office here and demanded security for themselves. Balrampur Hospital director Rajiv Lochan said the patient flow has gone up by 35 to 40 per cent following the strike in other hospitals. Dr Lochan, however, claimed that medical services were going on as routine as there were no resident doctors there. Reports from Jhansi, Meerut, Gorakhpur and Varanasi said the strike call evoked a mixed response.

The protesters were all scheduled caste, demanding action against their gram pradhan for providing water supply only to the village area inhabited by upper castes and not giving them any. \u201cWe are forced to walk to the handpump across our village, crossing a highway for it. When we cannot go to fill water, our children do. It is highly dangerous for them. The pradhan has diverted all the water to the area where upper caste people live. We are unable to do daily wage work because we have to get water,\u201d said Savitri, a resident. Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Bundelkhand district, one of the most backward in country, has a perennial problem of water scarcity, but the situation is worse this year. In 2018, the region saw rainfall deficiency ranging from 8% to 56%. This year, with monsoon already delayed, the rainfall deficiency between June 1 and June 18 is already being pegged from 26% to 84%. Ponds and wells have dried up and locals have to walk an hour to fetch water. The livestock is worst affected as carcasses are seen lining roads and lying scattered in fields. In the absence of jobs, failing agriculture and water shortage, most people have left for cities for temporary employment and will return to sow their fields when monsoon arrives. In Dhikwaha village of Mahoba district, 18-20 tubewells have gone dry. Princy Yadav (14) tells she has to walk an hour to the only tubewell outside the village to get water. \u201cAround 125 people from our village have gone to cities because there is neither water nor any work here. The women of the households go to fetch water in the morning, and in the evening, it\u2019s the turn of children after they return from school,\u201d she says. It takes 30 minutes to reach the tubewell, but well over two hours are actually spent in returning with water because there is a long queue at the tubewell. \u201cThere are frequent fights, as the tubewell often runs out of water and so all the people want to fill their vessels first,\u201d she said. In Dhoraiyan, residents say that 15 families left the village with the onset of summer and will return only after first monsoon rain. \u201cMonsoon had failed last year,\u201d says Pushpa, a resident. \u201cIt is delayed this time also because of which agriculture has been seriously affected. The fields are dry and there is no fodder for cattle. The wells and tubewells dried up months back. The government doesn\u2019t send any water tankers,\u201d she added. Mahoba recorded a rainfall deficit of 56% in 2018 where Banda was 8% rain deficient. This year, the pre-monsoon deficit is already 29% and 84%, respectively, with no rains yet to recharge wells and village ponds.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

Complete with 4D effects, the 30-minute show will play on loop for four hours every evening in front of the memorial museum. \u201cThe sound and light show will take people back in time when the siege happened inside the Residency premises. The show had been withdrawn after 2010 because we had not been able to get mandatory approval from the ASI headquarters in Delhi. This year, all formalities have been completed. On August 15 and thereafter, Lucknow will witness history and the role of Awadh in it,\u201d said PK Singh, joint director of UP tourism. \u201cThe need to revive the sound and light show was felt because it helps today\u2019s generation understand the significance of historical monuments,\u201d Singh added. While a Mumbai-based digital company has been roped in for the production, a proposal has been sent to Big B to lend his baritone voice to the show. An official confirmation from the actor is awaited, but sources have said he is unlikely to turn down the offer.

A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital.

Even if you have scored as low as five marks in the Lucknow University management entrance test, you stand a chance of getting admission to the course. LU has invited all candidates who have appeared for the entrance test for admission to its management courses for counselling on Tuesday. A candidate scoring marks even in single digit in the entrance test is likely to get admission. This is because for admission to 600 MBA seats, only 742 candidates had appeared for the entrance test. Besides, a number of candidates did not turn up for counselling. As a result, low scorers are likely to get an opportunity for admission as the difference between the total number of seats and the number of candidates is very low. LU offers six management courses. While there is maximum rush for regular MBA, seats in other courses\u2014MBA (finance & control), MBA (human resources & industrial relations), MBA (marketing), MBA (international business) and master\u2019s in tourism and total management, often remain vacant.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat.
