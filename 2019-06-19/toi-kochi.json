The fans started cheering the actor as soon as he entered along with the CM. The uproar continued even as the CM started addressing the gathering. A visibly irked Vijayan said, \u201cThose who are cheering the actor lives in their own world. They do not know any other things. This may be because they are immature. But they are not doing a service to the actor either.\u201d Before concluding his speech, the chief minister said, \u201cConsidering the progress the state has achieved, it does not have enough specialized medical facilities. We (the government) have been requesting the central government to sanction an All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) for long, to meet the increasing demands in Kerala.\u201d He added that he had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Saturday and urged him to accord the sanction for AIIMS in Kerala. \u201cThe Central government is expected to consider Kerala\u2019s demand,\u201d the CM said. He also added that the opening of Avitis Institute of Medical Sciences with super specialty departments in cardiology, neurology, nephrology, gastroenteritis, renal science etc, was a big step forward in the health sector in the state.

A stay was issued by the court after considering petitions challenging implementation of the report of a three-member committee headed by MA Khader that recommended for a unified directorate of education at the school level and creation of the post of director general of education by unifying the three directorates \u2013 directorate of public instruction, higher secondary directorate, and vocational higher secondary directorate. It was alleged by the petitioners that the government's move would give the charge of principal of higher secondary school to headmaster of high school. As headmasters need not have post graduation and higher secondary school teachers need post graduation, it would result in placing a head master over higher secondary school teachers. Nair Service Society (NSS), which runs many schools in the state, had also questioned implementation of the commission report before the high court. It was alleged by NSS that the orders issued by the government are contrary to Kerala Education Act and its rules as well as provisions of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE) and its rules. The government\u2019s move also hinders the time-tested public education system that has separate administrative setup as well as teaching and non-teaching staff with qualifications befitting the physical and mental growth of children, NSS had contended.

She was one of the 87 performers at the alumni event organised by the Old Students Association (OSA) of the Government Women\u2019s College, Thiruvananthapuram. Titled Vasthrayana, the dance drama themed on the evolution of garments in India was a visual treat for those in attendance at the Karthika Tirunal Auditorium, recently. The cultural extravaganza saw performances of three generations of students, from the previous pre-degree batches to the recent graduates. Hundreds of alumni including homemakers, working professionals, artistes and bureaucrats, joined the performers at the venue to take a stroll down memory lane to relive their campus life. While those who had become great grandmothers enjoyed watching the show, many were looking around for their old batchmates. Though time had changed their physical appearance, many still found their pals, by calling out their nicknames. Singer Kanchana Sreeram, BA Music graduate of the 2017 batch, portrayed a South Indian bride on the show and says the event gave her friendship goals. \u201cAt a time when video calls and group chats are the norm, this alumni group stands apart because the reunion is held regularly without fail. I am happy I could see our super seniors and their seniors still joke around like in their younger days. I think they were the most enthusiast bunch at the event,\u201d she says. \u201cI was also surprised to see the performance of Princess Gouri Parvathi Bhayi, who danced flawlessly.\u201d The dance drama narrated the evolution of garments with time \u2014 from the stone age to contemporary dressing styles. The event was held under the guidance of Pooyam Tirunal Gouri Parvathi Bayi, who is the OSA secretary. \u201cThe show is held every two years. The 87 members who were part of this show were of different ages and from all walks of life. We had grandmothers and mothers alongside granddaughters and daughters. It was hard work but fun too. Our dance director Aswathy Nair worked tirelessly to ensure seamless production and Ambili Ramnath\u2019s expertise with words and Kavalam Sreekumar\u2019s magic with the music have always been the mainstay of our performances,\u201d she says. Apart from performing, for Gouri Parvathi Bayi, it is also an event to meet her friends and teachers. \u201cI have never really left the Women\u2019s College - as a student, teacher and as part of the Alumni association, I have always remained in touch with the institution. For most of us, there is a sense of homecoming when we step into the college compound. The years fall away, and we feel rejuvenated. Ultimately in life, our real earnings are the friendships we have forged, the wonderful experiences nobody can take away from us and precious memories that stay with us always. Many of our older members make it a point to come to our meetings and events. They make a greater physical effort than youngsters who work a full day and have homes to run too,\u201d she adds. Actress Sona Nair was also part of the event, enthralling her friends in her avatar as goddess Saraswati. \u201cThis is an event that I eagerly look forward to. I feel blessed meeting my old teachers and classmates, and giving me memories to cherish for the next two years. Each of the 87 artistes were given a three-and-half-minute performance and so that ensured everyone had equal time to perform,\u201d she says, adding that she always makes it a point to find time amid her shooting schedules to make it to the reunion.

In 2017, agricultural minister V S Sunilkumar has announced a winter vegetable zone in Vattavada and Kanthalloor, including Devikulam block, to make the region as the winter vegetable hub of the state. Sunilkumar had inaugurated over Rs 11 crore worth winter vegetable and fruit production development project in Kanthalloor and Vattavada and promised that the government will boost winter vegetable and fruit production in the area and will develop the centre as the state\u2019s best vegetable production centre. But after the three years, the project has stopped without any benefit to the farmers in the region. A department official said the government might announce another project that is why it is stopping the zone. Vattavada winter vegetable farmers\u2019 society president K Jayaprakash said, \u201cThe farmers in the Kanthalloor and Vattavada regions expected that the winter vegetable zone project will be completed soon. The farmers in the region have not been getting any benefit from the winter vegetable zone project for the last three years.\u201d \u201cThe Vattavada and Kanthalloor regions have a huge potential to produce winter vegetables and fruits.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

As the day progressed, most of them, to whom the acting class was a novelty, were fully engrossed in Beto\u2019s engaging conversations and \u2018games\u2019. The tips and tricks he shared in the class, according to the participants, were not just lessons in acting, but for life.  \u201cI was super-excited to attend the training ever since I read about him. It was truly worth it. I loved the way he communicated ideas and how he explained to us the importance of knowing one\u2019s own body. Being a college lecturer, it is really important to know how to build a connect with my students and how to transform myself by transforming others,\u201d says Lesly Augustine, assistant professor, Sacred Hearts College, Kochi.  Beto Ruiz Beto, who heads the acting department at the Intercultural Theatre Institute (ITI) in Singapore, has found his third home at Kerala. He, together with a few artistes and art enthusiasts, including koodiyattom performer Kapila Venu, has started a collective in Kerala named Across the River to create international productions. The collective aims at bringing together actors from across the world, including from ITI. \u201cWe are creating and devising a new project which is inspired by the works of Arundhati Roy\u2019s God of Small Things and Perumal Murugan\u2019s One Part Woman respectively. We are rehearsing at Irinjalakuda,\u201d says Beto, adding that as an outsider he can view India through new eyes, though he has learnt koodiyattom, kalaripayattu and other art forms of Kerala. \u201cI am focusing more on inter-culturalism with an exchange of ideas, cultures and views with others and seeking people\u2019s responses to the current times. The two books surprised me as I was able to resonate with Mexican social issues while reading it. So, I understood, there is a connection between the two countries; we are not similar, yet we are not totally different.\u201d Talking about the recent workshop, Beto says that he was excited to see that there are so many people at the workshop interested in performing and who aspire to be artistes. \u201cThe exchange I have with experienced actors who attend my workshop is fulfilling. The more I do, the more questions I have, be it from books or the conversations. They make the dialogues fresh and make my life productive and healthy. When freshers walk in, I see less ego, less vanity and more energy. An artiste is at first a human and then an artiste, so it will be always good for anybody to be part of acting classes. I see people who get so inspired for life from the games we play. My aim is to create honest performers,\u201d he says. An expert in Kundalini Yoga, Beto picked theatre as a career when he was 15. After completing an undergraduate course in theatre at Guadalajara, Mexico, Beto went to Singapore as he felt there was a need to preserve the holistic approach traditional theatre brings in, where dancers, singers, musicians and actors work together. So, he studied Asian theatre forms and did a theatre training and research programme in Singapore. His prominent works as a director include operas, such as Verdi\u2019s La Traviata and Purcell\u2019s Dido and Aeneas, and plays such as Dario Fo\u2019s Un Dia Cualquiera and Alfred Jarry\u2019s King Ubu. He has also worked on productions in the US, Colombia and Poland. \u201cI was completely trained in realism, as three decades ago, that was the only practice in Mexico. I felt attracted with the mysteries of our body, so I was also trained in contemporary dancing. Then I began doing physical theatre and dance theatre and started exploring its possibilities. At ITI, I found Michel Chekov\u2019s style interesting and that is what I am now working on. I am also following the idea of interdisciplinary practice, using the body in all its possibilities,\u201d he says, adding that the Across the River collective\u2019s project will feature all these ideas.

Inaction by the voter in getting his name restored also won\u2019t justify such action, the court said. The judgment by Justice Shaji P Chaly came after considering a petition filed by 64-year-old A Subair of Chala in Thiruvananthapuram, questioning the removal of his name from the voters\u2019 list prepared for the Lok Sabha elections this year. Names of his wife and daughter were retained while his was removed on the report of booth level officer that he changed his residence. Referring to Section 22 of the Representation of the People Act of 1950, the court pointed out that the statute says the voter should be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard. The judgment said, \u201cOn an evaluation of the said provisions, it is explicit that, they are peremptory in nature and can never be brushed aside or overlooked. Proviso thereto makes it clear that before removing a person from the voters list, the electoral registration officer is duty bound to give the person concerned a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of the action proposed to be taken. Which thus also means, the action or enquiry contemplated under Sec 22 of the Act, 1950 is not an empty formality, but on the other hand, founded on principles of natural justice, which if violated, action becomes arbitrary and illegal inviting action against the officer concerned.\u201d No opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner in the case, the court added. The Election Commission had contended that the removal from voters\u2019 list was preceded by several steps such as inviting objections to draft electoral roll, including giving publicity to \u2018deleted lists\u2019 and that a final electoral roll was published at the end of a process that lasted over a year. After finding that no opportunity of hearing was granted to the petitioner, the court said, \u201cIt is also apposite to mention that, mere inaction on the part of the petitioner to restore the name removed from the voters list, is not a justification for removing the name, otherwise than in accordance with law.\u201d The court then ordered the chief election commissioner of Kerala to conduct a detailed inquiry into the incident and, if required, take appropriate action against the officers who removed the petitioner\u2019s name from the voters list within two weeks.

A garden close to the lake and a children park will be constructed in Vagamon in the second phase of the tourism project,\u201d Jayan said. \u201cThe new facilities will be inaugurated during the monsoon tourist season. As many as five lakh tourists visited Vagamon in last year. Nearly 1.5 lakh tourists reached Vagamon during the monsoon last year. The heavy tourist inflow shows Vagamon have a vast tourism potential,\u201d Vijayan said. Para gliding, pine plantation, evergreen meadows are the main attractions in Vagamon. It is a favourite to the tourists for its vast view of the hills from the open space and chilly weather in any season. Vagamon is considered as the third main tourism destination in Idukki. \u201cWe hope the new infrastructure works will attract more tourists to the destination.

The woman had got an FIR registered against Binoy Kodiyeri at the Oshiwara police station here on June 13. The birth certificate and passport of the woman\u2019s eight-year-old son show Binoy Vinodini Balakrishnan alias Binoy Balakrishnan Kodiyeri as his father. The woman has already submitted several documents to the Oshiwara police as evidence of her close relationship with the CPM leader\u2019s son. The documents include her bank statements between 2010 and 2015, which showed Binoy Kodiyeri had electronically transferred Rs 80,000 to Rs 1 lakh every month to her as maintenance.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option.

She has also accused parents and teachers of verbally abusing her at a PTA meeting. Kottakkal police will record the statement of the 33-year-old teacher on Wednesday. According to the complaint filed by the woman, she has been working at the school for the past five years. She has been divorced for some time but was preparing for a second marriage. As the divorce procedures of the first marriage were getting delayed, she had started to live with her second husband even before legally marrying him. Later, they got legally married in June 2018 and she applied for maternity leave four months after the marriage. She delivered a baby on the second day after she applied for the leave. In her complaint, the woman said when she came to the school after her leave ended in January 2019, the school authorities did not allow her to rejoin pointing out that she had applied for maternity leave just four months into her marriage. The woman approached child rights commission seeking action against the school authorities. Subsequently, the commission sought a clarification from the deputy director of education (DDE). After a few months, when the summer vacation ended, the DDE completed its inquiry and issued a directive to the school authorities to allow the woman to rejoin service.

Justice PV Asha issued a stay for two months after considering during admission hearing a petition (WP-C No. 15937/2019) filed by higher secondary school teacher Saju Mathew of Kadanad in Kottayam and two others. In addition to this petition, Nair Service Society (NSS) and Aided Higher Secondary School Teachers Association have also approached the court. It was alleged in the petition that implementation of the report of the three-member committee headed by MA Khader to unify the three directorates \u2013 directorate of public instruction, higher secondary directorate, and vocational higher secondary directorate \u2013 goes against the provisions of Kerala Education Rules (KER). The government has issued an order whereby the principal of higher secondary wing has been entrusted with the charge of high school wing. The two wings are separate units and it is not intended in the statute, the petition said. It is pointed out by the petitioners that a higher secondary school teacher (HSST) requires a post graduation whereas a headmaster of a school need not have post graduation. On re-designating the headmaster as principal, he would be intermediate of HSST and principal. Thus, a lesser-qualified person is placed above the HSST, which is against fairness. When a headmaster is re-designated as vice principal, it would create a stalemate in granting promotion to HSST as principal over and above the vice principal. Such a system would create havoc in the realm of school administration, the petition said. In its petition, NSS has alleged that the government\u2019s move goes against Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE), in addition to Kerala Education Act and KER. The three-member committee went beyond its terms of reference and its recommendation for a monolithic administrative structure goes against RTE\u2019s idea of stand-alone primary and upper primary section with separate administrative setup, NSS has argued. The committee\u2019s recommendation also goes against the principle of decentralization and has proceeded without conducting any empirical study, NSS\u2019 plea had stated. Meanwhile, state government has filed an affidavit stating that it implemented the policy decisions after wide consultations with all stakeholders in the best interest of the public and the student community in general. A principal would hold the charge of all academic and administrative matters of higher secondary section whereas a vice principal will hold the charge of high school section, government said in the affidavit. Its decision to implement the unification in stages is intended to provide a uniform governance structure in all administrative and other matters in a campus having higher secondary school, high school, and vocational higher secondary school, government said, adding that there would be no change in service conditions, monetary benefits, or opportunities of employees.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

Inaction by the voter in getting his name restored also won\u2019t justify such action, the court said.

Names of his wife and daughter were retained while his was removed on the report of booth level officer that he changed his residence.

The judgment said, \u201cOn an evaluation of the said provisions, it is explicit that, they are peremptory in nature and can never be brushed aside or overlooked. Proviso thereto makes it clear that before removing a person from the voters list, the electoral registration officer is duty bound to give the person concerned a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of the action proposed to be taken. Which thus also means, the action or enquiry contemplated under Sec.22 of the Act, 1950 is not an empty formality, but on the other hand, founded on principles of natural justice, which if violated, action becomes arbitrary and illegal inviting action against the officer concerned.\u201d No opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner in the case, the court added. The Election Commission had contended that the removal from voters list was preceded by several steps such as inviting objections to draft electoral roll, including giving publicity to \u2018Deleted Lists\u2019 and that a final electoral roll was published at the end of a process that lasted over a year. After finding that no opportunity of hearing was granted to the petitioner, the court said, \u201cIt is also apposite to mention that, mere inaction on the part of the petitioner to restore the name removed from the voters list, is not a justification for removing the name, otherwise than in accordance with law.\u201d The court then ordered the chief election commissioner of Kerala to conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident and, if required, take appropriate action against the officers who removed the petitioner\u2019s name from the voters list within two weeks.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The woman from Mannarkkad had complained of sexual harassment against the Shoranur MLA, following which the later was suspended from the party for six months. During the two-day camp of the DYFI on Saturday and Sunday at Elappully, the DYFI district committee was reconstituted by allegedly demoting some of the party members who had supported the woman. The complainant had tendered her resignation following the move on Sunday. T M Sasi, the new district secretary of DYFI, said the issue of resignation would be taken up in the next district committee meet. He added that the reconstitution of the committee was a normal procedure followed in the organization and it was used to promote people on merit and demote those who do not discharge their responsibilities efficiently.

The resignation is also said to be in protest against the elevation of a DYFI leader as the district vice-president, who was accused of tarnishing the image of the woman leader through social media.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Bollywood actors who resorted to public transport": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/bollywood-actors-who-resorted-to-public-transport/photostory/65676673.cms", "description": ""}, "pavements kochi": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/pavementskochi/articleshow/69718295.cms", "description": ""}, "NEST 2019 Result": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/exam-results/nest-result-2019-declared-nestexam-in-heres-link-to-check-your-score/articleshow/69842705.cms", "description": ""}, "Thiruvananthapuram: Stalker tries to murder woman": {"datetime": "", "time": "2019-06-19 07:04:00", "description": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as people of the state are yet to recover from the shock of the incident where a policewoman was waylaid and burned alive by her stalker, a similar attempt was made on another woman in Kollam on Monday.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. He defeated Congress's Ramnaraian Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently concluded general election. He has also been elected to Rajasthan assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013.

In 1996, TDP leader G M C Balayogi was also a two-time MP when he was elected as the LS Speaker and after his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and the first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

According to those opposing the sudden decision to sign the PPA, it is unfair from the part of authorities to sign such an agreement when the project has not even received the crucial Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) clearance. As per a communique from KSEB, the power utility will sign the PPA with the private firm in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. \u201cThe PPA should be signed only after the project gets EIA nod. We don\u2019t understand why KSEB is signing the agreement in a hurry,\u201d said Kerala electricity workers federation state secretary Jacob Lazar. \u201cThere are many instances in which the KSEB ended up making losses after signing such agreements without considering the consequences. KSEB is still paying fixed charges to National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) though the agency has stopped purchasing power from the Kayamkulam plant. As per the agreement with NTPC, KSEB should pay fixed charges even if it doesn\u2019t purchase electricity from the firm. Similarly, KSEB had to pay fixed charges to a private firm at Eloor despite no electricity was purchased from them,\u201d Lazar said. According to experts in the field of energy and zero waste system, the agreement is being signed in a hurry only to protect the vested interests of certain officials. \u201cThe undue haste shown in signing the PPA points to the possibilities of corruption. Breaching the laws first and then getting it rectified has become an order of the day, especially in the case of the state government,\u201d said Zero Waste Systems consultant Shibu K N. \u201cSome of the top officials are behind the move. Their aim is to constitute a waste to energy management authority and place themselves at the top of the body,\u201d Shibu said. Meanwhile, officials with GJ Eco Power Private Limited said the decision to sign the PPA was taken before the general elections. \u201cJust a formal signing of the agreement is happening on Tuesday. There is nothing illegal or unfair in this,\u201d said an official with the firm. \u201cThe project would soon get EIA clearance. We have completed the public hearing as part of the EIA clearance.

There are more than 21,500 marine fishing vessels operating in the Kerala waters, of which more than 4,000 vessels are mechanized and another 11,000 accounts for motorized vessels. Studies by the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology have shown that energy efficient fishing systems including changes in the vessels, engine horsepower, gear and operations could reduce the carbon emissions. Fisheries scientists who have been working on sustainable fishing technology said that vessel design, construction and operation fishing gear and methods, adoption of advanced technology and fleet management conservation, management and enhancement of resources were the key. \u201cAcross the world studies have calculated the carbon footprint of major fish harvesting systems like trawling, purse seining, gillnetting and long lining. For example, in trawling, the global warming potential is 5.43 per kilo of fish caught,\u201d said Leela Edwin, head, department of fishing technology, CIFT. According to a series of studies by the CIFT scientists including Leela Edwin, Dhiju Das and Renju Ravi under a project on green fishing systems for tropical seas, fisheries in India consume as much as 1378.8 million litres of fuel and releases 3.13 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. The energy use in fishing begins from going to and from the fishing ground, dropping the nets, the fishing method, processing and transporting to consumer and this was calculated under the life cycle assessment of the individual fishing units. \u201cCIFT has worked with the Kerala government to fix optimum limits for boat engines and fishing gears. This along with other standards for the materials will ensure that we will be able to reduce the energy consumption in the fisheries sector. This will help in the usage of sustainable gear for the fishing sector and this is now being implemented in this sector,\u201d Leela Edwin said. Fishing vessel hull optimization, reduction of engine rpm, periodic maintenance of hull and replacement of two-stroke petrol engine to the inboard diesel engine is recommended to reduce the environmental impact related to the fishing operation. Use of high durable alternative webbing materials and appropriate use of lead sinkers will increase the life of gear and reduce environmental impacts.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony.

Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

This was allegedly in retaliation of workers of Muslim League\u2019s youth wing blocking vehicles of CPM leaders. Prosecution had then informed that a proper probe could not be conducted due to intimidatory tactics played by the party to which the leaders belong. In the chargesheet filed in February, CBI had named CPM leaders P Jayarajan and T V Rajesh to be involved in the conspiracy. A single bench of the high court had in February 2016 ordered CBI to conduct a further investigation in the case after considering a plea by the victim\u2019s mother.

But inside the hall at a trendy restaurant in Kochi, the atmosphere is heating up with talk of sex. It is a poetry evening, called Un-taboo, and a mixed crowd is talking about their bodies, love, loss, sexuality and abuse. \u201c\u2019Steady girl, take it slow\u2019,\u201d starts Sumi Thomas, as she reads her poem on lovemaking. \u201c... \u2018A little part of me laughs at the nerd that I am, the rest of me is burning with desire and cares not for correctness.\u2019\u201d Even if it is a small group which has pre-registered for the event, it is stunning to see that the wife and mother of two, albeit a media professional, doesn\u2019t mince or hold back her words and builds up her poem to a sexual and emotional crescendo. And a few others follow suit, attracting applause and drawn breaths in a couple of cases with the boldness of their words. Are women in conservative Kerala okay with expressing their feelings on their bodies and about sex openly? Sumi says, \u201cI know this poem is not exactly Kamala Das, but I posted it online because I felt I had to let out my voice for myself and my daughters.\u201d Anna Varghese Puthuran, a High Court lawyer who has worked with an NGO that works with building a new life for sexually abused women and children, says, \u201cI feel women need to reclaim spaces. This conversation has to be had. For how long can we run away from topics like this? I was always told off for writing explicitly and was told to write about pretty things, but it is important to go back to your authentic self whatever that might be. And maybe people are also more ready to accept women\u2019s voices now.\u201d And if they are not, don\u2019t feel bogged down by judgment, the women say. Lola hails from Kumbalam, a village on the backwaters of Kochi, but is today a globe-trotting artist. An exhibition she is planning this year in Kochi has vagina as its theme. The artist, who \u201cloves to draw and take pictures of nudes\u201d, says the worst comments come from people close to her family, but she gets about 30 messages every day from strangers admiring her work. But, even for an artist who posts pictures of herself in very revealing clothes on social media, there is a self-monitoring that takes place. \u201cSome days I\u2019m brave and some days I\u2019m not, but some posts can be an inspiration for others. If I\u2019m craving to do this so much, other women must be too; so why restrict their voices?\u201d she asks. As for her exhibition, she says Kochi is ready for it, because \u201cit\u2019s not sexual, it\u2019s art\u201d.  Sumi, who is now writing a short story \u2018with a lot of erotic elements\u2019, says, \u201cIf people judge my character based on what I write, it does not matter to me. All writing comes from some connection you feel to the stories that you are telling. I will write what I feel like writing.\u201d Lidiya Prasad, a copywriter, who moved to Kochi from Bengaluru, felt life here would be staid and culturally low-key, so she was happy to take part in an earlier adult poetry session. She recently published a book of her \u201cvery explicit and more low-key\u201d poems, and says, \u201cIt is not about rebelling, but people have to think of women beyond the good-girl and virgin labels. But funnily enough, though there are poems in my book which deals with other subjects, people only want to talk about the erotic stuff.\u201d  Women feel that there are inevitably several men who felt their words were an \u201cinvitation to casual sex\u201d. \u201cInitially, I used to cry thinking I invited this behaviour from men, but now I\u2019ve learnt that it is a problem they must deal with,\u201d says Lidiya.  Their families are a mix of understanding, encouraging and embarrassed. While the women are sometimes conscious that they must not post things that would embarrass their families, Anna says, \u201cOur relationships with our family get more mature as we age, and they become more respectful of our voice.\u201d  Jayakrishnan Pillai, whose media company organised the Un-taboo event, which was advertised on social media, says he received a call from an elderly man in Kozhikode congratulating them for holding the event, which he said was much-needed in our society. \u201cThis poetry event was a solution to the whole idea that women cannot express themselves freely on social media without attracting sexual and annoying comments from people. This was a chance to meet like-minded people and share thoughts without being questioned,\u201d he says. Apart from social media blurring the borders on what privacy mean, even a movement like the Kudumbashree has given women the opportunity to be outgoing, says activist Rekha Raj. She explains that at gender workshops, she meets lots of youngsters who question why their privacy is curtailed and just hang out and do the things they want to. \u201cEven the conversations in our homes are changing and families are discussing the idea of sexuality, thanks to the issues and the calls for rights in the queer movement. This is a positive change; it is probably reflecting quite slowly in society, but it is happening,\u201d she says.

It has been shifted to the morgue of a private hospital at her native place, Oachira in Kollam. Cremation would take place after the arrival of her husband Sajeev, who is working in Libya, on Tuesday, said police. Soumya , who was working at Vallikunnam police station, was hacked and set ablaze by N A Ajas (33), a civil police officer attached to Aluva traffic police station, on Saturday near her home at Thekkemuri in Vallikunnam grama panchayat. Soumya was working at Vallikunnam police stationAjas, who sustained over 40% burns, has been admitted to Alappuzha Medical College Hospital. Though police arrived at the hospital with magistrate to record his on Saturday night, he was not able to speak. The police have not registered his arrest still Sunday evening. Meanwhile, Soumya\u2019s mother Indira and elder son Rishikesh told media that Ajas had threatened and attacked her many times.  \u201cAmma (Soumya) had told me if anything happens to her, I should tell police that Ajas is responsible. She told me that the man had threatened her several times over phone. My father is unaware of these incidents,\u2019\u2019 Rishikesh said. According to Indira, \u201cAjas killed her after she turned down his marriage proposal. He had threatened to kill her and her husband many times. He had beaten her up with shoes. When I had offered to interfere, she said it might create more trouble. She had also informed Vallikunnam sub-inspector about the issue three months ago.\u201d However, Vallikunnam sub-inspector Shaiju Ebrahim said he was not informed. He added that Indira herself told him on Sunday that they did not inform police due to fear. He said Sowmya had borrowed Rs 1.25 lakh from Ajas. When she returned the money, Ajas did not accept it and demanded to marry him. She transferred the money to his account. But he sent it back to her account. Following this, Sowmya and Indira asked him to collect the money in person at KSRTC bus station, Ernakulam in May. Though he came to meet them, he refused to take the money back and dropped the duo at Clappana. When things started going out of hands, Sowmya blocked his number. But Ajas continued to stalk her from other numbers. Indira, too, had requested Ajas not to disturb her daughter, the officer said. Soumya had joined Kerala Police in 2014. She was trained under Ajas for around three months. They went on to become friends through social media, said her friends. Her husband was home a month ago on vacation.

With the success of the first solar passenger boat, the water transport department is all set to launch three more boats in the coming months. \u201cAditya, our first solar boat has been running successfully for the last two years and not a trip has been cancelled. The fuel costs have just been Rs 200-280 for electricity and we have saved about Rs 48 lakhs on diesel,\u201d said SWTD director Shaji Nair. Three of the boats including a cruise-liner will become operational in the next few months. The tendering process for the construction of another three boats will begin by the end of this year. Nair said that in contrast to the huge criticism and pressure that the department faced for venturing into solar-powered boats, Aditya is drawing international attention too. \u201cWe had senior officials from almost 40 countries visiting us recently to travel in the boat. They were part of the International solar alliance (ISA) and had come to look at the boat so that it could be replicated and customized in their countries,\u201d he said. Of the two new boats under construction at NavAlt, one will be a return boat in the Vaikkom- Thavanakadavu route while the other would be in the Panavally-Thiruvananthapuram route. The cruise-liner will be an air-conditioned, double-decker boat and deployed in Alappuzha for \u2018See Kuttanad\u2019 programme. These boats will be powered by a hybrid battery. \u201cDuring day time, we will use solar power and at night battery power,\u201d Nair said. The first solar boat, Aditya, has completed two years of service in January. During the period, the boat carried 6, 00,000 passengers and travelled around 38,000 km without a single drop of fuel thereby saving 58,000 litres of diesel. This saved Rs 45 lakhs in diesel and maintenance cost during the period. Sandith Thandasherry, the man behind India\u2019s first solar-powered ferry and CEO of NavAlt Solar and Electric Boats said that all countries in the tropical area were interested in the solar boats and the delegation which visited Aditya was in discussions with his company for manufacturing solar boats. He said that the ISA had offered to try to aggregate the combined demand the requirement of the countries as Aditya was a successful model of a public transport with a capacity of carrying 100 passengers. The Inland Waterways Authority of India has also evinced interest in running solar boats in the Ganga and Yamuna. \u201cThey have called for tenders for the Yamuna taxi and have kept very high technical standards,\u201d Sandith said. Meanwhile, Kochi Metro\u2019s water project is already looking at solar boats. Also, Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) is also looking at a solar-powered boat which is intended to be operated in the inland waterways.

Sreedharan, along with a team of experts from Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) Kanpur and Madras, visited the flyover around 8am and inspected the restoration works. The flyover has been closed for traffic for more than a month. Though Sreedharan spent around one and a half hours at the flyover inspecting the pillars, girders and the cracks, he refused to openly speak about the defects. According to DMRC sources, he is expected to submit an inspection report directly to the state government in the coming days based on which the state government will take a call on whether the flyover should be restored or demolished. Sreedharan was roped in for the inspection by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan after a meeting with PWD minister G Sudharkaran last week. Sreedharan, who started the inspection from the northern end of the flyover, walked beneath the 750m flyover and conducted a detailed inspection of each pillar and girder. Alaga Sundara Murthy, professor of structural engineering laboratory at the department of civil engineering at IIT-Madras, and Mahesh Tandon from IIT-Kanpur accompanied him through the inspection. Officials from PWD, roads and bridges development corporation of Kerala limited (RBDCK) and Kitco Ltd were also present. Murthy explained to Sreedharan the findings by the IIT-Madras team, which had earlier conducted a study of the flyover and found structural flaws. He showed him the cracks on the pillars and girders which have been posing threat to the bridge\u2019s stability. The reinforcement and restoration works of the flyover were also monitored by the team. The team reportedly raised concerns about the severe cracks on the girders. After the inspection beneath the bridge, the team went to the top of the bridge where they spent around 15 minutes to inspect the potholes and cracks. After this, Sreedharan concluded the inspection and returned to DMRC office where an internal meeting of all parties involved in the flyover construction was held.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The burn injuries have affected the functioning of kidneys. The doctors started dialysis on Monday,\u201d police said. However, Vallikunnam police are yet to register his arrest. According to police sources, Ajas said that he killed Soumya after she refused to marry him and she kept a distance from him. Meanwhile, Soumya\u2019s relatives said that her cremation will be held by Wednesday noon. Her body is kept in the morgue of a private hospital at her native place at Oachira in Kollam. Her husband Sajeev, who is working in Libya, will reach home by Wednesday morning, a relative said. However, another relative of Soumya said that some MGNREGA workers who were at work near Soumya\u2019s home had told them that it was not just Ajas in the car. \u201cThey told us that one more person was inside the car and he ran away when Ajas alighted from the vehicle.

Ajas, who was waiting in a rented car, in front of Soumya\u2019s home, rammed her scooter and knocked her down on Saturday. Seeing Ajas alight from the car, Soumya tried to flee but Ajas attacked her with a sword. Soumya managed to run to a neighbour\u2019s house after crossing a small canal. Ajas chased her, poured petrol over her body and set her on fire using a cigarette lighter. Soumya was the younger daughter of Pushpakaran and Indira of Clappana in Kollam. Pushpakaran, 67, suffered stroke four years ago and is now not able to go for work. Indira, a tailor by profession, met the study expenses of Soumya, a graduate, and her elder sister.

A petition filed by CBI seeking transfer of trial and further proceedings to the special court here was considered by the high court. Transferring of the case pending before Thalassery sessions court is needed so that the additional report filed in the case can also be considered by the trial court, CBI had argued. CBI approached the high court after the Thalassery court declined to accept its report and asked it to approach the special court in Ernakulam. The high court had earlier stayed further proceedings in the case at Thalassery sessions court. It was on February 20, 2012 that Shukkoor was murdered in broad daylight after holding him hostage at Ariyil near Pattuvam in Kannur. This was allegedly in retaliation of workers of Muslim League\u2019s youth wing blocking vehicles of CPM leaders. In the chargesheet filed in February this year, CBI had named CPM leaders P Jayarajan and TV Rajesh to be involved in the conspiracy. A single bench of the high court had in February 2016 ordered CBI to conduct a further investigation in the case after considering a plea by the victim\u2019s mother. The court had pointed out that all those who were with the leaders were named as accused on conspiracy charge but they have been avoided. They were instead booked for a lighter offence, of not trying to prevent the murder after getting information about the conspiracy, the single bench had stated. Jayarajan and Rajesh had approached a division bench challenging the single bench\u2019s judgment but the order for further investigation was confirmed in February 2017.

Asked about Congress' Delhi unit president Sheila Dikshit's remarks that Kejriwal never approached her for an alliance, the chief minister said, \u201cWe have met Rahul Gandhi. Dikshit is not that important leader.\u201d Kejriwal has been urging the Congress to stitch an alliance in Delhi for the Lok Sabha polls to keep the BJP away from power. Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.
