The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis would be the first person, who will attend the programme and address shivsainik on the occasion of party's 53rd foundation days, on Wednesday evening at Matunga's Shanmugham hall.  A Sena leader confirmed that CM Fadnavis has been invited by the party or foundation day programme and has been accepted an invitation by him. Late Sena Supremo Balasaheb Thackeray had a good rapport with many political party top brass beyond politics. Sena wants to spread a message that 'all is well' in the saffron alliance.  such as socialist George Fernandes, former home minister in the state and late congress leader Balasaheb Desai, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Communist leader Shripad Amrut Dange, former CM and congress leader Vasantdada Patil and few others were witnessed at some or other event organised by Sena. Sr Thackeray also met former prime minister Indira Gandhi, Chandrashekhar, I K Gujral, former Tamil Nadu CM MK Karunanidhi and other national leaders to discuss the issues, however no one was invited for the foundation day, other than a party member. Sena wants to spread a message that 'all is well' in the saffron alliance. \"Misleading news about bitterness among both got spread over since last few days. But we are in an alliance and misleading news could lead to spread wrong message across all, 288 assembly constituencies ahead of assembly polls. To should avoid such misunderstanding ahead of elections was an important task, hence the party invited Fadnavis to address shivsainiks,\" said a Sena functionary. While asked why only Fadnavis, \"He is a good orator with clean image, understanding, clear thoughts and a leading leader of the BJP in the state. Not only BJP cadre but even Shivsainiks are fond of him. Sharing dais with Uddhavji could be normal thing but participating as a special guest for only Sena function will definitely clear the air between both cadre and that will help both while facing assembly polls soon,\" he added.

The Aarey police arrested Kandivli resident Sudhanshu Saboo and took him to the nearest hospital for a medical check-up where preliminary test revealed that he was driving under the influence of alcohol. \u201cThe accused does not have a driving licence and was driving drunk,\u201d said Aarey police senior inspector Vijaylaxmi Hiremath. Additional commissioner of police (north region) Dilip Sawant said: \u201cWe are also collecting details of the firm that allowed Saboo to drive without checking if he had a valid licence. Action will be taken against the authorities in whose name the car is registered.\u201d The police said around 1.45am, Saboo was driving the SUV at over 120kmph and rammed into the aggregator cab, which spun three times before it came to a halt. The injured driver, Suraj Ramani (21), managed to stagger out of the vab, but the passenger, Shailesh Mishra (33), who was in the back seat, suffered a deep cut between his nose and chin and was profusely bleeding. \u201cOnly four people came forward to help us and nab Saboo; others were busy clicking pictures and making videos of the incident on their phones. Someone even stole my phone and Rs 1,250 cash from my pocket,\u201d said Ramani, who had bought his car on loan just three months ago. \u201cThere were two more people in the SUV, besides the teenage driver. They both fled the spot.\u201d Ramani and Mishra were taken to a civic-run hospital, but the latter died before treatment. \u201cI had to get a chest X-ray of my chest. I also suffered injuries on my leg,\u201d said Ramani.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

The project, which was introduced in 2014, has been delayed and it has resulted in cost escalation-almost double the initial estimate of nearly Rs 3,500 crore. The 20km bypass, which will have 11km of tunnels, 1.6km of bridges and an eight-lane road towards Khalapur (Panvel) and Kusgaon (near Sinhagad Institute), will reduce the Mumbai-Pune distance by half an hour as vehicles will be able to avoid the steep ghats and traffic jams. It is being carved out to separate the Expressway from the old highway. Traffic from the Expressway as well as the old highway take the same stretch through the ghats resulting in jams, delays, fuel consumption and pollution, said an official. The bypass will be part of the Expressway and the existing ghat section will remain purely for three and two-wheelers plying on the old highway.  MSRDC officials said work on the tunnel approach way towards Sinhagad Institute had already begun. While Navayuga Engineering Company is working on the tunnels, the viaduct or cable-stay bridges are being constructed by Afcons Infrastructure Limited. Geodata-LB consortium are the project consultants. The MSRDC is the nodal agency for the project. Also, around 30,000km of new roads are being built at a cost of Rs 18,000 crore under the Chief Minister Village Road Connectivity programme. Other projects underway are the Rs 55,000 crore Mumbai-Nagpur super-communication highway and around Rs 7,600 crore sewage, road and water supply projects undertaken by the PWD, Mungantiwar said.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. He defeated Congress's Ramnaraian Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently concluded general election.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

Navi Mumbai builders who are members of CREDAI-MCHI (Raigad) had filed a complaint with MahaRera, seeking that the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) be made a co-promoter of their projects. They contended that Cidco delays its obligations after selling the plots and, as a result, their projects get held up and they are held liable for the delay. They said Cidco must be made a promoter under Rera because it is a public authority and MCHI members are allottees of plots owned by Cidco. MahaRera chairperson Gautam Chatterjee ruled that the sale transactions effected by Cidco are sale of immovable property where permissions for development is yet to be given by the competent authority. \"Such transaction does not fall under the definition of a real estate project,\" he said. The order said Cidco can be made a promoter along with the builder in cases where Cidco is mandated to develop \"off-site infrastructure\" around the plot. In its complaint, MCHI said that Cidco does not register tenders inviting bids with Rera even though it was mandated to do so. \"Cidco has not followed the provisions of Rera in its agreements and dealings with the highest bidder and is contravening the provisions of Rera,\" it said . The complainant said that Cidco is required to register the scheme as a project with Rera prior to advertising, marketing and inviting bids for the plots. Besides, Cidco is liable for various obligations to be performed pre- and post-tender like removal of encroachments and encumbrances, final demarcation of plot, providing water and drainage connections. The builders, who plan to file an appeal against Chatterjee's order, said Cidco frequently delays carrying out these tasks. As a result, they face flak from flat buyers, who drag them before the housing authority for project delays. \"Cidco falls under the ambit of 'promoter' under Rera and its activities of inviting bids for plots and allotment of the same for lease of 60 years fall under the provisions of Rera,\" said the builders. Counsel for Cidco said the corporation sold plots after a public tender to prospective developers to develop and construct flats to be sold to third parties. \"There we are not liable to register the sale of such plots with MahaRera,\" he said. In his order, Chatterjee said if the developer's plot acquired from Cidco is dependent on certain off-site infrastructure that has to be provided by Cidco, then \"while registering their projects with MahaRera, the builders can include Cidco as a promoter (land-owner)\".

The list included 16 names from Maharashtra. While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination.

This year, the municipal corporation says it is better prepared and will clear water from Hindmata faster. Though the BMC does not guarantee a totally flood-free area, it says the drain augmentation work it carried out in Hindmata will ensure rainwater does not remain accumulated for long periods. A visit to several waterlogging spots identified by the traffic police in Dadar, Sion, King\u2019s Circle and Mahim found that while many works had been completed, concerns among locals remained. Works to reconstruct 2,500 metres of storm water drain (SWD) lines were taken up by the BMC around Hindmata \u2014 at Madkebuwa Chowk at Parel and Lalbaug police chowki. In the stretch from Lalbaug police chowky to Shravan Yashwante Chowk, while earlier there was an SWD line of 3000 mm by 2700 mm, there is an extra SWD proposed of 1,800 mm diameter, said officials. This work, though not fully complete, is expected to provide some relief. \u201cThis is a low-lying area and one cannot give a guarantee that water will not accumulate on a heavy rain day. But with augmentation works done, we hope that unlike earlier years, when rainwater would remain for an entire day, the accumulation may last only a few hours,\u201d local corporator Urmila Panchal from the Shiv Sena said. A resident of Bhoiwada, Panchal said pumps for de-watering had also been placed. Then there are the other waterlogging spots like Dadar TT and Five Gardens. Dadar Parsi Colony resident Zarine Engineer said: \u201cDadar TT would previously witness a lot of waterlogging but that has reduced now considerably. With waterlogging spots identified in the area, my only concern is that that manhole lids are placed in all areas.\u201d In King\u2019s Circle, Gandhi Market remain a flooding spot. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complex issue as we are not able to find space for laying an SWD line,\u201d an official said.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The policy included personal accident coverage. Hiren got married and went on a honeymoon to Manali on a trip organized by Heena Tours and Travels. One of the attractions was paragliding. The paragliding activities were operated by trained persons. Hiren\u2019s parachute, however, developed a technical snag, and the pilot could not control it, leading to a crash on a rocky hill. Hiren sustained grievous injuries in the accident which occurred on December 10, 2014. He was hospitalized till January 6, 2015 after which he returned to Mumbai for further hospitalization and treatment which continued till April 4, 2015. As the accident had occurred during subsistence of the policy-- valid from November 20, 2014 to November 19, 2015-- he filed a claim under the policy. The insurer rejected the claim on the ground that paragliding was a risky activity, and that the policy did not cover accidents occurring during aviation or ballooning except as a bonafide passenger. Since Hiren was paragliding, the insurer termed it a hazardous activity which was excluded under the policy. Hiren approached the insurance ombudsman who upheld the insurer\u2019s stand, so he filed a consumer complaint. Advocate Ami Mandani who represented Hiren, argued the exclusion clause was not applicable since Hiren was not operating the parachute while paragliding, but was merely enjoying a joy ride which was being operated by a trained pilot. Even a tour operator had endorsed this fact, but the insurer argued the tour operator was not entitled to opine. It defended the repudiation under clause 4.19 of the policy.  The forum observed the policy was in existence since several years during which period no claim had been made. It concurred with advocate Ami Mandani that the exclusion clause would not apply to joy rides under trained pilots. The forum also noted that clause 4.19 of the policy had no bearing on the dispute. Accordingly, by its order of June 1, 2019 delivered by M P Kashar for the bench headed by Sneha Mhatre and D S Paradkar, the forum concluded the claim had been wrongly repudiated which constituted a deficiency in service. It noted even though the expenses for treatment had exceeded the coverage limit, Hiren had restricted his claim to the benefits available under the policy. The forum ordered Oriental Insurance to pay Rs 6 lakh for medical expenses and Rs 1,28,125 as personal accident benefit. Both these amounts would carry 3% interest from the date of the complaint being filed. In addition, Rs7,000 was awarded as compensation for mental agony and Rs 3,000 as litigation costs. The insurer has been given two months to comply with the order. (The author is a consumer activist and has won the Govt. of India\u2019s National Youth Award for Consumer Protection.

But some principals were sceptical about the move. \u201cWe are willing to help the government but the solution isn\u2019t a permanent one. The government needs to think about the evaluation pattern for the next year,\u201d said the principal of a south Mumbai college. Senior officials said they have shortlisted the top 50 colleges where the cut-offs in the second merit list last year were above 80%, indicating high popularity. \u201cTo ensure SSC topscorers have an equal chance as their CBSE and ICSE peers at such colleges, we met their principals on Monday and proposed the seat increase,\u201d said Suvarna Kharat, joint secretary of the school education department. Last year, as only 2.3 lakh students applied for 3 lakh seats, 72,000 remained vacant in Mumbai. The education department has identified 19 and 21 such colleges in Pune and Nagpur, respectively, and will increase their seats by 10% in all streams. Principals of these colleges are divided on the decision. \u201cThe increase can be accommodated at our college. It would mean taking in 10 students in addition to the existing 120,\u201d said Parag Thakkar, principal, H R College, Churchgate. Some other colleges, however, have infrastructural constraints. A vice-principal of a popular junior college in the western suburbs said: \u201cTo accommodate 120 students, we already seat them four per bench, and there is no more space in the classroom. With attendance being strict at our college, it is near impossible to take in extra students.\u201d Another junior college in the west hasn\u2019t increased their seats in the past 20 years due to lack of space. The principal of a top college in the city pointed out another key issue. Even if the increase is only for the current academic year, it will affect the college for the next few years. \u201cCurrently, the number of our in-house HSC students is equal to the seats available in the bachelor\u2019s course. Only a few of them don\u2019t seek admission and we are left with a handful of seats for outsiders. When this batch comes to first year degree college, we might have a problem. Some principals have also raised concerns if this doesn\u2019t remain a one-time increase. Our infrastructure cannot bear the burden,\u201d said the principal.

They called cops, who came and asked her to file an FIR at the Charu Market police station. It was 1.30 a.m. when she reached there but, instead of taking down her complaint, the cops there directed her to Bhowanipore police station where the first assault had occured. \u201cI just gave up and started shouting at this point.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option. We need to see how this will pan out.\" In Video:Bill seeking to lift green card cap amended to protect US workersDownload The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."}, "unattended by G/N ward BMC inspite complaint": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/unattendedbyg2fnwardbmcinspitecomplaint/articleshow/69834412.cms", "description": ""}, "Bollywood actors who would be great teachers": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/bollywood-actors-who-would-be-great-teachers/photostory/65684334.cms", "description": ""}, "Samsung": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/heres-how-samsung-got-mocked-for-its-social-media-post/articleshow/69835890.cms", "description": ""}, "Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis meets Shiv Sena chief, discusses cabinet expansion": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//videos/city/mumbai/maharashtra-cm-devendra-fadnavis-meets-shiv-sena-chief-discusses-cabinet-expansion/videoshow/69798829.cms", "description": ""}, "PM Modi": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections-2019/odisha/news/lok-sabha-election-govt-has-taken-measures-to-set-up-chowkidar-in-space-pm-modi-in-odisha/articleshow/68627439.cms", "description": "JEYPORE: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said his government had taken measures to set up a 'chowkidar' in space and asked people to vote for a government that can take concrete decisions and not just raise slogans.

They will now say we will take 100 more years to identify critical wildlife areas,\u201d remarked a bench of chief justice Pradeep Nandrajog and justice Nitin Jamdar. The court was hearing a public interest litigation by NGO Vanashakti on protection and conservation of wildlife and wildlife habitat following the failure of authorities to demarcate critical wildlife habitats in forest areas. Advocates Ahmed Abdi and Zaman Ali argued that many critically endangered species had become extinct due to inaction on the part of authorities. The court was told there are 49 wildlife sanctuaries and six national parks in Maharashtra. The judges noted that the 2006 Act states critical wildlife habitats need to be kept inviolated and free from human intervention. They lamented such legislations give reason to evict tribals from forest areas. \u201cThe tribal is the best guardian of the forest. Actual culprits are those who make resorts,\u201d said the CJ. \u201cBecause we have taken over the right to be custodians of forests, we have become custodians of forests,\u201d said the CJ, adding the court would monitor the PIL in a careful manner. In-charge government pleader, Priyabhushan Kakade, said, in January 2018, the Central government had issued guidelines on demarcation of critical wildlife habitat and the state government had formed 36 committees in August 2018. Abdi said nothing had moved forward after formation of the committees and the work of committees had remained only on paper. The judges then directed the government to inform the court at the next hearing what scientific and objective criteria the committees would employ to identify critical wildlife habitats.

Close aides of Tejashwi said he is expected to address around 200 election meetings across the state over the next two months. \u201cTejashwi is the face of RJD and the star campaigner of Mahagathbandhan.

Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

Community leaders termed the move an \"election gimmick\" as \"the government is offering sops while avoiding demands\". The OBC communities are upset with the government as they feel the 16% quota granted to Marathas could eat into their share of reservation. Also, the Dhangars, who are part of OBC at present, have a grouse with the state as it has been mum on their demand to be included in Scheduled Tribes (ST) category. \"This is all an election gimmick,\" said Prakash Shendge, former MLA and Dhangar community leader, adding, \"We do not want money, but reservation.\" The BJP had assured the Dhangars ST status during the 2014 assembly election campaign. Dhangars constitute about 12% of the state's population and can influence 90-odd assembly seat results. Shendge said no scheme will be implemented before the elections. In the interim budget presented on Tuesday, state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar proposed a Rs 200 crore grant for the Maharashtra State OBC Finance and Development Corporation. This would be on the lines of Annasaheb Patil Financial Development Corporation, which provides loans to Marathas. The state has also approved 36 hostels-18 for girls and boys-for OBC communities, and kept aside Rs 200 crore in the 2019-20 fiscal for their welfare. Also, OBC girls in classes V-VII will get a scholarship of Rs 60 per month and those in classes VIII-X will get Rs 100 per month. SSC and HSC toppers in the OBC category will get cash awa-rds of Rs 1 lakh and Rs 51,000. The state has kept aside Rs 1,000 crore for Dhangars' welfare and plans to implement 22 schemes on the lines of sops for the ST category.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

He said a sizeable number of people had responded positively to such an amnesty scheme last year. It may be recalled that several flat owners in housing societies who have bought or sold their apartments must pay penalties for a delay in stamp duty payment. In Mumbai alone, 7,000 property owners have aired their desire to pay penalty under this amnesty scheme. Also, lakhs of housing societies are to get ownership of land under the conveyance deed scheme. Stamp duty is charged at a standard 5% across Maharashtra and an additional 1% as surcharge for Mumbai property buyers. While the stamp duty is payable as per that year\u2019s rate, the mounting penalty over it will get largely waived.

In a First Information Report (FIR) registered on June 13 at Oshiwara police station (TOI is in possession of the FIR) Binoy Vinodini Balakrishnan alias Binoy Balakrishnan Kodiyeri has been charged under Indian Penal Code sections 376 & 376(2) (n) (rape), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation). The complainant, mother of an eight-year-old boy, filed the complaint after she discovered late in 2018 that the man Binoy Balakrishnan Kodiyeri, who was having a relationship with her and had repeatedly promised to marry her, was already married and has two kids in Kerala. Oshiwara police senior inspector Shailesh Pasalwar said they are probing the case and procedures are underway before action is taken against the accused. Pasalwar said that so far, they have not issued LOC (look out circular) against the accused. He showered me with moneyIn her complaint, the woman said: \u201cIn September 2009, with the help of my friend I went to Dubai and worked at Mehfil Dance Bar. During this period, I came across Binoy Balakrishnan Kodiyeri. He used to shower me with money and gained my trust. One day he took my number and started communicating with me -- he told he is from Kerala and runs a construction business in Dubai. He became a close friend and even gave me costly gifts before he proposed to me and asked me to leave my work.\u201d The woman, who hails from a poor family, after losing her father had come to Mumbai in 2007 and stayed at her elder sister\u2019s house, where she learnt dance. In October 2009, according to the complaint, Binoy Balakrishnan Kodiyeri took the woman to his Dubai house where he assured of marrying her and they had a physical relationship. In February 2010, Binoy Balakrishnan Kodiyeri got the woman a rented flat in Andheri (West) and he paid the rent. \u201cI pestered him to marry me during this period. But he used to give excuses. I asked him to introduce me to his family but he again gave excuses. On July 22, 2010 I gave birth to a baby boy. He met me in the hospital and regularly visited to see me and the child. In 2011, he got me another house at Millat Nagar. It is then that my mother asked me to tell him that we should get married. Binoy told that he will marry me during our son\u2019s first birthday and kept giving monthly maintenance. In 2014 after the rent agreement expired, he got me another rental apartment in Jogeshwari. In 2015, he told me that his business was running in loss and that he cannot afford to pay me for my upkeep,\u201d the woman said in the FIR. In 2018, the woman learnt that a Rs 13 crore Dubai-based fraud allegedly involving Binoy Balakrishnan Kodiyeri had come to light. \u201cThe woman then checked Binoy\u2019s Facebook profile. She found that Binoy had three Facebook accounts, of which two were inactive. The third has detailed information about him and his family in Kerala which he had created in 2019; this profile helped the woman identify the real Binoy,\u201d a source close to the complainant told TOI. \u201cAt this point, when she tried to contact him again to make him marry her, the accused\u2019s family threatened her with dire consequences,\u201d the source added.

Asked about Congress' Delhi unit president Sheila Dikshit's remarks that Kejriwal never approached her for an alliance, the chief minister said, \u201cWe have met Rahul Gandhi. Dikshit is not that important leader.\u201d Kejriwal has been urging the Congress to stitch an alliance in Delhi for the Lok Sabha polls to keep the BJP away from power. Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital.

The reason given is that these structures have become old and dilapidated. But the question on everyone' Why has the BMC woken up all of a sudden? \"This appears to be a knee-jerk reaction following the fatal Himalaya FOB crash at CSMT in March,\" says G R Vora, a member of the F-North ward Citizens' Federation and resident of Sion where two FOBs at King Circle were recently shut for inspection. \"Civic officials first neglected bridge maintenance and have now realized that many are beyond repair and have to be pulled down.\" Of the 29 bridges classified as 'dangerous', eight have been razed and over a dozen shut for vehicular and pedestrian movement. The two FOBs at King Circle are not part of the 'dangerous' bridges list, but have been shut after the re-audit dound some damages in the structures. Additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal, in charge of civic bridges department, says: \"We did not want to close all these bridges, but were left with no choice. We cannot play with people's lives. We are looking at alternative traffic arrangements and solutions.\" Short-staffed departmentA study of the reasons for the sudden closures exposes serious gaps in the functioning of the country's richest municipal body-to start with, a severely short-staffed bridges department that is barely six years old. Of the sanctioned 104 posts, 47 are vacant. This means there are only 57 staffers overseeing 300-plus bridges, FOBs, vehicular and pedestrian subways and skywalks, including the 29 'dangerous' bridges aged between two and six decades. The numerous vacancies in existing posts seems ironic considering the department has asked for an extra 116 new posts to be created. Prior to 2013, city bridges were maintained by the roads and traffic department and an assistant engineer (bridges) would report to the road department head. But with more bridges coming up across the city, the need was felt for a dedicated bridges department. The first chief engineer of the new department was S O Kori, who is currently behind bars in the Himalaya FOB crash incident for 'lack of supervision'. Nitai Mehta, founder and managing trustee of NGO Praja Foundation whose recent report analysed the staff crunch in BMC, says: \"The fundamental problem is the corporation today is only fire-fighting instead of looking at long-term solutions...Many of these bridges are a part of the old infrastructure and need to undergo periodic inspections and maintenance. Instead, the administration is focused on constructing new infrastructure to create ribbon-cutting moments.\" Also, the number of vehicles on roads is rapidly increasing, putting pressure on infrastructure. As on March 2019, there were over 36.4 lakh vehicles on city roads (up from 33.5 lakh in 2018), of which 58.6% were two-wheelers, 29.3% cars, jeeps, station wagons, 3.7% taxis/cabs, 5.8% autos, 0.4% buses and 2.2% goods vehicles. 'Few checks, bad upkeep'BMC's bridges manual, that was brought out in 2011, says assistant engineers must inspect bridges twice a year-in April and in October. Accordingly, major/minor repairs, if required, need to be taken up. The inquiry conducted by the civic vigilance department in the Himalaya FOB crash incident blamed the department for not following the manual. The first-ever audit done by the department was only after the tragic 2016 Mahad bridge collapse on Savitri river in Raigad. The audit covered 253 brid- ges-150 in western suburbs, 64 in eastern suburbs and 39 in the island city. The report was delayed and it was only after the pedestrian section of Andheri's Gokhale bridge collapsed on July 3, 2018, that corporators demanded its immediate release. The report had recommended demolition of 14 'dangerous' bridges-six in western suburbs, five in eastern suburbs and three in the island city-major repairs for 61 structures and minor repairs for 107. But six months later, in March 2019, when the Himalaya FOB, which was found to be in a 'good condition' in the audit, crashed, a re-audit was sought. This re-audit added 15 more bridges to the 'dangerous' list taking the total number to 29. The BMC has spent nearly Rs 2.5 crore on the structural audits of the bridges. A senior, independent expert underscored the significance of such checks. \"Usually after a bridge is constructed, there is need for periodic maintenance and repairs after 30 years. But it is often seen that during repairs, new layers are added without removing the earlier layers, which adds to the dead load,\" says Shirish Sukhtame, former president of Practicing Engineers Architects and Town Planners Association. Most bridges have a deck type construction with two girders as side support, but the deck in between, on which people walk, is much thinner. \"During structural audits, owing to this layer over layer, the welding joints are not accessible. There is a need to routinely check the structure and replace anything if required, but part by part, without inconveniencing the public,\" adds Sukhtame. Clearly, such a system is absent. Chetan Raikar, a structural engineer, also suggests fundamental changes in the work culture. \"Engineers should get both classroom and on-job training once they are inducted,\" he adds.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

A similar complaint was made against the principal by a teacher of the college where he was previously employed. The principal has denied the allegations and said the complaints were made with malicious intent. On Tuesday, members of Prahar Students Organisation and Nationalist Students Congress staged a protest at the college premises. \u201cIn spite of an FIR, the police have not taken any action and the college allows him to continue as principal,\u201d said Ajay Tapkir, secretary, Prahar Students Organisation.

The principal told TOI: \u201cIt appears that a conspiracy has been hatched against me to tarnish my clean image. Earlier, the university\u2019s women\u2019s commission had dismissed such a complaint made by a teacher and hence she had filed a complaint with Tilak Nagar police station in 2018 for the alleged 2007 incident.

The BMC barricaded a dilapidated bridge over Nilkanth nullah in Ghatkopar (E), but decided to re-open the one over Laxmi Baug nullah for light vehicles by month-end. The bridge over Nilkanth nullah is the 14th 'dangerous' bridge shut by the corporation in the last few months. Built in 1986, the bridge over Nilkanth nullah in Ghatkopar (E) is one of the connectors for local motorists heading towards Tilak Nagar in Chembur and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus in Kurla. \"This bridge was one of the entry points into Ghatkopar, hence, traffic movement may take a hit for a few days,\" said local corporator Parag Shah. A senior civic official from the bridges department said this bridge had not made it to the initial list of 14 'dangerous' bridges. \"The audit, carried out between 2016 and 2018, had stated that the bridge over Nilkanth nullah required major repairs. But the re-audit done after the fatal Himalaya foot over-bridge crash at CSMT in March declared this bridge dangerous. Hence, we decided to shut it,\" added the official. Shah said the BMC wanted to shut access to the bridge a few days back. \"But we asked them to start the process for demolition and reconstruction first and then shut it, which it has done,\" he said. The decision to re-open the bridge over Laxmi Baug nullah for light vehicles is based on an IIT-B report. \"We had sought the opinion of IIT-B experts, who, after an inspection, submitted a report recommending that the bridge could be opened for light vehicles by placing I-beams over the same steel plates,\" said a civic official. \"We have already called an agency to procure the required material and begin the works on priority basis. We hope to allow light vehicles to ply on the bridge within a fortnight.\" Local NCP corporator Rakhi Jadhav said she had been urging the BMC to make arrangements and re-open the bridge, at least for light vehicles.
