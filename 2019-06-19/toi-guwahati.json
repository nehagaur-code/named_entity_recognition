In Kamrup (Metropolitan), the maximum annual fees a college can charge for science (major) is Rs 6,820 and for science (general) is Rs 6,040.

The operations were launched following chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal's direction to Assam Police chief Kuladhr Saikia to take action against illegal syndicates in the state. Raunak Ali Hazarika, Assam Police's Deputy Inspector General (Western Range), told TOI, \"In the joint operation of Dhubri and South Salmara-Mankachar Police, several pre-dawn raids were conducted at various locations of both the districts simultaneously against known cattle smugglers and their associates. During the operation, 12 known cattle smugglers were apprehended and at least 13 cattleheads and some iron fence cutting tools were seized.\" Amongst the arrestees, at least three were from Dhubri and the rest from South Salmara district. The recovery of the iron fence cutting tools from the cattle smugglers' possession indicated the latest modus operandi of these smugglers. \"They (cattle smugglers) have admitted to using these tools to cut the barbwires in the international borders to push their cattle to the other side,\" said a police source. He added that these smugglers were waiting for rainy nights to smuggle the cattle. Meanwhile, city police, too, nabbed at least four cattle smugglers in a separate operation. From digging tunnels under the border fences to pushing the cattle through riverine areas, the smugglers are known for adopting various methods. The international cattle smuggling rackets were found to have gone hyperactive recently with the growing demand in Bangladesh during the Ramzan festivities. Earlier, some 12 cattle smugglers were apprehended and some 138 cattleheads seized by the BSF in separate operations in May. On Wednesday, during the Director General level meeting of the BSF and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) at Dhaka in Bangladesh, the issue of smuggling of cattle was discussed.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

While two along with arms and ammunition were held from Priloo Ronghang village of Karbi Anglong district, the other two were arrested from Hojai. In the first operation, police sleuths carried out a search operation in Priloo Ronghang village from where two of the gang members were held. \"They were identified as Gyan Bahadur Lama and Nikhil Terang. At least 100 FICNs having a face value of Rs 2,000, along with a 7.65 pistol and three rounds of live ammunitions, were seized from their possession,\" police sources said. Based on the revelations made by the duo, police launched a separate manhunt in Doboka area of Hojai district. \"In the second operation, police arrested two other gang members - Faijul Islam and Jayanta Singh. Police have also recovered 26 fake notes having a face value of Rs 500 and five counterfeit notes of Rs 2,000 denomination,\" police sources added. Police informed that FICNs having a total of worth Rs 2.23 lakh were seized in the entire operation. The arrest of the gang members comes a day after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took custody of three persons, Motaleb Ali, Dilbar Hussain and Amir Hamza, who were arrested from Islampur area of Paltan Bazar here in April with FICNs of having a face value of Rs 1.84 lakh. The premier investigation agency had taken over the case following an order issued from the counter-terrorism and counter-radicalisation division of the Union home ministry. The NIA in its investigation has been trying to trace links to an international racket based in Pakistan and Bangladesh which is allegedly involved in cross-border operations, with its fake notes believed to be used for terror funding. On the other hand, the state police have been also conducting operations against similar rackets. \"From 2017 to April this year, state police have registered more than 206 cases in connection with counterfeit notes. What is more worrying that the numbers of FICN cases have doubled from 2016, when only 63 such cases were recorded,\" said police sources. An ongoing investigation, following the arrests of over 50 operatives of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) in the state, has exposed a clear link between the nexus of FICN racketeers and the Islamic fundamentalist outfits. Assam's South Salmara-Mankachar, Dhubri, Hailakandi, Darrang, Cachar and Karbi Anglong districts were found to be vulnerable to FICN rackets due to their close proximity to Bangladesh.

He, however, was quick to clarify that he is not endorsing the RSS ideology though. \"Let me make it clear that I am dead against the RSS ideology. What I am saying is that we should only look into how RSS could expand its activities through a network of socio-cultural organizations and develop mass contact among people. We know how RSS pracharaks stay in villages and develop close ties with them. So, what is the harm if we, in Congress, also embark on on a similar exercise sans the RSS ideology?\" Gogoi said at a press conference here. He added that one of the reasons for Congress's defeat is its weakening mass contact. \"We were in power for three terms. This made us think that we are invincible. Now that we are routed, we should take it as an opportunity to find out our mistakes, rectify them and start working with full energy,\" said the former chief minister. Countering BJP's Mission 100, Congress on Saturday announced Mission 80, targeting to win 80 out of 126 assembly seats in 2021 assembly polls. During its extended executive meeting presided over by the party in-charge for Assam and former Uttarakhand CM, Harish Rawat, Congress said it has pulled up its socks for the assembly polls by reaching out to people at the grassroots and exposing the failures of the BJP-led coalition government in the state. \"We have to accomplish our Mission 80. For making it happen, we all have to work on mission mode. So, we need a robust mass contact exercise which the RSS has. I will be at the forefront of this campaign,\" Gogoi said. Ruling out that dissidence within Congress after the party poor show in the Lok Sabha polls would hamper the Grand Old Party's prospects in future, Gogoi said the party has thousands of dedicated workers against a handful of rebels. On Saturday, Congress had suspended its general secretary Ramen Borthakur for seeking ouster of incumbent party president Ripun Bora following the party's debacle in the Lok Sabha polls. Also, Congress has suspended its former minister from the Barak Valley, Gautam Roy, for reportedly celebrating BJP's victory in Silchar and Karimganj.

The incident took place at Sewpur tea estate at around 1.30pm on Friday. Locals said Ajay had informed his in-laws and neighbours on June 5 that his wife, Radha Tanti (23), and daughter had gone missing. As the duo remained traceless, Radha's family members, suspecting foul play, reached the couple's home and started searching their place. The shadow of suspicion fell on the in-laws because there used to be frequent domestic quarrels, local residents said. Ajay and Radha were married two years ago. During the search, her family members found Radha's body in a septic tank near the house. The news of the horrific discovery soon spread and hundreds of tea garden workers gathered outside the house. The mob then dragged out Ajay and attacked him, accusing him of killing his wife and daughter. His mother Jamuna was also not spared as the mob attacked the duo with bamboo splinters and rods. Even the police who arrived shortly afterwards did not dare to intervene after seeing the fury of the mob. In a video of the incident, which was taken on a phone camera and has since gone viral on social media, a group of people are seen attacking the mother and the son, who have fallen to the ground.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that heavy rain is very likely to occur at isolated places over Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura from Tuesday morning. The arrival of the monsoon in the region is likely to cause heavy rain in isolated places in Assam and Meghalaya from Wednesday onwards, the forecast said. Officials at the Guwahati-based Regional Meteorological Centre of the IMD said the advancement of the monsoon towards Assam may be delayed by a couple of days. Several areas in Assam have been reeling from hot and humid conditions over the last one week. But moderate rain, accompanied by thunder-showers is very likely to occur at many places over Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on Tuesday. Arunachal Pradesh will also experience light to moderate rain in the next 24 hours. \"The Southwest monsoon will further advance to other northeastern states in the coming days. Climatologically, monsoon arrives in some parts of northeast on June 1 and covers the entire region by June 5. But this year, the arrival was delayed by about 10 days. Usually, it takes five days for the rains to cover the entire region. So it will take some more time before the rains cover the whole of the region,\" RMC deputy director general of meteorology Sanjay O'Neill Shaw told TOI. Met officials said, till the monsoon covers the entire region, mercury will keep going up. Assam recorded the highest temperature of 36.4 degree Celsius in Guwahati on Monday, followed by Agartala at 36.3 degree Celsius. The IMD evening weather bulletin on Monday stated that the SW monsoon has further advanced into the remaining parts of the south Arabian Sea and Lakshadweep, most parts of Kerala, some more parts of Tamil Nadu and Bay of Bengal, most parts of Mizoram and some parts of Manipur. Weathermen said the arrival of the monsoon is heartening for the region as most of the states here received deficit rainfall during the pre-monsoon season. Except for Assam and Meghalaya-the only two states in NE which received 2% and 9% rain above normal in the pre-monsoon season-the rest of the five states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura-experienced deficit rainfall in the pre-monsoon season.

The field study was conducted between July 2017 and February 2018. The report's socioeconomic survey section said that all the 46 people who were asked with the several questionnaires on the proposed project were categorically against construction of the dam. \"All of them who were interviewed were aware of the construction of the dam. Not a single person agreed to the construction of the dam. This is because the dam will nearly submerge a large part of the area, including settlements of the people and 13th century stupa, the Gorzam Chorten, which has great cultural and historical significance,\" the report released late last month said. Zemithang valley in Tawang district has a population of 2,805 in 12 villages. Buddhist Monpas are the predominant community in the district. The Monpas also in West Kameng district of the state reveres black-necked cranes that breed in Ladakh and China as an embodiment of the sixth Dalai Lama who was born in 1683 in Tawang that borders with China's Tibet. The locals who call the bird as Trung-Trung Karmo, considers the arrival of black-necked cranes as norbu (good fortune). Further, the report said people interviewed were aware of the fact that hunting was not allowed in the Black-necked cranes' wintering habitat due to the \"local religious belief\" of the Monpas. \"Only a few of the people had heard about one death, which had been caused by some outsiders,\" the report said. The three kilometer stretch of Nyamjang Chhu (river in Monpa language) between Brojenthang and Zemithang in the valley is one of the two wintering sites of black-necked cranes in India. The other site is Sangti, also in Arunachal Pradesh. The wintering site in Nyamjang Chhu also overlapped with the barrage for the proposed 780 MW hydro-electric project. WII's report has categorically said that the construction of the dam would \"eventually submerge the entire habitat of vulnerable black-necked crane in Zemithang.\" It said that the sample group consisted of young to middle-aged people \"who have been observing the cranes only from the recent past.\" \"But a few of the elders had answered about their (Black-necked cranes) presence from the early 20th century. This shows that the area has been used by Black-necked cranes as a critical wintering site for a very long period of time,\" the report said. Monks who under the banner of Save Mon Region Federation (SMRF) has been protesting against Nyamjang Chhu and 12 other hydro-electric projects in Tawang took the WII's report as a \"moral victory\" of their movement. The WII report is an outcome of a 2016 order by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that suspended the environmental clearance given to the project and asked the environment ministry to conduct a study on the environmental impact of the project. In 2012 SMRF challenged in NGT the environmental clearance granted to Nyamjang Chhu on the ground that the project developer did not reveal the wintering site of black-necked crane in the environment impact assessment (EIA) report commissioned by the project developer.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

We have successfully completed three years of our government in the state. Our vision is to win more than 100 (out of the 126) seats in the assembly polls.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Through the campaign, launched on a Facebook page reportedly by a few people from West Bengal and Assam recently, the group is inviting Assamese-speaking people to mention their mother tongue as Bengali during the next Census to be held in 2021. The social media group is allegedly targeting people from the riverine areas of Assam whose parents were Bengali speakers but have gradually endorsed Assamese as their mother tongue. Top leaders of the literary body met chief secretary Alok Kumar on Tuesday, urging him to take prompt action against such plans to create unrest on linguistic lines. Talking to the media here on Wednesday, Sabha president Paramananda Rajbongshi said Assamese and Bengali languages have their roots in the old Kamrupi language that is spoken in the present-day Assam Valley. It also clarified that alongwith Assamese, it's is equally accountable to safeguard the Bengali language, which is loved by the people of Assam. \"An evil force is working behind the scenes on the social media. This can lead our society towards a linguistic conflict and create misunderstanding between people of the two communities. Raising concern over such a conspiracy, the Sabha has urged the Assam government to uproot such unholy elements,\" said Rajbongshi. \"Kumar assured our delegation that the government will take stringent action against elements trying to disrupt peace and harmony in the state through mischievous campaigns,\" added Rajbongshi. He said the 'Chalo Paltai' campaign will automatically die down if the Assam government and regional organizations extend support to the Sabha's endeavour to promote Assamese language among the residents of char areas, adivasis and tea tribes, who are willing to accept Assamese as their mother tongue and lingua franca in the 2021 census. \"The Sabha is in touch with the people living in the char areas as well as the tea tribes and adivasis. They have assured us to endorse Assamese as their mother tongue and lingua franca. It's now clear that Assamese-speaking people won't be reduced to a minority in the next census as feared earlier. If the Assam government and other regional organizations support our initiative, the percentage of Assamese speaking population may go up to 70% in the 2021 census,\" said Rajbongshi.

The chief minister strongly vouched for Niti Aayog's intervention to include river erosion in the list of calamities for funding under the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) or SDRF so that quick and timely steps can be taken. Thanking the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for setting up a high-level committee for the proper management of water resources in the northeast under the chairmanship of the vice-chairman of the Niti Aayog, Sonowal said suggestions made in the draft report of the committee would go a long way in finding a permanent solution to the problems of floods and erosion in Assam. The chief minister said the state government had made progress in addressing the needs of the seven selected aspirational districts of the state and an amount of Rs 28 crore had been set aside in the state budget of the current financial year for taking up new activities. He also referred to Hailakandi district's achievement of being ranked first among the aspirational districts in India for which Rs 10 crore was awarded to the district. Sonowal highlighted the state government's endeavour to distribute land patta to one lakh farmer families in the current financial year. In order to achieve Prime Minister Modi's target of doubling farm income by 2022 in the state, satisfactory results were showed by the CM's Samagra Gramya Unnayan Yojana that was launched by the state government in 2017 with an outlay of Rs 30,000, the statement said.

Without resorting to complete cessation of services, the doctors' fraternity at AMC, which is the first medical college in the northeast, have been protesting against the assault on fellow doctors in Kolkata on Tuesday. The protests at AMC are being held under the banner of the Junior Doctors' Association, Assam Medical College Students' Association, the Dibrugarh branch of Indian Medical Association and Assam Medical College Teachers' Association. AMC has decided to participate in the nationwide 24-hour strike called by the Indian Medical Association on June 17. Except for emergency services which have been exempted from the strike, non-emergency services and routine diagnostic services will remain suspended during the period, AMC sources said on Saturday. \"Like West Bengal, medical colleges in Assam lack proper safety measures. The basic minimum we can ask for is the permanent placement of security personnel at places which have a high patient turnover, like casualty departments. Security is of utmost importance for doctors to avoid taking risks or even trying invasive life-saving procedures for fear of physical assault if such procedures lead to complications,\" said Sauradeep Dey, a junior resident doctor at the department of general surgery at AMC. \"We hope that the Kolkata incident will pave the way for proper screening measures such as preventing drunk or rowdy attendants from entering the patient management zone and quick redressal of grievances of patients and their attendants by additional hospital personnels. On-duty doctors, overburdened with looking after patients, often fail to provide fast solutions to these grievances, leading to miscommunication between patients and their families,\" a junior doctor said. Doctors across the country have been staging protests since two junior doctors were seriously injured after being attacked at NRS Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata on June 10.

This year, an estimated 25 lakh devotees are expected,\" said Baruah.

All the four camps will have 20% more capacity for accommodating devotees. The four camps will be at Fancy Bazar, Old Pandu railway station, Boripara and Naherbari at the Kamakhya Temple.

The bench of Justices Manojit Bhuyan and Prasanta Kumar Deka ordered that Sanaullah, 52, be released on bail after furnishing a bail bond of Rs 20,000 with two local sureties. The court directed him not to move out of the territorial limits of Kamrup district without the prior approval of superintendent of police. The bench has also directed the authorities to obtain the biometrics of Sanaullah before releasing him. Challenging the tribunal's order, which he described as 'arbitrary, perverse and illegal', Sanaullah had moved the HC on May 31. He had also filed an interlocutory application, seeking his release from detention.  Sanaullah retired from the Army in 2017 as an honourary lieutenant after which he had joined Assam Police as an assistant sub-inspector.  In September 2018, proceedings against Sanaullah under Foreigners' Act were initiated on the basis of a 2008 report of Assam Border Police, the same wing of Assam Police in which Sanaullah later worked, to the tribunal that he was an 'illegal migrant' .  Border Police officer Chandramal Das, who had inquired and reported that Sanaullah was an illegal foreigner, had mentioned his profession as 'labourer' in the 2008 report.  It also incorporated a purported 'confessional statement' of Sanaullah that he had illegally entered India 'through a secret route' for better living. The inquiry officer has also mentioned in his report that Sanaullah's wife and his two children were 'suspected nationals'. But Sanaullah, in his petition, submitted that the tribunal's order did not mention that he had served in the Indian Army from 1987 to 2017. He further stated that no inquiry officer visited his house and that no notice had ever been served on him. He maintained that the inquiry report was completely false and fabricated.

Assam, which was once rich in freshwater turtles, but habitat loss and over-exploitation - they were once a popular local food - have massively depleted their population. The black softshell turtle was declared extinct in the wild in 2002 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while the Indian softshell turtle and the Indian peacock softshell turtle are classified as vulnerable. But all the while, the pond of the Hayagriva Madhav temple in the Hajo pilgrimage centre has provided a safe haven to them, thanks to the sacred status of turtles protecting them from harm. \"There are plenty of turtles in the temple pond,\" said Jayaditya Purkayastha, from conservation group 'Good Earth'. The group has teamed up with the temple authorities in a breeding programme. \"The population of the turtle in Assam has gone down by a great extent. So we thought we needed to intervene and do something to save the species from extinction,\" he said. In January, his organisation's first batch of 35 turtle hatchlings, including 16 black softshells hand-reared at the temple, was released into a nearby wildlife sanctuary. A key figure is the caretaker of the temple pond, Pranab Malakar, who long before environmentalists became involved took a keen interest in the turtles' wellbeing. \"I used to take care of them as I like them. Later, after I became associated with Good Earth, it became my responsibility,\" he said. \"No one harms them here as they are incarnations of Lord Vishnu (a Hindu deity). I was born and grew up here. We have been seeing the turtles since our childhood. People respect them,\" he said. Malakar collects eggs laid by the turtles on the sandy banks of the pond - a new concrete bank had to be demolished a few years ago - and gingerly puts them into an incubator. The project has been so successful that Good Earth has identified 18 other temple ponds in the area which could also be used for similar initiatives. But it is not without its challenges. For one thing, some of the hundreds of daily visitors to the temple outside Guwahati throw bread and other food to the turtles - which they clearly like. \"This has triggered some biological changes among the turtles in the pond. They have also lost their natural tendency of hunting for food,\" Purkayastha said.

The Union home ministry, in a gazette notification of May 30, said an applicant shall provide a certified copy of the rejection order received from the NRC authorities along with the grounds for appeal. However, the notification added that persons against whom the foreigners tribunals have 'already given opinion' earlier as foreigner will not be eligible to file appeals. Also, persons against whom 'reference' has already been made by the competent authority to any FT shall not be eligible to file appeals before the tribunal, the notification said. \"The appellant may appear either in person or through a legal practitioner or a relation authorized by the appellant in writing, subject to the acceptance of such representation by the tribunal,\" the notification said. It added that the tribunal shall issue a notice to the district magistrate to produce NRC records within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice and a copy of the notice shall also be sent to the pleader appearing for the government and also the appellant. The state government may appoint a pleader to represent the district magistrate. The notification said the district magistrate 'may also refer to the tribunal' for its opinion on whether the appellant is a foreigner or not. \"Upon production of records, if the tribunal finds merit in the appeal, it shall issue notice to the appellant and the district magistrate for hearing, specifying the date of hearing and such date shall be within thirty days from the date of production of the records,\" the notification said. It added that the final order of the tribunal shall contain its opinion on whether the appellant is eligible for inclusion in the NRC or not. The All Assam Minority Students' Union (AAMSU), one of the stakeholders in the NRC case in the Supreme Court, said the central government issued the gazette notification without holding any consultations with the stakeholders. \"Had there been consultation with the stakeholders prior to the issuance of gazette notification, we would have given our inputs for necessary amendments. We will soon meet chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, as well as the Union home secretary, with our demands,\" said Aamsu adviser Azizur Rahman. The names of 40.07 lakh people were excluded from the final draft NRC that was released on July 30 last year. Those who have been exluded include 'declared foreigners', doubtful 'D' voters and their family members. However, over 30 lakh people of 40.07 lakh have filed claims for inclusion in the final NRC.

Police fear the racket may be targeting domestic elephants for their tusks. A top state police official said, \"There are hundreds of domesticated jumbos in the state and many of them have their tusks intact. Usually, the forest department keeps a track of these animals, but in many cases, owners sell off tusks for money.\" Sources added that despite the department seizing tusks of domesticated elephants after their deaths as a precautionary measure, there were allegations that many owners did not inform the department about the deaths of their elephants and sold off the tusks. \"About a third of the length of the tusk lies inside the elephant's skull, which is why ivory hunters kill the elephant instead of just cutting off the tusk. There were reports that sometimes procedures of tusk seizures were also not followed carefully and portions of the tusk were left in the body enabling illegal traders to have their fill,\" said sources. Recently, the Golaghat police recovered a tusk, weighing around 2.8 kg and nabbed one person involved in ivory smuggling from Matikhola, bordering Jorhat, about 305 km from here. \"Investigators have been looking for records of elephant-hunt in nearby areas, including the Kaziranga National Park. However, no such incident was reported recently. There is a possibility that the recovered tusk was the tusk of a domesticated elephant, whose death was not reported,\" the police said. Earlier in January, in a joint operation, Customs and the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau sleuths had seized six pieces of elephant tusks in an operation in Udalguri district. The tusks weighed around 13 kg with an approximate value of Rs 1.5 crores in the international market. Besides traditional medicines, tusks are used in making jewellery, billiards balls, piano keys, identification chops and many other items of luxury.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets.

At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught.

Around 40,000 TET-qualified teachers are working on a contractual basis in the state now, with the government\u2019s decision to hold the test again in September this year having raised concerns among those instructors who have previously cleared the examination but are still awaiting regularization. Working president of the organization, Troloikya Deka, has appealed to chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal to regularize the services of the TET-qualified teachers, who have been working on a contractual basis with the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan for years now.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option.

Sanaullah, the retired Army personnel, was sent to a detention centre for illegal foreigners after being declared as an illegal foreigner on May 23. His family members say that Sanaullah is an Indian citizen and there are documents to prove it. After retiring from the Army, Sanaullah joined the Assam Police's border wing as a sub-inspector. On Saturday, retired police sub-inspector (border) Chandramal Das, who was earlier engaged in recording statements of 'doubtful' citizens, claimed that the former Army officer was not the Md Sanaullah he had examined on May 23, 2008. \"The person whose statement I recorded was a daily wager. His name was also Md Sanaullah. He was illiterate and this why his thumb impression is there on the statement. The person who has been sent to the detention camp is not the one whose statement I had recorded. A person who served in the Army would not be illiterate and also wouldn't give a thump impression,\" Das told TOI. Challenging Das's statement, Aman Wadud, the retired Army officer's advocate, said, \"It cannot be a case of mistaken identity. It was, rather, a deliberate attempt to harass people in the name of detecting foreigners.\" He added, \"The inquiry officer in this case never met Md Sanaullah. The truth is there is no other person by the name of Sanaullah, son of Mohammed Ali, in that village (Kalahikash). This is a case of deliberate and malafide targeting of people in the guise of detecting foreigners. It is not an isolated case, it has become a regular affair now. Border Police randomly accuse people of being foreigners without conducting any investigation.\" Wadud has chalenged the tribunal's decision in the Gauhati high court. The address of Md Sanaullah, whose statement was recorded by the Border Police in 2008, is uncannily same as that of the retired Army officer. The address that was mentioned in the statement was Kalahikash at Boko in Kamrup district, which is also the address of the retired Army officer. Senior advocate Hafiz Rashid Choudhury said hundreds of people suffered after being tagged as 'doubtful' voters and 'foreigners' because of improper and lackadaisical investigation by the Border Police. \"Many of the victims are poor. People are made to suffer because of poor inquiry on the field,\" added Choudhury.

The last round of harassment occurred after cops at a police station \u201crefused to register her complaint\u201d but, instead, referred her to the \u201cright police station\u201d.   Cops from Bhowanipore arrived around 10-15 minutes later. It was past midnight by then and Sengupta decided to pursue the case on Tuesday morning and requested the cabby to drop her colleague and her off at their homes. But the nightmare was far from being over. \u201cThe boys had followed us till my colleague\u2019s house and, right when we were dropping him at Lake Gardens, six of them on three bikes came and stopped the car. They pelted stones, smashing the window. They then dragged me out and tried to break my phone to delete the video. Luckily, local people heard my cries for help and came out. The boys then fled,\u201d Sengupta recalled.   She then called her father and sister; her own residence was just a lane away. They called cops, who came and asked her to file an FIR at the Charu Market police station. It was 1.30 a.m. when she reached there but, instead of taking down her complaint, the cops there directed her to Bhowanipore police station where the first assault had occured. \u201cI just gave up and started shouting at this point. There was no female police officer. The officer there finally took down my complaint after asking a lot of questions but refused to take the cabby\u2019s complaint, stating that two FIR could not be taken for the same incident,\u201d she said. Frustrated and hapless, she returned home. It was at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday that she posted the entire ordeal on Facebook along with a 20-second video clip. An additional CP later called Sengupta and assured her of strong action against not just the accused but an inquiry into police refusal to take her complaint citing jurisdiction issues. \u201cThe probe has just begun and we have identified all the culprits. More arrests are likely and we will probe whether there was lack of adequate response from cops,\u201d said a Lalbazar official. The arrested were identified as Sheikh Rahit, Fardeen Khan, Sheikh Shabir Ali, Sheikh Gani, Sheikh Imran Ali, Sheikh Wasim and Atif Khan alias Md Samsad. A preliminary inquiry revealed the cab had accidentally brushed against the bike, causing the riders to lose balance. One of the bikes\u2019 rear view mirrors broke and the youths accosted cabby Tarak Debnath to demand compensation. At least two more bikes and an auto carrying more people landed there, leading to the sequence of events ending with the assault at Lake Gardens, officials said.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. He defeated Congress's Ramnaraian Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently concluded general election. He has also been elected to Rajasthan assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. Birla will succeed eight-term MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this will not be for the first time a relative newcomer will hold the position. In 1996, TDP leader G M C Balayogi was also a two-time MP when he was elected as the LS Speaker and after his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and the first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

On Wednesday, admission was held for afternoon shift BA courses in the college, where the cutoff came down to 80.5 percent for general category students. B Borooah College principal Satyendra Nath Barman said based on preference and merit of the students, the allotment of major courses for various subjects will be done at a later stage. Cotton University academic registrar Sanjay Dutta said advancing the admission schedule in the university this year has led to a marginal rise in cutoffs, which was evident during the admissions held over the last two days. \"This year, Cotton University admission was held much earlier compared to the previous years. As a result, many students who may have been eyeing seats in Delhi University-affiliated colleges have taken admission here as there is no assurance of seats in the leading colleges of Delhi. We believe that this is a factor behind the rise in cut-offs on an average,\" he said. Traditionally, chemistry and Physics have recorded high cut-off scores in Cotton University. Around 4,800 students applied for various BSc and BA major courses in Cotton University this year. For the BSc programmes, the university received about 1900 applications.

With an average of 32 cases of 'cruelty by husband' on a daily basis, Assam recorded 12,000 cases of domestic violence in 2018. Every year, the number of domestic violence cases recorded have continued to surpass its previous years' figures. Recently released official records by the Assam Police show an increase in instances of domestic abuse from some 2200 cases recorded across the state in 2005 to 11,999 in 2018. According to the official records, the same figure was 10,580 in 2017 and 9327 in 2016. An alarming number of cases relating to dowry-induced violence are also on the rise. Police records informed: \"Another 166 women were allegedly killed by their in-laws for dowry in 2018. The numbers of dowry-related murders are also increasing in the state.

However, the police department attributed the high numbers to a growing awareness of women's safety as well as to a growing number of 'false' cases reported. \"In many cases, we have also found the victim allegedly misusing the law,\" said a senior police officer.
