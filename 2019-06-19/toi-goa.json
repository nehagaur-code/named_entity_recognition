While this may be the most delayed monsoon in a decade, the IMD had earlier forecast that monsoon would hit Goa between June 12-15. Though the monsoon arrived in Kerala, there is no further progress as of now. \u201cOur analysis shows it will take four to five days for the monsoon to hit Goa. It may vary. Regarding the monsoon onset statistics, we have to check our records for further clarification on whether it is the most delayed monsoon in the last two decades or not. We expect the monsoon to progress upwards in a few days towards the north of the peninsula,\u201d IMD director, K V Padgalwar said. The department has attributed the delay in the monsoon in Goa to cyclone Vayu absorbing moisture from the west coast before taking it along towards the north of the peninsula. The delay has also increased the rain deficit further. As of now, Padgalwar said, the conditions for the monsoon are not favourable. \u201cAny trough visible in the western coast is known as an off-shore trough. Currently, there is no off-shore trough here. The depression in the Bay of Bengal is not moving either. It is stagnated there for the past four to five days, its position is the same,\u201d he said. Parts of the state experienced cloudy weather on Tuesday. The department this to south westerly winds bringing in moisture, thus developing clouds. But this moisture is not enough to result in rain. The weather alert cautioning fishermen from venturing into the seas is still active as a result. \u201cThe information provided from buoys has reported winds blowing at 20-30 knots. It\u2019s not advisable for fishermen to venture into the sea.\u201d Padgalwar said.

The protests began after a couple of the age-old trees were felled, and activists tried to save the rest. Alongside Sardesai were historian Prajal Sakhardande, social activist Patricia Pinto, and others. After the protests, the citizens made their way to the Panaji police station to file a complaint.

They also wanted to know why CCP shrugged off all responsibility and refused to intervene. Meanwhile, Sakhardande said that they would not allow any more trees to be cut at the site.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option. We need to see how this will pan out.\" In Video:Bill seeking to lift green card cap amended to protect US workersDownload The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."}, "Online petition in favour of GoaMiles gains momentum": {"datetime": "", "time": "2019-06-19 04:10:00", "description": "PANAJI: Over 8,500 people have signed an online petition in support of GoaMiles. Facing flak from local taxi services and politicians since its inception last August, GoaMiles, an app-based cab service operating with state-approved tariffs, has received support online. The initiative by Goa Tourism Development Corporation was a result of Goa being a victim to uncontrolled rates for taxi services, especially at places like the airport and local taxi stands, the petition states. It adds that GoaMiles has been facing fictional news about employment of non-Goans as its taxi drivers. \u201cThis falsely put together news by a handful of people is the main reason overpowering all the good,\u201d the petition adds. Locals and tourists who have signed the petition express displeasure with local taxis not using meters and not supporting the metered initiative the app contains. The comments in support of the initiative range from \u201cAbsolutely necessary\u201d and \u201cNeed of the moment\u201d, to \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason to not have metered taxis\u201d and \u201cDown with taxi union that is preying on the people of Goa\u201d. \u201cBecause I believe that by not allowing even meters to be put in the taxies, the local cabwalas are taking not only tourists but Goans for a ride. The state government relents to them because they happen to be a huge vote bank,\u201d one signatory stated. Another related how citizens are at the mercy of cab drivers. \u201cThe biggest hurdle I face when visiting Goa is public transportation, which means you have to rely on private cabs. And every cab driver wants to become an Ambani or Adani in one ride. They name it and you have to shell it out. That\u2019s the reason they didn\u2019t allow Ola or Uber in Goa. The cab drivers are a bunch of thugs.\u201d A local said she has experienced how difficult and expensive it is to travel by taxi in Goa. \u201cDespite being locals, we ourselves are fleeced whenever we need to travel short distances.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

A good show here could bring Goa its third or maybe fourth IM title in 2019. Defending champion Idani Pouya of Iran, seeded sixth, will look to hold on to his crown. With 2597 Elo points, he will have tough competition from top seed Eduardo Iturrizaga of Venezuela (Elo 2637). The 29-year-old GM will be looking to get over his disappointing run at last week\u2019s Mayor\u2019s Cup International Chess tournament, Mumbai, where he finished 13th. Georgia\u2019s second seed Levan Pantsulaia (2614) may have something to prove again as he took the third place in the Mumbai event. The A category tournament will offer players a chance to earn more Elo points and norms as the cut-off list is set at 2,000 points. \u201cLast year, we had kept A category open to all. Though, it was a popular move, it didn\u2019t offer much to players in terms of Elo points and norms. This year we decided to make it more competitive so that elite players will play more competitive chess,\u201d said GCA secretary Kishor Bandekar. Though Gukesh, Ritviz and Nitish will be up against the likes of Pantsulaia, Ter-Sahakyan Samvel (Armenia), former U-18 World champion Mikheil Mchedlishvili (Georgia) and India\u2019s Abhijeet Gupta, Deepan Chakkravarthy, few good results will boost their confidence. Bhakti Kulkarni, who became Goa\u2019s latest International Master, will be missing in action following her participation in the Asian Continental Open and Women\u2019s Championship in Xingtai, China.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. He defeated Congress's Ramnaraian Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently concluded general election. He has also been elected to Rajasthan assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. Birla will succeed eight-term MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this will not be for the first time a relative newcomer will hold the position. In 1996, TDP leader G M C Balayogi was also a two-time MP when he was elected as the LS Speaker and after his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and the first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

We had made all arrangements to remove the waste from inside the plant by engaging men and machinery through the night.\" While nearly 1,000 tonnes of reject lies inside the plant, sources said MMC managed to clear around 70 tonnes of waste on Tuesday. \"That's not enough free space to allow daily incoming waste into the plant. The entire volume of reject needs to be moved out before any more waste can be treated,\" said Sudin Raiturkar of Fomento, who has been monitoring the situation at Sonsoddo. Sources said that going by rough estimates, it will take a few more days for MMC to clear the plant of all the reject. The MMC, with no other place to dump the reject,has found itself in a piquant situation. Sources said that the recent fire at the Sonsoddo garbage dump led to the current crisis. While the reject from the plant would eventually find its way into the old garbage dump, protests by locals led to Fomento dumping the reject inside the plant until there was no enough space to handle incoming garbage. That was when Fomento blocked entry to MMC's garbage trucks on Monday. Sardesai, who visited Sonsoddo on Tuesday morning, said that he would ensure that things fall in place soon. He blamed both MMC and Fomento for taking a \"bureaucratic approach\" to the issue. \"Garbage is rotting on the streets, and MMC and Fomento are playing volleyball throwing the ball in each others' courts. They need to have a hands-on approach. I am not going to tolerate garbage rotting on the streets in my constituency (Fatorda),\" Sardesai said. MMC has now begun scouting for open plots of land to be used for segregation of mixed waste before moving it to Sonsoddo. While it has identified a place in Fatorda, councillors from Curtorim and Margao wards have been asked to identify places for the purpose, sources said. \"People have demanded that only segregated waste should come to Sonsoddo,\" Sardesai said. \"Fomento is also demanding segregated waste. I am also of the same view. But the question is where do we segregate mixed waste. There are black spots in Margao, Cutorim and Fatorda where mixed waste is dumped, which goes to Sonsoddo. So let the MLAs from Margao and Curtorim identify and give lands for segregation just as I have done in Fatorda.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/not-enough-space-for-more-waste-fomento/articleshow/69852028.cms"}, "Lok Sabha Elections in Tamil Nadu": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections-2019/tamil-nadu/news/lok-sabha-elections-in-tamil-nadu-top-contenders-and-key-constituencies/articleshow/68610103.cms?", "description": "NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu goes to polls in the second phase of the seven-phase elections.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

The excitement is understandable as the Goa opener will be the only player from the state to feature in the National Cricket Academy (NCA) One-day cricket tournament in Mysuru.

She scored 187 runs in six innings, hitting two half-centuries and helping Goa win three matches. It was not easy for her. The Class 12 commerce student of Dnyan Prasarak Mandal, Mapusa, had examination dates clashing with tournaments. \u201cAfter our first two matches, I came to Goa to appear for the examinations and then went back. Though it was a great outing for me, we failed to reach the knockout stage,\u201d she said. It is never easy being an opener and Purvaja knows the challenges that await her in Mysuru. \u201cI will not be surprised if I have to open the innings under cloudy sky and the ball does all sorts of things. I remember the first time playing under such weather conditions and I faced India pacer Mansi Joshi. I had no clue how the first five balls zoomed past. I missed all and was bowled out on the last ball. But I have learnt from that experience and I am training hard to ensure I do better this time around,\u201d said Purvaja Goa Cricket Association\u2019s move to host Women's U-19 one-day tournament in February prior to Women\u2019s U-23 tournament at Rajkot also helped Purvaja. \u201cPlaying at home was a good thing.

While there is no mechanism in place to segregate and treat the waste that it generates, dust bins, which were provided a while ago, haven\u2019t been installed yet. Treatable food waste is buried in pits, but how it treats its plastic and other inert waste remains a mystery. Neither the Colvale village panchayat nor Mapusa municipality picks up its waste. \u201cThere is no system in place to treat plastic and other non-biodegradable waste,\" said a source. Interestingly, a few metres away along the highway, there\u2019s a fresh garbage dump. The spot, once clean, is now littered with all kinds of waste courtesy hotels, grocery shops and stalls. Here, too, both the Colvale and Mapusa civic bodies wash their hands off. The Colvale central jail generates 250-300kg of waste a day. Sources in the locality say that it\u2019s possible some of it finds its way to the roadside dump. Additional inspector general of prisons (IGP) Ajit Panchwadkar told TOI that the Goa Solid Waste Management Corporation (GSWMC) will soon train guards and other staffers in waste management. \u201cSoon, we will scientifically segregate and dispose waste,\u201d he said, emphasising that they consider it \u201can important task\u201d.

Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

With the civic body having no alternative place to dispose the rejects, the garbage-laden trucks remained without being offloaded the entire day. The issue figured in the Margao Municipal Council meeting held later in the day with chairperson Babita Angle Prabhudessai expressing her anguish over the development. \u201cFomento expressed its inability to accept any more incoming garbage for processing, as the rejects (which earlier would find its way into the garbage dump) had piled up inside the plant, leaving no space for incoming daily waste. We have no other space for dumping rejects. Fomento is holding the entire city to ransom,\u201d she said. Fomento has already issued a notice of termination to the MMC to pull out of the concession agreement signed between it and the civic body over setting up the solid waste management plant. A meeting of Fomento Green and MMC is likely to be held on Tuesday. Prabhudessai said she hoped that some solution would emerge from the meeting. The issue of \u201cRenderzyme treatment\u201d proving ineffective in controlling the fire and smoke at Sonsoddo was raised during the meeting. The MMC chairperson said that MMC had ordered the organic solution on fire and emergency services\u2019 recommendation. Significantly, councillors were seen divided over their political affiliations over the issue of garbage. The usually reticent councillor Suchita Malkarnekar alleged that while Fatorda wards were given preferential treatment, \u201cinjustice\u201d was meted out to Margao wards. She said that door-to-door collection of waste from wards I to XI of Fatorda had been outsourced to a private agency which has been doing a satisfactory job, and asked why the MMC failed to put in place a similar system for the wards in Margao. The MMC is under control of deputy chief minister Vijai Sardesai, who represents Fatorda constituency, while Margao MLA Digambar Kamat\u2019s influence over the civic body is on the wane. \u201cI had contested the municipality elections on the garbage issue assuring my voters of solving the problem. Now with hardly a year left for our term to end, nothing seems to be happening beyond wards I to XI. This is injustice to Margao wards,\u201d Malkarnekar said.

They will be a paid a salary of Rs 40,000 per month. The new scheme will be implemented from the current academic year itself, officials said.

D\u2019Souza, considered to be one of the finest officers in the state administration, served as additional secretary (finance) for over a decade, and also as additional secretary to the chief minister. He has now been posted as additional secretary (housing) with additional charge of director (training), Goa Institute of Public administration and Rural Development (GIPARD). This is the first major bureaucratic reshuffle of officers of the Goa civil services since chief minister Pramod Sawant took over the reigns of the state in March. Sources said that a few ministers had repeatedly complained against D\u2019Souza during the past one year, as he perused through proposals referred to his department with a fine-tooth comb. It had resulted in some objectionable proposals either being kept on hold or delayed. When Parrikar was at the helm, the complaints of these ministers were shown the bin. However, the demand for his ouster from the finance department grew considerably after Parrikar\u2019s demise. In February, some ministers, including health minister Vishwajit Rane and revenue minister Rohan Khaunte, had alleged at a cabinet meeting chaired by Parrikar at his private residence in Dona Pauala that D\u2019Souza was \u201cobstructing development\u201d by not clearing files. Sources said that Parrikar had specifically instructed the finance department not to clear files under pressure from his ministerial colleagues unless they vetted the proposals. Finance department\u2019s objections to inflated rates for items listed in tenders had resulted in the ministers concerned taking up cudgels against D\u2019Souza. The file then used to go to Parrikar, and he would stand by the finance department\u2019s notings. A political observer said that it now seems like the chief minister has succumbed to pressure from ministers who wanted him to transfer D\u2019Souza. \u201cD\u2019Souza is not the only officer, but there are complaints from some minisers of \u2018non-cooperation\u201d, sources said.

Every structure, whether residential, commercial, government and even utilities will be mapped this time to ensure that land utilization is clearly depicted in the ODP. The planning body will also identify encroachments on government and private land. Lobo, however, did not specify what action will be taken against such encroachments. \u201cThere is a lot of land touching the river where there are encroachments. There is land which has been used for various government projects which otherwise on the plan is shown as orchard or vacant land. We need to specify what it has been used for,\u201d Lobo said. NGPDA will begin the process by issuing a public notice inviting objections and suggestions from the public. The entire process to map the structures in Mapusa and Panaji will be contracted to a private agency which will then prepare the land use map. This time around, Lobo said, NGPDA has also decided to get on board councillors from the local municipal bodies. Lobo has urged the Corporation of the City of Panaji and the Mapusa Municipal Council to help NGPDA with the drafting process. \u201cWe will come up with a tender notice to see that we take an agency on board to mark all these structures and give us a ready map.

Dikshit is not that important leader.\u201d Kejriwal has been urging the Congress to stitch an alliance in Delhi for the Lok Sabha polls to keep the BJP away from power. Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.

As the crisis plunged deeper, Margao Muncipal Council (MMC) was found grappling for solutions. Fomento has refused to accept incoming garbage into Sonsoddo until the \u201creject\u201d accumulated in the plant are disposed by the municipality. Fomento and the MMC were headed for a collision course as the civic body, upon the instructions of the deputy chief minister, Vijai Sardesai, was preparing to file a police complaint against Fomento for obstructing its garbage management exercise. \u201cThey are obstructing our work of clearing the rejects piled up inside the plant,\u201d chief officer of MMC Siddhivinayak Naik told TOI. \u201cOn one hand, they are demanding that we cart away the rejects to make space for incoming waste, and on the other, they are preventing us from lifting the waste by shutting the gates of the plant by 6pm. We had made all arrangements to remove the waste from inside the plant by engaging men and machinery through the night.\u201d While nearly 1,000 tonnes of reject lies inside the plant, sources said MMC managed to clear around 70 tonnes of waste on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough free space to allow daily incoming waste into the plant. The entire volume of reject needs to be moved out before any more waste can be treated,\u201d said Sudin Raiturkar of Fomento, who has been monitoring the situation at Sonsoddo. Sources said that going by rough estimates, it will take a few more days for MMC to clear the plant of all the reject. The MMC, with no other place to dump the reject,has found itself in a piquant situation. Sources said that the recent fire at the Sonsoddo garbage dump led to the current crisis. While the reject from the plant would eventually find its way into the old garbage dump, protests by locals led to Fomento dumping the reject inside the plant until there was no enough space to handle incoming garbage. That was when Fomento blocked entry to MMC\u2019s garbage trucks on Monday. Sardesai, who visited Sonsoddo on Tuesday morning, said that he would ensure that things fall in place soon. He blamed both MMC and Fomento for taking a \u201cbureaucratic approach\u201d to the issue. \u201cGarbage is rotting on the streets, and MMC and Fomento are playing volleyball throwing the ball in each others\u2019 courts.

While it has identified a place in Fatorda, councillors from Curtorim and Margao wards have been asked to identify places for the purpose, sources said. \u201cPeople have demanded that only segregated waste should come to Sonsoddo,\u201d Sardesai said. \u201cFomento is also demanding segregated waste. I am also of the same view. But the question is where do we segregate mixed waste. There are black spots in Margao, Cutorim and Fatorda where mixed waste is dumped, which goes to Sonsoddo.

Addressing a meeting in Guntur on Monday, Pawan said that the future of the state did not mean the future of Lokesh and Jagan but it was the future of the people. \u201cThe space on the state\u2019s political stage is not TDP\u2019s and YSRC\u2019s property as youth and women are eager to bring change through Jana Sena.\u201d \u201cTDP had lost moral right to rule the state as chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had no control over his legislators who indulged in illegal activities,\u201d Pawan said adding that he jumped into the political arena to bring in a change in the lives of commoners. \u201cWe supported TDP and BJP in the last elections with a hope to transform the state. Unfortunately, both of them have shattered our dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cGuntur city has been left in a lurch despite located a few kilometres away from the capital city. The entire city has been dug out in the guise of laying underground drainage scheme and left without repair. How shocking it is to see 30 people dying of diarrhoea in a city like Guntur? Is it not the failure of the state government? Opposition leader Jaganmohan Reddy is equally responsible for the tragedy as he never dared to question the government by going to the assembly,\u201d he said. He further said they would construct apartments exclusively for Muslims in the city. He appealed to people to support his candidates Chandrasekhar (Guntur West), Zia-Ur-Rehman (East) and MP candidate Bonaboina Srinivas Yadav in the elections, Pawan said they fielded a BC candidate Srinivasa Yadav whereas TDP and YSRC both have given tickets to their own communities.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Shiv Sena List 2019": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/shiv-sena-announces-21-lok-sabha-candidates-for-maharashtra/articleshow/68523309.cms", "description": "MUMBAI: Shiv Sena has come up with it's first list of 21 candidates, out of 23 to contest in Lok Sabha polls in Maharashtra.

At the Goa Revolution Day celebration in Panaji, Sawant said he \u201cfeels bad\u201d that some politicians encourage the behaviour of those opposing government policies. He also said that he has called for a meeting with the tourism minister and chairman of Goa Tourism Development Corporation to discuss the implementation of the state\u2019s tourism master plan at the earliest. \u201cIt has become a habit for many to go against government policies,\u201d Sawant said. \u201cIf we are going wrong somewhere, point it out and we are open to corrections. I feel bad that some politicians are encouraging such people. After mining, tourism is Goa\u2019s biggest industry. \u2018Athiti devo bhavo\u2019 means our guest should be on par with the divine, for us. At least wait and watch how the implementation of a particular policy is taking shape before protesting. Let me make it clear that nobody should work against the interest of the state. The state\u2019s interest is our first priority. Keep your selfish interests aside.\u201d Though he didn\u2019t directly name taxi operators, his comments were perceived to be pointed at them. Cab operators are currently protesting the app-based GoaMiles service. Sawant also said he would expedite the issuance of sanads to resolve the Mayem evacuee property issue. He was responding to freedom fighter Chandrakant Pednekar, who raised the issue of giving ownership rights to residents of Mayem. Sawant said that he has called for files related to the issue and that he would begin the process of issuing the sanads. Sawant also spoke on the revival of agriculture in Goa, saying that a legislation on community farming is in the offing at the upcoming assembly session. \u201cAgriculture was once the backbone of the state,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the past many years, agriculture has been neglected. Many attempts were made by our last government. But it did not take off as we did not get the necessary cooperation. At the upcoming assembly session, we will address the issue of community farming. We dont want to let our fields lie barren.\u201d Sawant said that he would revise some vocational education programmes offered from Class VIII-XII and, taking the benefit of central government schemes, introduce employment-oriented courses in their place. On mining, the chief minister said he was aware of the difficulties faced by dependants and that he is working on the resumption of mining in the state.
