Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

Data accessed by TOI shows only 114 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) of live storage is available in 13 major reservoirs. The figure is just about 14% of the total storage capacity of 825 tmcft. According to Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC), the water level in three dams, Ghataprabha (1%), Tungabhadra (2%) and Malaprabha (3%), has literally hit rock bottom. KSNDMC director GS Srinivasa Reddy said the present picture is a complete contrast of the previous year\u2019s situation, when some of the reservoirs were full. \u201cLast year, we received ample rain in May itself. Some dams like Kabini were full by this time. This time, the effect of Cyclone Vayu has further delayed the monsoon. Though rain is expected in a few days, it will take another month to see more inflow into reservoirs,\u201d he added. A senior official from KSNDMC explained that the initial weeks of June usually see a lull, though last year was an exception. \u201cRain should have started by the second week at least.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived. Wasn't Priyanka already a daughter of this nation, a daughter of the Congress? And would she not remain so in future?

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

She was accompanied by three others, whose interrogation led Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) sleuths to two kingpins of the drug smuggling cartel. The duo, Abu and Mohammed, are in their mid-20s and belong to Kerala. They were running the India-Qatar drug smuggling ring with Bengaluru as the base. Drugs, including hashish and methamphetamine, were recovered from their hideout in Austin Town. The total value of the seizure is around Rs 3 crore. According to NCB sources, a team led by Bruno A, zonal director (acting) of NCB\u2019s Bengaluru unit, received specific information on a city-based drug cartel looking to recruit carriers to smuggle contraband from Bengaluru to Doha. \u201cWe began investigation a few weeks ago and were finally able to zero in on four gang members on Saturday morning. The three men, who were agents, and the woman were caught in a Karnataka-registered car parked on KIA premises. She had 510gm of methamphetamine and 572 Lyrica (a sedative) capsules in her possession,\u201d said an NCB officer. The sleuths identified the woman as a mule who was scheduled to fly from Bengaluru to Doha on Saturday with a rucksack. \u201cThe three agents had recruited her to smuggle the drugs into Qatar with the promise of good remuneration and free travel,\u201d the officer added. Grilling of the trio led investigators to a house on Linden Street, Austin Town, from where the kingpins were picked up.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

The cabin crew member on AI 772, that was preparing for take-off to Kolkata with boarding completed, took offence and then the two almost came to blows in full view of passengers. When informed of the situation by other crew on board, the airline immediately grounded both of them and the flight operated with a delay of two hours after calling in another captain and purser. This fight, which now both AI and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) are probing, happened when AI's Airbus A320 was going to operate on the Bengaluru-Kolkata route. \"The pilot got food from home and asked the senior crew member to heat it. Apparently after finishing his meal, the pilot told this crew member to rinse the container. He objected to being asked to do so and there was an altercation but perhaps no fist fight,\" said a senior aviation official probing this case. Confirming the onboard fight, an AI spokesman said, \"Airline chairman Ashwani Lohani has taken a very stern view of this issue. Both the pilot and crew member have been summoned to the Delhi HQ for questioning on Thursday. The two were off-rostered (taken off flying duty) the moment report of this fight came to the management.\" Asked if being asked to clean a tiffin box led to the fight, the AI official said, \"During preliminary questioning, both the flight crew members have said that they were pushed by the other when they were going to the cockpit. Both are accusing the other of pushing them first which led to the fight. This issue is being probed to see exactly what led to the fight.\" The fight led to the flight being delayed by over two hours. AI 772 has a schedule departure time of 11.15 am from Bengaluru and arrives in Kolkata two hours later. On Monday when the fight broke out, the flight left Bengaluru at 1.22pm after AI got a replacement crew as the captain and flight purser had been grounded. Luckily this fight did not erupt mid air and happened when the aircraft was on the ground at the airport. In the past, airlines have witnessed midair fights between crew members too. A senior pilot said, \"Crew members fighting on board aircraft, or during layovers between flights, is simply not acceptable. It does not matter who started the fight , the other person should have acted with restraint, maturity and filed a report with the management for further action,\" said a senior pilot.

But how does one go for a walk in such a situation,\u201d asked KN Balasubramanya Setti, an 80-year-old resident form the locality. In case of emergencies, one cannot get out of the apartment, nor can an ambulance come to help, added Setti.

It has also become popular for is a platform for young talented individuals. Taking a cue from travel and food bloggers, many Make-up Artists (MUAs) have started using Instagram to showcase their work in the last few months. The Personal Touch For 28-year-old Vaishnavi, who is a product designer and manager at healthcare start-up, being an MUA came about by chance. But creating a personalised Insta page for her work as an MUA was a choice Vaishnavi is glad she made. Though there is an option to start a business handle, Vaishnavi chose to post her work as MUA along with her personal posts. \u201cI got more positive responses because of this, because people could see a face and a person behind the work. The personal touch with posts from my everyday life with my work gave it a human touch,\u201d Vaishnavi explains. \u201cPeople will go \u2018oh! I know what this person is like. I can trust her\u2019 because they see me doing things beyond make-up,\u201d she adds. She reduced the number of posts on her business page \u2018Pumpkin Chariot\u2019 after finding greater engagement with her personal profile. Vaishnavi began styling people as a hobby and as a result of increasing demand, also started providing make-up services to strangers who then became her clients. Now, she is taking it a step further by giving services shaped by her personal experiences. \u201cI wanted to instil in my clients a feeling of self-love and confidence which I attained after lots of ups and downs. People say that social media can be depressing. But I am utilising Instagram to bring together my personal experiences and professional expertise to help people,\u201d Vaishnavi says. According to Vaishnavi, Instagram has also given MUAs a lot of respect and they are seen as more than just \u2018Parlour persons\u2019. \u201cNow the whole concept has changed because of big brands and collaborations on Insta. Now we are artists who are also called \u2018influencers.\u2019 It is a big step for this field,\u201d she says. Posting an ambition For 25-year-old Roshni Mubeen, Instagram was much more than just a social media platform to stay in touch with her friends. For the young software engineer, Instagram proved to be the platform to fulfil her dream of becoming a popular MUA. \u201cOn Instagram, it is easier for people to see your work through pictures and videos. It\u2019s also much easier to interact with your audience,\u201d Roshni says. She quit her job last year, after working for nearly four years and started as an MUA on Instagram (with the handle ShineWithShadesByRoshni) from January. \u201cI enrolled for a course to hone my skills. In addition, Instagram has helped me gain a lot of clients. Bridal make-up and modelling shoots are some assignments that come my way,\u201d she says. Roshni has gained 1,500 followers in the past five months on Instagram. She attributes the growth to word of mouth as well as the platform\u2019s algorithms. \u201cInsta highlights people\u2019s interests and shows them what they like,\u201d Roshni explains. The young MUA had to endure a lot of difficulties to get here. Her family was initially sceptical about make-up as a profession and Instagram as a platform, she says. They\u2019ve changed their minds now. \u201cFrom appreciation to a supportive community, I have found it all on Insta. I have even made some really good friends thanks to Instagram,\u201d Roshni says who plans to start her own make-up academy in the future. Connecting with young people Fiza Khan quit her job and took a year\u2019s break before starting her own page as an MUA in October. After choosing a unique name (maquillage_by_fiza, where Maquillage is make-up in French), she began by trying to establish a strong foothold on Instagram and it has paid off in the past few months. \u201cThere are so many talented artists on Instagram who were inspirations to me. There is, of course, Huda Beauty, then Tamanna Roshan, Leena Bhushan and so many more who inspire new MUA like me to explore Instagram and use it to reach a greater number of audiences,\u201d 27-year-old Fiza says. What started as inviting friends to home, doing their make-up and posting pictures on Instagram, has turned into collaborations with models and assignments for bridal and party make-up. Fiza says Instagram provides several opportunities, but one cannot take it for granted. \u201cOn Insta, it is out of sight and out of mind. One must consistently post and engage with your audience to keep the spark alive. If you are doing it all right, nothing like it,\u201d she says. She plans to start a website but will always keep Instagram as the primary source to stay engaged with her clients. It\u2019s you need For Saba Khan, a mother of two, Instagram turned out to be the platform which reignited her passion after almost five years. Saba used to work as an Events Producer for corporates, also doing a six-month stint in Shanghai. But after her marriage in 2013 and motherhood, she went with the flow and kept her career on hold. \u201cBetween all this, I did not forget my passion for make-up. I had always wanted to pursue something in it,\u201d 31-year-old Saba says. She then decided to attend a course in make-up and started her page (Makeup by Saba Khan) on Instagram in September 2018. \u201cIt has been an organic growth on the platform, and I am doing really well with a lot of regular clients. Instagram is the best platform to kick-start your business,\u201d Saba says. Like Vaishnavi, Saba also says that Instagram has helped to get rid of the stigma attached to make-up artists. \u201cThey were not seen as artists earlier. Now, there are no tags and there is an obvious change in the attitude of people,\u201d she says. Saba says her USP is providing realistic make-up to enhance her clients\u2019 beauty. \u201cOften it is people who don\u2019t regularly wear make-up who visit MUAs. I specialise in not going overboard and that\u2019s what people like,\u201d She says, adding that the feedback on Instagram on this has helped her to make it her trademark. \u201cOne won\u2019t get a chance to interact with their clients like that on a website. I don\u2019t think one needs a website if you have a page on Insta. A good promotion and social media marketing are the only things required in this age,\u201d Saba adds.

Punati Sridhar, principal chief conservator of forests, told TOI he has communicated the same to luxury watchmaker Rolex though its Twitter handle and is awaiting its response. \u201cEven to facilitate payment in a single case, one has to interact with forest department officers. No such interactions happened with Wild Seve. Moreover, the department pays ex gratia and not compensation. So the claim of \u2018compensation\u2019 itself is flawed,\u201d stated Sridhar, who reiterated the same in his Facebook post on Tuesday. The department said the director of Bandipur Tiger Reserve, where Wild Seve claims to have worked, had issued a press note on May 17 stating its claims were false. The note had said that no organisation, individual and NGO was involved in facilitating the process of payment of compensation for crop damage or death of livestock due to attacks by wild animals and hence, any such claims are baseless and far from the truth. On the allegations made by the forest department, the Centre for Wildlife Studies \u2014 Krithi is its executive director \u2014 said the press statement (by forest department) and social media posts are factually incorrect and may mislead the potential rural beneficiaries of Wild Seve. \u201cThe programme is being implemented on private land or public access areas outside notified forest areas directly administered by the forest department. It is implemented by us directly in collaboration with individuals who are victims of wildlife conflict incidents. We intervene and assist them only after they voluntarily seek our help. It is perfectly legal. We have, so far, operated the Wild Seve programme around Bandipur and Nagarahole national parks with over 13,702 claims filed on behalf of 6,505 individual beneficiaries. The programme doesn\u2019t claim that it has provided direct compensation as is alleged in some recent media posts,\u201d a CWS statement said. The statement further said any unbiased observer can examine Wild Seve\u2019s record on the ground and they will be happy to share details with those interested.

Channabasappa, 30, a resident of Devanahalli and from Gadag district, told the court that he is a government employee and was driving the ambulance in a careful manner and was on the way to attend an emergency case when the accident occurred on the night of May 27. A vehicle ahead of him had suddenly applied brakes and to avoid hitting it, he swerved to the right, resulting in the accident, he added. Channabasappa also contended that Yelahanka traffic police had booked him under the various charges, including culpable homicide under IPC section 304, though there was no sufficient ingredient in the incident. The public prosecutor argued that the driver had knowledge that his negligent act would have caused the death of some innocent persons. Though the accused may not have had intention to kill anybody, his act of negligence coupled with the knowledge that his act would cause death was a crucial aspect that the court had to consider. He pointed out that the investigation report disclosed that the accused was on official duty, but was proceeding towards his residence in Devanahalli. Considering all these, the judge opined that the negligent act of the accused resulted in the death of five persons and it was not a fit case to grant bail at this stage, as the investigation is still under way.

Here is a case where the accused, being a responsible government servant and having knowledge of the consequences of his act of driving, drove his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner, crossed the divider and hit the oncoming vehicle, which resulted in death of five innocent lives... Hence the act of the investigating officer in pressing section IPC 304 at this stage is valid,\u201d said K Narayana Prasad, 55th additional city civil & session judge, in his order on Saturday. Alister Anthony Pareira, who was from a family of real estate developers, driving a Toyota Corolla, had mowed down seven people on Carter Road, Mumbai in 2006.

The health department has empowered deputy commissioners to constitute Arogya Raksha Samithis involving physicians, surgeons, paediatricians, gynaecologists and other specialists, who will visit taluk and district hospitals and public health centres on call to treat patients and pay them the same amount they get in private hospitals. The scheme, conceptualised last year, kicked in January this year. Due to the Lok Sabha polls, the implementation had been delayed. \u201cThe committee will frequently meet and analyse shortage of specialties in public health institutions and fix on-call rates for different types of cases, taking into consideration fees charged by specialists in private hospitals,\u2019\u2019 said Pankaj Kumar Pandey, commissioner, state health department. The rates will be fixed based on taluks and regions. \u201cLocal problems, availability of specialists in private sector, convenience of transport and distance to nearest specialty hospital will be taken into consideration. The committee will have the liberty to fix high rates after giving valid reasons,\u201d Pandey said. Once rates are fixed, the district health officer will advertise in local newspapers for on-call specialists. Depending on the response, he\u2019ll constitute panels involving 4-8 specialists in each field. In 2017-18, the Karnataka government had rolled out the \u2018specialists on call\u2019 scheme to create a pool of specialists in every district of the state to overcome shortage of doctors and avoid wastage of resources in staterun hospitals under the National Health Mission. Quality healthcare for all \u2018Revised on-call fees will push doctors to go to govt hospitals\u2019However, there was poor response from private doctors because the government had standardised the oncall fees in all districts. \u201cIt failed as the on-call fee for a doctor in a private hospital in Bengaluru was the same as that for a doctor in a private hospital in Yadgir (a backward district),\u201d said a senior health officer. \u201cWith the fees hiked, the government will pay the deficit,\u2019\u2019 Pandey said. As per health department estimates, about 3,000 posts of doctors, including 1,400 specialists, are vacant statewide. Many specialists appointed since 2015 haven\u2019t reported for duty. Health activist Somashekar Bhandari said: \u201cThis scheme may encourage doctors in the private sector. However, why would a doctor travel long distances to treat a patient when she can earn the same money by consulting at 3-4 private hospitals within a 5km range?,\u2019\u2019 he asked. \u201cThe revised rates on par with other private hospitals will encourage doctors to go to government hospitals,\u201d said Bengaluru-based gynaecologist Dr K Kishore. DNB doctors in Karnataka To deal with shortage of specialists, the Union health & family welfare ministry allotted 80 specialists seats to Karnataka under DNB (Diplomate in National Board) courses. Last year, the parliamentary standing committee on health recommended that the DNB awarded by the National Board of Examination is equivalent to Doctor of Medicine (MD), except in teaching. Health commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey said these doctors have to do three years on-the-job training and then sign a bond of 5 years with the government.

They said the impact of the swindle by Ambidant Marketing Pvt Ltd, whose business model was similar to IMA\u2019s, would pale in comparison to the negative fallout from the IMA rip-off.  IMA office in Shivajinagar \u201cPoliticians were spotted with Mansoor at public functions he hosted such as mushairas (poetic symposiums),\u201d a source said. \u201cBut Mansoor actually got ulemas to endorse his audit books. Two years ago he brought out a booklet based on these endorsements, stating that all investments in his firm were halal (permissible).\u201d A senior Muslim Congress leader said there is a crisis of confidence among the community towards politicians and ulemas. \u201cCertain ulemas, instead of speaking on the Quran\u2019s teachings in their Friday sermons, asked their congregations to pray for the welfare of Mansoor and his companies,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them even issued fatwas endorsing his business, when most of them were unaware of how financial institutions should operate.\u201d Hundreds of investors have filed a police complaint at the convention centerSources said a majority of Muslim politicians were beneficiaries of Mansoor\u2019s largesse either through election funding or projects like renovation of government schools. \u201cThe fact that they were seen with Mansoor gave confidence to people who had some savings,\u201d one source said.

That the Congress gave just one ticket to the community in the recent Lok Sabha polls, when the norm in the past was two to three, has demotivated Muslim leaders. \u201cThe party leadership has taken the community for granted.

This is not a condolence meeting, this is celebrating Girish,\u201d said Arundhati Nag, addressing a packed audience at Ranga Shankara\u2019s foyer. Following her brief address, the event that lasted for a little over two hours saw Bengaluru\u2019s diverse theatre talent, including B Jayashree, Arjun Sajnani and TS Nagabharana, read from the 14 plays that Karnad wrote in his lifetime \u2014 Yayati, Tughlaq, Hayavadana, Nagamandala, Taledanda, Agni Mattu Male and Rakshasa Tangadi, among others. I was always in awe of him: B JayashreeOne of Kannada theatre\u2019s most respected actors, B Jayashree knew Karnad in both personal and professional capacities. \u201cWhile he never directed me in his plays, I got to see that aspect of his when he cast me in Cheluvi, where I played the protagonist\u2019s mother. He was a calm, thoughtful director. And because he knew my work he never interfered. He let me act in my own style,\u201d said Jayashree. Having had the unique fortune of being directed by Shankar Nag for Karnad\u2019s Nagamandala, Jayashree eventually directed the same play. \u201cThere were people who weren\u2019t OK with my version of Nagamandala. They asked him how he could be OK with the changes I had made. He silenced them saying he had great faith in my abilities and that he was fine with the changes I had made to the play. He was a great man who was straight-forward and down to earth. I was always in awe of him,\u201d she said.I hope we don\u2019t freeze, but reinterpret his plays: NagMahalakshmi.P@timesgroup.comAs someone who knew Karnad for decades, Arundhati Nag finds it implausible to capture him in one word. Ask her what is that one word or quality she associates with Karnad and she says: \u201cThere are so many qualities, I can\u2019t just pick one.\u201d But she has a lot to say when it is about discussing Karnad\u2019s work. On being directed by KarnadOdakalu Bimba was the only play he directed himself, and that too because he was worried about how someone else would interpret this image and persona issue (the theme of play). He seemed to have it in his mind, but then he didn\u2019t know how to crack it, which is why he took KM Chaitanya as his co-director. Chaitanya helped him crack the technicalities of how to shoot it. As for me, it was about flowing with the tide and providing him with what he wanted. It wasn\u2019t difficult to work with him because Girish had a great amount of respect for the work that I had done. He understood my range and he played within that range. He also allowed me a lot of freedom. Karnad\u2019s heroinesHis women (characters) are the ones who have the questions, who are going through the tumultuous journeys. For me, doing Odakalu Bimba was also about playing one of his most complicated contemporary women.On keeping Karnad\u2019s legacy alive For Girish, it was about shaking the middle-class with his plays. He did it through mythology, and then with Anjumallige (which dealt with incest), he took off on today\u2019s contemporary subjects. In Odakalu Bimba, he asked more serious questions of how we are living in this world of electronic images. My hope is that we don\u2019t end up keeping him frozen in his works such that when you visit Karnataka after 50 years, we are still doing Hayavadana in the same way it was first written. I hope that while we continue to do his plays in the old mould, we also reinterpret them as his themes are so universal, the questions are so universal.

Cops from Bhowanipore arrived around 10-15 minutes later.

They called cops, who came and asked her to file an FIR at the Charu Market police station. It was 1.30 a.m. when she reached there but, instead of taking down her complaint, the cops there directed her to Bhowanipore police station where the first assault had occured. \u201cI just gave up and started shouting at this point. There was no female police officer. The officer there finally took down my complaint after asking a lot of questions but refused to take the cabby\u2019s complaint, stating that two FIR could not be taken for the same incident,\u201d she said.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option. We need to see how this will pan out.\" In Video:Bill seeking to lift green card cap amended to protect US workersDownload The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."}, "Bollywood actors who would be great teachers": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/bollywood-actors-who-would-be-great-teachers/photostory/65684334.cms", "description": ""}, "Samsung": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/heres-how-samsung-got-mocked-for-its-social-media-post/articleshow/69835890.cms", "description": ""}, "Dangerous OFC": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/dangerousofc/articleshow/69834364.cms", "description": ""}, "Suicide is no solution to debt, says HDK": {"datetime": "", "time": "2019-06-19 10:33:00", "description": "MANDYA: Chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Tuesday met family members of Suresh, the debt-ridden farmer who took his life after leaving behind a video clip where he claimed the burden of loans from private moneylenders had driven him to take the extreme step.

The Congress high command is likely to seek the resignation of all its ministers and inject fresh faces in the cabinet, a decision which will mean some ministerial aspirants who are openly voicing dissent would get a berth. The idea was mooted by Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah when the two independents were inducted into the cabinet, but a decision was put on hold. Sugar minister RB Thimmapur, in Belagavi on Tuesday, virtually confirmed the move, saying: \u201cWe are ready to resign in December if the high command asks us to do so.\u201d Thimmapur suggested the two independents \u2014 H Nagesh and R Shankar \u2014 were inducted into the cabinet to save the government from falling. Vishwanath to continue?Meanwhile, AH Vishwanath is likely to withdraw his resignation from the post of JD(S) state president, following a request from party surpemo HD Deve Gowda. During a luncheon meeting at the former Prime Minister\u2019s residence on Tuesday, Gowda reportedly prevailed on Vishwanath to continue as president, while categorically turning down his request to be relieved of the responsibility. Vishwanath had tendered his resignation two weeks ago, citing ill-health, while also owning responsibility for the party\u2019s poor show in the recent Lok Sabha elections. Gowda is believed to have requested Vishwanath to continue as president for some more time, saying the party is in a \"poor state\" and he needed a leader of Vishwanath\u2019s calibre and commitment to rebuild it. Vishwanath reportedly remained non-committal to Gowda's request and has asked for a few days' time to make a decision. It is learnt Vishwanath is also in a dilemma, but is likely to heed Gowda's request as he is indebted to the former Prime Minister for giving him political rebirth after he was sidelined in the Congress. When contacted, Vishwanath said his poor health does not permit him to do justice to the post. \"I will take a decision soon,\" Vishwanath said. Tourism minister SR Mahesh, with whom Vishwanath is peeved for refusing to extend tickets to his supporters in the KR Nagar local body election, was also present at the meeting.

Well, you take your own vehicles, mostly two-wheelers, and head out. But then comes the next hurdle. Where do you park? With no space earmarked for students to park their vehicles inside campus, most are compelled to hunt for spots in the neighbourhood, which in turn inconveniences residents of the area. With traffic cops cracking the whip on students parking near college, many end up missing class in their search for an appropriate spot, or pay hefty fines for violating rules. Educational institutions like Mount Carmel College, Jyothi Nivas College and Sri Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain College are a few city colleges that offer no parking solutions for students using their own means of transport. Safety of vehicles an issue\u201cOne day, I had parked my scooter close to the boundary wall of a house near my college. On my return, I saw that they had scribbled \u2018Do Not Park Here\u2019 on the seat. Thankfully, it was with chalk, though,\u201d says Bindu Menon*, a student of Mount Carmel College. The lack of parking area means that students leave their two-wheelers and four-wheelers by the roadside close to college. For students who live far, this translates into leaving early from home to get a parking spot near college. And their woes don\u2019t end here. Roadside parking often leads to quarrels with residents of the area, as well as fines paid to traffic cops. Radhika Suman* from Jyoti Nivas College rues, \u201cOur college has limited parking space. By the time we reach in the morning, the nearby lanes are almost full, considering that there are a lot of offices and eateries in the vicinity. Even if we do manage to find parking space, there is no guarantee on the safety of our vehicles and we often come back to see punctured tyres, scratches and dents. Sometimes, our vehicles are towed away by traffic cops, which are released only after we cough up the fine.\u201d Colleges claim they are helping studentsCollege authorities, meanwhile, say they are doing their best to help students with parking space. \u201cThis year, senior students will be allowed to park their vehicles in the ground near college, that is otherwise used for all sports activities. Freshers are encouraged to use public transport or carpool,\u201d says Jency Jose, student welfare officer at Mount Carmel College. Jency adds that even though the administration regularly informs students not to bring their own vehicles, they continue to do so. \u201cWe have also told students not to park their vehicles in the lanes nearby, as it inconveniences residents,\u201d she adds. Anila Thomas, lecturer at Jyoti Nivas College , says that though there is enough space for students to park, sometimes due to construction work, there are difficulties. \u201cThere is enough space for students, but because there is construction work going on, we sometimes have a problem. The students too are adjusting with the parking space that is available to them now. But this is just temporary, if students have an issue they can always approach us,\u201d says Anila.

Iffco-Tokio General Insurance Company has been directed to settle the compensation to Jabir Singh and Krishna Kumar alias Krishan Kumar from west Bengaluru. On April 13, 2017, a Bengaluru court had awarded Rs 9.91 lakh with 9% interest as compensation. Justice HT Narendra Prasad said the company is at liberty to recover the amount from BR Pradeep, owner of the private bus, as per the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the Rani vs National Insurance Company case in 2018. At 9.15pm on June 14, 2015, Jabir and Krishna Kumar were going to Makali on Tumakuru-Bengaluru NH-4 on their motorcycle. When they reached KBD factory near Nelamangala, the speeding bus dashed against their bike. They sustained grievous injuries and were admitted to hospital. After recovery, they moved the Bengaluru court by filing claim petitions. On April 13, 2017, the court granted Rs 7.76 lakh with 9% interest to Jagir and Rs 1.5 lakh with 9% to Krishna Kumar. But the court fixed the liability on the owner of the offending vehicle, claiming it had violated the route permit. Both the claimants challenged this verdict.

Chintan Ramesh Magadum had alighted from the bus and was crossing the road to reach his daycare centre when the accident occurred. Raising an alarm over the incident, Ramya S, a parent said: \"My seven-year-old daughter is in class 2 and this incident has caused a lot of distress. Since our apartment is located close to a bend, it\u2019s nearly impossible to spot speeding vehicles coming towards you. This is why the driver always parks close to the apartment gate. As school buses and private vans aren\u2019t allowed inside our apartment complex, they ensure children enter the complex, accompanied by an adult guardian or an older family member. Such measures must be taken by all schools and attendants, while bus drivers must be extra careful while ferrying toddlers.\" TimesViewThe death of a child in a freak accident has rattled parents and teachers alike. It was highly irresponsible of both the bus driver and the attendant to let go of the boy without ensuring he safely crossed the road, and they should be brought to book. Parents hand over their children to schools with an unwavering faith that the little ones would be well taken care of. Monday\u2019s tragic incident should serve as a constant reminder for all stakeholders that they can\u2019t be lax with safety, as a split second of oversight could turn fatal.\"Safety of children is the responsibility of all stakeholders, including parents, guardians, bus drivers and attendants. We do insist that a parent or guardian (with parents\u2019 permission) picks a child up from where we drop him/her, in whose absence, the child is either escorted to his home by the attendant or brought back to the school where he/she can stay safe until parents arrive. Each of the 100 buses in our fleet comes with a woman attendant. We regularly conduct sessions for them and the drivers to hone their driving and other skills; we also get their eyes tested. This must happen across all schools in the state,\" said Manju Balasubramaniam, principal, Delhi Public School, Bangalore North. Immaculate Christopher, principal of Sophia Nursery Primary School on Old Airport Road, said extra attention must be paid to children from nursery and primary sections since they may not know how to navigate through traffic. \"We always ensure that a child is escorted by an attendant on his/her way back home from school. We suggest parents of children from one apartment complex could take turns to escort a group of children, if possible,\" she added. Other little victimsMonday\u2019s incident was only the latest in a long list of road mishaps involving toddlers, show data available with city traffic police. While over eight children (below the age of 7) were victims of fatal road accidents recorded within city limits till May this year, 11 children were killed in 2018. Records also show how over 87 children were injured in road accidents recorded within city limits in 2018. In February, two school children were injured after a school bus collided head-on with a college bus in a north Bengaluru locality.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

Monsoon hit the coast on June 13, delayed by five days for the first time in recent years. It has become persistently weak since then with only districts like Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Uttara Kannada and Kodagu receiving rain, according to Srinivas Reddy, director, Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC). Usually, monsoon enters the coast between June 7 and 9 and spreads across the state by June 19. But that hasn\u2019t been the case this year. \u201cTill now, monsoon has covered just 20 per cent of Karnataka. Moreover, no cloud formation and pressure are being seen anywhere in the state, which is really a worrying factor,\u201d Reddy said hinting at a continued dry spell in the coming days. The rainfall data of KSNDMC shows none of the 30 districts received normal rainfall between June 11 and 17. The average rainfall deficit touched 80 per cent in most districts of south interior and north interior Karnataka during the period. For example, the cumulative rainfall in south interior Karnataka between June 1 and 17 is 19 per cent more than normal while it has received 79.7 per cent less rainfall between June 11 and 17, indicating a sharp decrease. Even in coastal districts, which have been witnessing showers for the few days, the figures are below normal. Sowing takes a beatingElusive showers have also impacted sowing activities across the state, mainly in rain-fed North Karnataka. As per data provided by the office of the agriculture director, of the 76.7 lakh hectares of targeted area under kharif crops, sowing has taken place only in 6.9 lakh hectares, including 3.3 lakh hectares of irrigated land. In 10 districts of North Karnataka, including Bidar, Vijayapura, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Gadag and Haveri, no sowing has been done. \u201cThis is almost 10 percentage points less than the area usually covered by the second week of June.

The move comes against the backdrop of the IMA Group cheating thousands of investors of crores of rupees. Revenue minister RV Deshpande told TOI that the government is contemplating new legislation for Ponzi schemes that will involve fast-track courts to ensure speedy trials. \u201cWe have realised that there are certain loopholes in the system that have to be plugged,\u201d Deshpande said. \u201cFast-track courts for Ponzi cases are among various reforms we are considering.\u201d The IMA Group scam surfaced last week after an audio clip surfaced of its founder-owner, Mohammed Mansoor Khan, threatening to commit suicide. That led to thousands of depositors lodging police complaints against the firm. The case has posed new challenges to investigators. Among them, the firm claimed to be a limited liability partnership in which profits are subject to market risks, precluding police from taking action against it under the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments (KPID) Act, 2004. Officials contemplating the new legislation said the department of parliamentary affairs is studying the issue and a bill for the new law is likely to be introduced during the monsoon session of the assembly. Home minister MB Patil said the government wanted to give investigating agencies more teeth. \u201cPolice currently cannot confiscate the assets of a Ponzi company even if there is a case,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a procedure to be followed through the revenue department. In the new system, police will have the power to seize properties.\u201d He said the government will create a common platform comprising representatives of the police, revenue, income tax and commercial tax departments to deal with cases related to Ponzi schemes. In the absence of such an arrangement, cases have not progressed and depositors have been left without restitution years after cases were filed. For instance, in the ViniVinc case, an early Ponzi company that unravelled in 2005, only a handful of depositors retrieved their money. In the Ambidant case of last year, 1,700 complainants with claims totalling Rs 600 crore are yet to get back their money as the matter is entangled in legal and procedural quagmires. Government sources said around 17 Ponzi companies are currently facing trial. The government recently took back the power to seize assets that it had handed to the competent authority \u2014 the assistant commissioner of revenue. Principal secretary, revenue, Rajkumar Khatri said steps are being taken to restore the power of the assistant commissioner to confiscate assets. LC Nagaraj, assistant commissioner, revenue, Bangalore north subdivision, said the special investigation team (SIT) has identified movable assets including gold jewellery in in the IMA case and on Monday started the process to seize them. \u201cIt takes time to initiate the process to seize immovable properties of the IMA Group as the government is yet to restore our power to do so,\u201d Nagaraj said. While police earlier said it could not invoke the KPID Act against IMA, Nagaraj said they now could as the department had received complaints from people claiming that they had deposited money with the firm and Mansoor Khan is now on the run.

While parking has been banned on MG Road, there\u2019s already a restriction on Church Street. With no designated parking space available nearby, visitors and shop keepers are facing inconvenience.

Many visitors said they had to do multiple rounds in the central business district (CBD) to park their vehicles and come to MG Road. There are over 200 commercial establishments and office spaces on the stretch between Brigade Junction and Anil Kumble Circle itself. The authorities should have made some alternative arrangements, either by temporarily acquiring properties adjacent to Kamaraj Road and allowing vehicles along a portion of the stretch itself,\u201d he added. Deepak Batavia, president, Church Street Occupants\u2019 Association, said they are yet to recover from the losses they have incurred during the redevelopment of Church Street. \u201cUnlike Commercial Street or other hubs, there are a lot of eateries on Church Street. People prefer to drive in with families and friends to eat and drink. Despite having slots, parking has been prohibited here since more than a year,\u201d he added. He said a memorandum will be submitted to the government requesting not to ban vehicles on the street.

So it stands to reason that inventors \u2014 who are wont to take inspiration from nature \u2014 would by now have had a brainwave or two about the potential for innovation from this incredible organ. And scientists have, over the past decade or so, modelled automated arms after the elephant trunk, including for operations in industrial settings, in agriculture and even as an aid for people with disabilities. But perhaps for the first time ever, a team of researchers from International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIIT-B) and National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Nimhans) is awaiting a patent for a robot prototype \u2014 a hyperflexible bionic probe \u2014 inspired by an elephant\u2019s trunk and developed for brain surgery. The new device will allow surgeons to perform brain surgeries via a single port \u2014 an incision to insert equipment \u2014 and with just one probe. \u201cThis will change things completely. Surgeons now require multiple ports and numerous probes to do the same job,\u201d said Prof Madhav Rao of IIIT-B. While the robot is still a long way away from being deployed in operation theatres, its inventors say it could be the first of a series of products that revolutionise surgeries. Among other things, the robot, christened \u2018Mythri\u2019, can be manoeuvred within the body to ferret out cysts or tumours. Dr Vikas Vazhiyal of Nimhans recalled that he approached Rao and his team in 2016 with an idea for the product. \u201cRobotics had been around for a while in medicine, but not really in neuroscience,\u201d Vazhiyal said. \u201cI felt there was an opportunity and we began work on the idea.\u201d \u201cWe needed a flexible and light tool, and the first thing that came to mind was an elephant\u2019s trunk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe elephant\u2019s trunk is extremely tactile. It uses it to sense things, bathe, drink water and lift heavy objects. We wanted our tool to be just as versatile, something that could sneak into deep into the brain and do the work needed.\u201d Unlike the abdomen for instance, space is at a premium in the brain because so many vital parts are packed into a small place. \u201cThe elephant trunk was perfect in this respect,\u201d Vazhiyal said. \u201cFlexible robots of today are completely solid. We needed a hollow device with the equipment needed packed within.\u201d Rao said the tool uses a pulley system based on a micromotor. \u201cIt will be the first laparoscope with the ability to make three-dimensional movements,\u201d he said. Surgeons currently have to make at least two incisions for laparoscopic surgeries: One incision to insert the laparoscope, the other to manoeuvre it. Since Mythri can make 3D movements with more than 5\u00b0 of freedom, a second incision will not be required, Rao said. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed Mythri for neurosurgeries, but I\u2019m confident that it could be used in other parts of the body such as the abdomen,\u201d Vazhiyal said.

These employees submitted their complaint to the DCP (East) in private as they feared they would be attacked by the other investors many of whom they encouraged to join the scheme. DCP (east) Rahul Kumar Shahapurwad said the employees had submitted their original documents while joining the IMA Group and sought them back so that they could apply for other jobs. Police sources said the employees admitted to pushing people to invest in the firm in return for incentives. They also took responsibility for the funds on behalf of their employer and assured huge returns. A preliminary probe puts the employees\u2019 own investments at Rs 2 crore. They were afraid of coming in the open as they feared they may be attacked. On condition of anonymity, one employee said the staffers knew the company wasn\u2019t doing well but Khan and other directors assured them they would bounce back. Several attempts were also made to bring the company out of the red. \u201cWe had no option but to trust Mansoor as we had also invested money,\u201d the employee said.

FUO is a condition where a person\u2019s down with fever (101\u00b0 F) for over 2-3 weeks and investigations fail to determine its cause. While there were 1,57,881 FUO cases in 2017, the number stood at 1,42,890 in 2018 and 50,062 till May 2019. According to the ongoing study conducted by the the BBMP\u2019s Public Health Information and Epidemiological Cell (PHIEC), FUO has emerged as the most common reason for hospital visits by Bengalureans under the \u2018communicable diseases\u2019 category. The data was collated from 450 private and government hospitals in the city, including independent labs and diagnostic centres, BBMP\u2019s 85 primary health centres and 30 maternity hospitals. The exercise was taken up under the National Urban Health Mission to enable policymakers to design preventive strategies. However, hardly any efforts are being made to analyse FUO. Senior doctors working with PHIEC admitted the team hasn\u2019t done much to decipher the FUO data. \u201cWe are focusing more on preventing common communicable diseases like typhoid, cholera, dengue and gastroenteritis. If tests for typhoid, dengue, malaria and Hepatitis are negative, hospitals report them as FUO cases,\u201d said BBMP officials. The data has come as a shocker for the medical community. Those with self-limiting fever hardly come back for follow-up visits and can\u2019t be categorised as FUO patients, said Dr Ambanna Gowda, consultant, internal medicine specialist, Fortis Hospitals. \u201cOn the first day of fever, we don\u2019t advise a battery of tests. If the patient doesn\u2019t return, it can\u2019t be called FUO. If the same person visits another hospital, we wouldn\u2019t know. The data may not be completely accurate,\u201d said Dr Gowda. He recalled the case of 10-year-old boy from Odisha who\u2019s being treated for FUO. Formation of lymph nodes in the chest has now emerged as the cause. FUO is usually a symptom of tuberculosis, malignancy or abscess (puss formation in body tissue), which are diagnosed only after several tests, he pointed out. However, the BBMP ruled out duplication in data furnished by city hospitals. \u201cA patient\u2019s name and address can\u2019t appear more than once in BBMP\u2019s PHIEC data pool if he or she goes to another hospital with the same complaint. The address is captured using GIS-based reporting and hence, there\u2019s no room for repeat entries,\u201d civic officials explained. Loopholes in data reporting?According to Dr SM Prasad, vice president, Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Bengaluru chapter, to consider a case as that of FUO, a patient\u2019s fever must be watched and documented for at least seven days. \u201cIf it persists for the duration and tests don\u2019t reveal any cause, only then can it be called FUO. There could be loopholes in reporting of data. FUO could be an uncommon manifestation of a common illness, like fever seen in a child with skin allergy or puss formation. It could also be a common manifestation of an uncommon illness like meningitis (inflammation of brain, spinal cord),\u201d he opined. The expert ruled out the possibility of lakhs of such cases being seen regularly in OPDs. Doctors also said since the BBMP data doesn\u2019t reflect the duration of FUO, it\u2019s not sufficient to draw any conclusions. \u201cUsually in fever cases that are self-limiting viral infections, we don\u2019t look for the cause. If a child has fever but is stable, no investigation is done if it subsides. There\u2019s a possibility of such cases being reported as those of FUO. The data doesn\u2019t make much sense,\u201d said Dr SG Kasi, a paediatrician.

Dikshit is not that important leader.\u201d Kejriwal has been urging the Congress to stitch an alliance in Delhi for the Lok Sabha polls to keep the BJP away from power. Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

The incident, which occurred in Rajarajeshwarinagar, has sent shockwaves across the locality. \"Had the driver or the van\u2019s attendant been more cautious, the boy would have lived. Sheer negligence on their part resulted in his death,\" said police. The victim, Chintan Ramesh Magadum, was a class 1 student of Swarangini School and PU College in BEML Layout. Chintan\u2019s father Ramesh Magadum works in a private company, while his mother Madhuri is a teacher. Ramesh and Madhuri had ensured that Chintan is dropped at the daycare centre in the school bus after classes. In fact, the attendant would escort Chintan to the centre on the other side of the road. Later, the couple would pick him up from the centre. The same routine unfolded on Monday, when the school van driven by Suresh stopped near the daycare centre at 3pm. However, the woman attendant reportedly did not pay attention to Chintan. She allegedly allowed the boy to cross the road on his own and returned to the bus. The driver, on seeing the attendant get into the vehicle, assumed Chintan had entered the daycare centre and pressed the accelerator. \"We have seized the bus and arrested the driver. He said he hadn\u2019t seen Chintan in front of the vehicle and this led to the accident,\" a police officer said.
