The woman, a resident of Laharpur Balia village under Bhamora police station jurisdiction, had delivered a stillborn baby on June 9. Family of the deceased woman said that she was suffering from severe depression after learning about her stillborn baby. However, doctors are not ready to accept this theory and the matter has been referred to police for a probe. The incident took place at around 4:30 am. Dr Alka Sharma, chief medical superintendent (CMS) of government women\u2019s hospital, said that it was a caesarean delivery and she was shocked to know how she could climb up to the third floor. \u201cThe woman was admitted to a maternity ward on the first floor which is completely covered from all sides. A woman who has undergone caesarean delivery cannot walk even for 10 steps without help from others, within a week of the surgery. It is indeed a matter of investigation now. The body has been handed over to the police for post-mortem examination,\u201d the CMS said. The CMS also said that the hospital staff informed her about the incident at 4:51 am. Doctors said that since the woman was very upset after the delivery, they had allowed her husband and mother in-law to stay with her as attendants. While station house officer of Kotvali, Pankaj Tyagi, said that they would examine the CCTV footage to ascertain who was with the woman when she climbed the third floor. Notably, the woman was married only a year ago. Her mother in-law said, \u201cMy daughter in-law was suffering from severe depression after giving birth to a stillborn. She used to start crying after seeing other women with newborn babies in the maternity ward.

It also hopes that once owners learn about their usefulness, they will not abandon their cattle, which left unattended become a menace for all. It is proposed to manufacture beauty products like organic gau-ubtan (face pack), bio pesticides, organic fertilizers, agarbatti (incense sticks), soap and cow dung cakes from cow urine and dung. . These products will be marketed under the name, \u2018Gau-Shakti\u2019, said government officials. The idea is to ensure that people identify the economic value of bovines even if they are not giving milk or ploughing the fields, they added. \u201cKeeping a cow even if it is not giving milk is useful as the dung of a single animal in a year can produce bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides for 30 acres of agricultural land,\u201d said chief development officer Mahendra Singh Tanwar. Making an announcement to the effect, Amrit Tripathi, DM of Shahjahanpur, distributed gau-shakti kits to 313 couples who tied the knot at a mass wedding ceremony on Sunday. \u201cThese products are expected to see a proper launch within a month and may hit online stores soon. The revenue generated from these products will be used for running effectively cattle shelters here,\u201d he added.. In order to implement the idea, district administration took the support of Sanjay Upadhyaya, a chemical engineer who has devoted his life for conservation of stray cattle. After conducting experiments with cow dung and urine, he has developed new products which can be used in day-to-day life like tooth powder, tooth paste and bio-fertilizers. Giving details about the project, Tripathi told TOI, \u201cWe are trying to come up with a brand of products made from cow dung and cow urine. These products will be known as Gau-Shakti. The products made from cow dung and urine already have has good demand in the market and it will help us to generate revenue, which can be used for running cow shelters. Also, several people will get employment if these projects prove to be a success.\u201d CDO Tanwar said, \u201cDuring the Vedic era, the cow was considered sacred and every produce of a cow was utilized. Very few people know that keeping a cow means \u2018zero budgeting agriculture\u2019 as fertilizers and organic pesticides can be prepared from the cow dung and its urine. If people become aware about such products derived from cow dung and urine, then they may stop abandoning their cattle.\u201d Download The Times of India News App for Latest City ."}, "Yuvraj Singh-Hazel Keech's love story": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/yuvraj-singh-hazel-keechs-love-story/hazel/photostory/65659438.cms", "description": ""}, "Rajasthan Royals 2019": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rajasthan-royals-team-2019-players-list-rr-team-2019/articleshow/67151472.cms", "description": ""}, "Green Card": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-that-seeks-to-lift-green-card-cap-amended-to-protect-us-workers/articleshow/69849120.cms", "description": "NEW DELHI: In an attempt to strike a balance between those standing in queue for decades for employment-based green cards (owing to the per country caps) and the need to protect American workers, a bill - 'The Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act (S.386)', has been recently amended by Republican Senator Mike Lee. The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option. We need to see how this will pan out.\" In Video:Bill seeking to lift green card cap amended to protect US workersDownload The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."}, "Hema Malini": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/hindi/hema-malini-takes-oath-as-mp-concludes-it-with-radhe-radhe/videoshow/69846569.cms", "description": ""}, "Bollywood actors who would be great teachers": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/bollywood-actors-who-would-be-great-teachers/photostory/65684334.cms", "description": ""}, "Delhi Capitals team": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/delhi-capitals-team-2019-players-list-delhi-team-2019/articleshow/67149933.cms", "description": ""}, "Rare red-headed vulture spotted in Dudhwa": {"datetime": "", "time": "2019-06-19 04:34:00", "description": "BAREILLY: The summer bird census at Dudhwa has revealed the presence of several rare birds in the reserve.

The corporators, who have been agitating for long, alleged that the FIRs were being lodged under fake cases and that they were not being heard even as they have been agitating for a fortnight. Following allegations of misconduct in official chores, Bareilly municipal commissioner Samuel Paul N had earlier lodged an FIR against a BJP corporator Vinod Saini. Fellow corporators since then have been staging protests on Nagar Nigam premises against the senior official. On Saturday, the agitators had burned effigy of municipal commissioner and had submitted a fresh memorandum at mayor\u2019s office threatening to intensify the stir. BJP corporator Vinod Saini said, \u201cIt has been over two weeks that we are agitating against the fake allegations of corruption imposed on me by Bareilly municipal commissioner Samuel Paul N. The official has accused me of misconduct in BMC\u2019s portable shop project and the move is simply to defame me. I and fellow BMC corporators had strongly condemned his action of FIR against me and had demanded the official to tender public apology and take back the fake case. However, the official is adamant and has again lodged a fresh FIR against 28 of us on June 15 under section 144 of CrPC.\u201d Saini added, \u201cI have been serving my duty in Bareilly Nagar Nigam for several years and never came across any such thing.

Since I was being stopped from not entering my office and performing my duties, I had to lodge a fresh FIR against the agitators. However, the corporators repeatedly violated the law and intensified the stir.\u201d On the \u201ccollective\u201d resignation, Paul N said, \u201cNow, they have tendered a collective resignation and the same is invalid as firstly, a corporator must give an individual resignation and cannot offer collective resignation, and secondly, the resignation must be addressed to the mayor. However, the councellors, who claim to have \u2018resigned\u2019, did not address it to Mayor Umesh Gautam, and thus, it is again invalid.\u201d \u201cThe corporators are well aware that unless they address their resignation to mayor who is authorized, it is considered as invalid,\u201d the municipal commissioner said, adding, \u201cThe move is clearly an eyewash.\u201d Paul further said, \u201cThe councellors had made these agitations a new norm in BMC and as this was affecting my work I took legal action and after a while, managed to enter my office on Monday with the help of police force.\u201d Though BJP corporators maintained that they had officially submitted their collective resignation to mayor and that he will be forwarding it to the state government, Bareilly mayor Umesh Gautam has refused to accept any resignation from the corporators so far.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\".

Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

The cases are on the rise, they added. According to data available with the health department, 2,418 cases of plasmodium vivax (PV) malaria and 244 cases of \u201cdeadly\u201d plasmodium falciparum (PF) malaria were detected from January to May in Bareilly district. Of these, 1,972 cases of PV and 130 cases of PF were reported only in May. Similarly, 941 cases of PV and 17 of PF occurred from January to May in Badaun. Out of total cases, 649 cases of PV and two cases of PF were detected in May in Badaun. PF malaria, which is considered as rare in the region, can be fatal if treatment is delayed beyond 24 hours after the onset of clinical symptoms, said officials.

Bareilly district malaria officer D R Singh said, \u201cAs the maximum temperature is hovering around 40 degrees centigrade, most of the waterlogged pits have dried up due to intense heat. It has affected breeding of mosquitoes and reduced their density. We are utilizing this time by screening more patients and giving them immediate treatment.

On Friday, villagers spotted smoke billowing out of the ground in the forest land near Belpahada village under Mohammadi block. When they rushed to the spot, they saw cracks in the soil and flames beneath it were clearly visible. The ground was hot. Forest department officials were called and they identified the phenomenon as sub-surface fire. Sub-surface fires are of low intensity, consuming organic matter beneath and surface litter of forest floor, including plant roots, humus and peat. This fire spreads very slowly and in most cases, it becomes very hard to detect and control such type of fires. They may continue to burn for months and destroy vegetative cover of the soil.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency.

She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony.

Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The three-day service that began on Wednesday saw a ridership of 100 people, officials said on Friday. Under the PMAY initiative, the government aims to provide affordable housing for urban poor with a target of building 20 million houses by March 31, 2022. According to officials, only 300 people have got registered for residential flats after paying the registration fee while many have not turned up to pay the installment amount. At present, around 400 flats have been completed while the construction of more flats is underway. However, the BDA officials said the affordable houses constructed at Ramganfa Nagar has not found many takers due to its distance from the city. The BDA is currently accepting registrations at the special camps organised at its office and the last date of registration is June 15. People can avail free bus service to visit the site till the last day of the camp, said officials. Speaking to TOI, BDA secretery AK Singh said, \u201cMany have availed the bus service which was launched by BDA to facilitate people and provide them a view of the houses. The move is aimed at providing conveyance to people interested and willing to buy the houses. As the Ramganga Nagar Awasya Yojana is located on the outskirts of the city, many people feel reluctant to visit the site and due to this, the residential scheme hasn\u2019t been popular among the public. Thus, to give it a boost, we have been providing free trip for the people.\u201d He added, \u201cWith last date of the registeration approaching, the number of people visiting the camp has risen. Around 100 people were taken to visit the site through the special bus over the last two days. Since the location is far from the city limits, only one ride is possible. We may increase the trip based on the requirement on the final day.\u201d BDA officials hope that the move will help in quick booking of the houses under the scheme. Ram Singh, a resident of Sindhu Nagar said, \u201cThe residential plots are located on the outskirts. It is around 20 km far from my house. I have just learnt that tomorrow is the last day to avail of the bus service.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

According to health officials, when a team conducted random inspections, it found larvae of Aedes mosquito in the premises of four people residing in quarters near Shyamatganj flyover. The team also found larvae in a private hospital situated on Stadium road. D R Singh, district malaria officer, said, \u201cWe have served notice to people on whose house or hospital larvae was found. They have been asked to maintain cleanliness. Our team will again inspect these places after a week. If they are again found flouting rules, we will ask Bareilly Municipal Corporation to impose a fine on them.\u201d Meanwhile, the health department has been conducting a survey on density of mosquito pre-monsoon and post-monsoon in several parts of the district to ascertain which areas are more prone to vector-borne diseases.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Satta King 2019": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-satta-matka/articleshow/65670358.cms", "description": "NEW DELHI: Satta Matka is a form of gambling or lottery that had originated before the Independence of India.Originally, the game of Matka gambling involved betting on the opening and closing rates of cotton as transmitted to the Bombay Cotton Exchange from the New York Cotton Exchange, via teleprinters.The modern-day Matka gambling/ Satta King is based on random number selection and betting.

As these doctors boycotted OPD (out-patient department), many patients were forced to return home after they were denied treatment. The strike was called in support of the demand to provide safe working environment to doctors in the wake of the attack on Dr Paribha Mukharjee at NRS Medical College in Kolkata by a mob. By evening, there were indications that the medics would call off their strike after having met Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. However no formal announcement was made for calling off the doctors\u2019 strike. But throughout Monday, patients had to bear the brunt of protest after doctors stayed away from OPD in private hospitals, nursing homes, clinics and private medical colleges in Bareilly. Most of the hospitals wore a deserted look throughout the day. Sanjay Mishra, who lives near Choupla, said, \u201cMy eight-year-old son has high fever and I took him to a hospital in Rampur Garden but no doctor was available due to the strike. I later purchased general medicines from a medical shop. I will visit the hospital on Tuesday for correct treatment.\u201d A homemaker, Vineeta Katheriya who lives in the Subhash Nagar, said, \u201cI have been having a backache since Sunday night and it aggravated on Monday. As I was aware about the doctors\u2019 strike, I stayed at home and will consult a doctor on Tuesday.\u201d Though private doctors shut OPD services, there was no significant increase in footfall of patients at government hospitals. Chief medical superintendent of district hospital, Dr KS Gupta, said, \u201cIn comparison to June 10 (last Monday), there was rise of nearly 200 patients on June 17. As private doctors catered to patients in the emergency, there was no impact of their strike in our hospital.\u201d Dr Raghvendra Sharma, vice-president of IMA\u2019s Bareilly unit, said, \u201cWe attended critical patients and those admitted to the emergency ward. We took out a march from IMA building to Chowki crossing and sent a memorandum to Prime Minister Narendra Modi through Bareilly district magistrate for enacting a law for providing a safe working environment to doctors.\u201d The protesting doctors in Bareilly also burnt an effigy of Kolkata chief minister Mamata Banerjee. In Pilibhit, private doctors observed a day-long strike but attended to emergency cases. They took out a protest march in Pilibhit city by donning helmets. Apart from 55 IMA doctors, 65 doctors under the aegis of National Integrated Medical Association (NIMA) also joined the strike on Monday. District general secretary of IMA, Pilibhit, Dr Deepak Kumar Gangwar, said they would be compelled to resort to stern measures if the government did not pay heed to their demand for setting up a three-member committee to ensure the safety of doctors and to enforce action against miscreants in case of any violence at their medical establishments.

While in Shahjahanpur district, a 13-year-old girl was allegedly raped by two youths after breaking into her house in a village under Khutara police station limits. The crime is said to have occurred on June 7, but police allegedly didn\u2019t lodge any complaint turning her parents away when they reached the police station. The FIR was only lodged after the girl\u2019s parents met the superintendent of police S Chinnapa on Thursday and he instructed the station house officer to do so. In the case under the Nawabganj police station, the accused man, who came on a bicycle, told her that her father was calling her to the field and took her to a secluded place where he allegedly raped her and fled after dropping her near the house. Police have lodged an FIR and are conducting raids to nab the accused. Superintendent of police (rural area) Sansar Singh said that the rape survivor\u2019s father and uncle had gone to the field leaving her at home with her mother.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. He defeated Congress's Ramnaraian Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently concluded general election. He has also been elected to Rajasthan assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. Birla will succeed eight-term MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this will not be for the first time a relative newcomer will hold the position. In 1996, TDP leader G M C Balayogi was also a two-time MP when he was elected as the LS Speaker and after his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and the first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

Soon a team of forest and administrative officials visited the spot and found that the smoke was a result of sub-surface fire. Sub-surface fires are of low intensity, consuming organic matter beneath and surface litter of forest floor, including plant roots, humus and peat. This fire spreads very slowly and in most of the cases, it becomes very hard to detect and control such type of fires. They may continue to burn for months and destroy vegetative cover of the soil. There are four revenue villages in the radius of two kilometers from the forest land. This has sparked fears that if not controlled, the sub-surface fire will consume forest wealth, affect wildlife and people living in the vicinity. According to local villagers, they observed smoke in Jamuniaghat beat of Mohammadi forest area, spanning 25 acres. There were cracks in the soil and flames beneath the soil were clearly visible. The ground was hot. Bur forest department assured villagers that necessary action would be taken to douse the sub-surface fire at the earliest. Divisional forest officer, South Kheri forest division, Samir Kumar informed his superiors about the fire so that steps can be taken for preventing any damage to forest and human habitat. Mohammadi forest range is a social forest region but has carnivores and herbivores along with rich flora. Tehsildar Vikas Dhar Dube, who also visited the village with his team, said, \u201cWe are inspecting the area to identify if such signs are visible elsewhere.\u201d Kumar told TOI, \u201cThis could be an extremely dangerous situation as we are not aware about the total area where the underground fire has spread. We are planning to dig a large pit using JCB machines to douse the underground fire. However, it will be done after seeking permission from seniors and receiving expert advice. Our priority is to ensure safety of flora and fauna of the forest and that of local people.

Asked about Congress' Delhi unit president Sheila Dikshit's remarks that Kejriwal never approached her for an alliance, the chief minister said, \u201cWe have met Rahul Gandhi. Dikshit is not that important leader.\u201d Kejriwal has been urging the Congress to stitch an alliance in Delhi for the Lok Sabha polls to keep the BJP away from power. Leaders in the Delhi unit of the Congress were divided over the issue of alliance with Dikshit and her three working presidents opposing it, party sources had said. A top source in the party had recently said that chances of alliance were \"slim\" considering its long term repercussions in Delhi. \"The biggest question is how will Congress face the AAP in Assembly elections due in 2020 after the tie up. Also, the party does not gain much politically as it is being offered only 2-3 seats by Kejriwal,\" the source had said. Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections in Delhi. The talk of alliance was fuelled by the fact that the Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP that had walked away with all the seven seats in the national capital. Delhi has 7 Lok Sabha seats and it will go to polls on May 12.
