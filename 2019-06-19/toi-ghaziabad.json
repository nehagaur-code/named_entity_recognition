On May 29, 2019, Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) cancelled the allotment of a 11,503-square-yard plot to IMT after it found out that the institute had illegally encroached upon it. IMT challenged the order in court, stating that it came to know about it through media. A bench headed by Justice Manoj Misra and Justice Saurabh Shyam Shamshery has directed IMT to deposit Rs 5 crore with the GDA by July 15 and submit an application, along with a copy of the receipt, before the principal secretary of UP\u2019s urban planning and development authority by July 25, seeking regularisation of the allotment of the land on which the institute stands. Meanwhile, the state government has been directed to take a \u201creasoned decision\u201d by the next date of hearing, August 28. \u201cThe decision so taken by the government shall be produced through an affidavit by either of the parties\u2026 It is further made clear that the state government will take its own decision without being influenced by any of the observations made in this order,\u201d the court said. It has also directed GDA to refrain from taking any coercive action against IMT. The matter came to light in March, 2019, after BJP councillor Rajender Tyagi accused IMT of encroaching upon the plot. IMT, in its petition, accepted that there might have been negligence on its part in pursuing formalisation of transfer and payment with respect to the allotment of the land but GDA had been equally negligent with respect to the cancellation of the allotment. It also promised to get the allotment regularised but said its cancellation would cripple the institute, which had been in existence for 40 years. However, according to the GDA counsel, the authority had repeatedly issued notices to IMT to deposit the allotment money.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray. UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey has been repeated from Chandauli.

A visit to Masuri\u2019s Nahal area revealed that the spot from where the children were jumping into the water is around 50 metre from Nahal Jhaal police post. But no policemen made an effort to stop them. Scores of onlookers had gathered near the edge of the canal on Wednesday to watch the children, some as young as nine-year-old, jumping into.

The court said the petitioners have the freedom to approach appropriate authorities regarding ownership of the land. While hearing a case filed by environmentalist Sushil Raghav, who had contended that about 50% of the lake has been encroached upon, NGT, on Tuesday, said the court is not deciding the title issue. \u201cThis court is only considering the environmental issues with a view to protect the water bodies which were encroached upon by unauthorised persons and unauthorised encroachments made by miscreants so as to reduce the water bodies into their possession. Under the circumstance, we do not think that it is necessary to implead the applicants in the execution proceedings. They are at liberty to move the appropriate forum to establish their rights in accordance with the law,\u201d the court order stated. The NGT, in September 2016, had ordered that the lake area be cleared of illegal structures and its sanctity restored. In 2017, Raghav filed a contempt plea in the case and the court heard the matter on April 22 this year, in which authorities sought more time, saying that since the election process was on, it would be difficult to get police force to carry out the drive. Later, the district authorities carried out an anti-encroachment drive on May 29 and demolished some structures. Subsequently, applications were moved by residents seeking impleadment and stay of proceedings. Applicants had argued that orders had been passed without hearing their grievances. They claimed they were not encroachers and had purchased properties on the basis of registered sale agreements and deeds and the areas were registered as private holdings in revenue records and it is not part of the water body. Now, when the authorities are implementing the NGT order by demolishing the buildings where applicants stay, saying these are illegal encroachments, residents have pleaded for impleading them as respondents in the case. Applicants also requested a stay on eviction proceedings. Last week, police booked 35 people for buying and selling plots and building houses on encroached land near Arthala lake in Sahibabad after Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation filed a complaint. They were booked under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 447 (criminal trespass), 448 (house-trespass), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the IPC and sections 2 and 3 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.

To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option. We need to see how this will pan out.\" In Video:Bill seeking to lift green card cap amended to protect US workersDownload The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."}, "Ghaziabad municipal dump": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//citizen-reporter/stories/ghaziabad-municipal-dump/articleshow/62275526.cms", "description": ""}, "Lok Sabha Poll 2019": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections-2019/uttar-pradesh/news/poll-battle-2019-electioneering-hits-new-low-in-up-leaders-resort-to-personal-attacks/articleshow/68612027.cms", "description": "LUCKNOW: With electioneering for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls gaining steam in Uttar Pradesh, political leaders are increasingly resorting to personal attacks on their adversaries. If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16. The quotes loosely translate to \"Pappu says he wants to become prime minister. Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu ... and now 'Pappu's Pappi' has also arrived.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes. Considered to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, he was reportedly at loggerheads with Latur district guardian minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar. The nomination of Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, from Ahmednagar instead of Gandhi was a foregone conclusion ever since he joined the party last week. Sujay, a neurosurgeon by profession, will be making his entry into politics with this nomination.

The court said the petitioners have the freedom to approach appropriate authorities regarding ownership of the land. While hearing a case filed by environmentalist Sushil Raghav, who had contended that about 50% of the lake has been encroached upon, NGT, on Tuesday, said the court is not deciding the title issue. \u201cThis court is only considering the environmental issues with a view to protect the water bodies which were encroached upon by unauthorised persons and unauthorised encroachments made by miscreants so as to reduce the water bodies into their possession. Under the circumstance, we do not think that it is necessary to implead the applicants in the execution proceedings. They are at liberty to move the appropriate forum to establish their rights in accordance with the law,\u201d the court order stated. The NGT, in September 2016, had ordered that the lake area be cleared of illegal structures and its sanctity restored. In 2017, Raghav filed a contempt plea in the case and the court heard the matter on April 22 this year, in which authorities sought more time, saying that since the election process was on, it would be difficult to get police force to carry out the drive. Later, the district authorities carried out an anti-encroachment drive on May 29 and demolished some structures. Subsequently, applications were moved by residents seeking impleadment and stay of proceedings. Applicants had argued that orders had been passed without hearing their grievances. They claimed they were not encroachers and had purchased properties on the basis of registered sale agreements and deeds and the areas were registered as private holdings in revenue records and it is not part of the water body.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

The NHAI official in a meeting convened by divisional commissioner Anita Meshram in April this year had claimed that in June, UP Gate to Vijay Nagar portion of DME will be thrown open, but now the NHAI is saying that the deadline have been further extended to July. \u201cThe delay has been attributed to shifting of transmission lines on at least three points on the stretch. The electric poles which has to be transported from Kolkata has not reached,\u201d said RP Singh, project director, NHAI. \u201cWe most likely will be in a position to open the said portion by July which is delay of one month,\u201d added Singh. This is the fourth occasion that the opening of said portion has been delayed. In March the NHAI had claimed that the portion will be opened which was again changed to April and then in May and now in June. According to Singh the construction work for the entire phase II package which is from UP Gate to Dasna stretching and is 19.2km is about 52% complete while from UP Gate to Vijay Nagar is about 55% complete which includes about seven underpasses between them. All along 10.5km of stretch between UP Gate to Vijay Nagar there are seven underpasses of dimensions 2mX15mX5.5m and three light vehicle underpasses. \u201cAs far as integration of traffic from Indirapuram, Sidharth Vihar and Vijay Nagar on Ghaziabad side and from Noida on other side is concerned it will happen through these underpasses which fall under this stretch,\u201d said Singh. \u201cWhile these underpasses will ensure seamless movement of traffic to Noida and Ghaziabad, Delhi and Dasna bound vehicles will have to take curve which will lead to NH9\u201d added Singh.

The matter had come to light last month when a BJP councillor accused the GDA of turning a blind eye to the illegal use of the building. The GDA, in 1986, had leased out 3,838 sqm of land to Hindi Bhawan Samiti at a concessional rate solely for the purpose of promotion of Hindi language. However, its lease was cancelled in 2006 after the management of Hindi Bhawan, located in Lohia Nagar, was found to be indulging in commercial activities and also not paying the dues. GDA secretary Santosh Kumar Rai said, \u201cA notice to vacate the Hindi Bhawan premises was issued last month. Moreover, a month\u2019s time was given to its management to approach a suitable forum for redress of the issue, but they failed to get any relief. A GDA team went to the spot on Monday and took possession of the building.\u201d BJP councillor Rajendra Tyagi had highlighted the issue of Hindi Bhawan in May this year and alleged that its lease was cancelled in 2006 over non-payment of dues and violation of terms and conditions. Tyagi told TOI the Hindi Bhawan was developed by the GDA for promotion of Hindi literature, but the samiti went on to book and charge for commercial and other political activities against the rule. \u201cEven after lease cancellation, the committee continued with its commercial activities. Even the GDA failed to take any action,\u201d he added. At the time of lease allotment, the samiti was supposed to pay Rs 3.37 lakh to GDA but it paid only Rs 60,000. By 2006, the amount had increased to Rs 36 lakh, including interest, he said. The councillor had also accused the president of Hindi Bhawan, Lalit Jaiswal, and MLA Atul Garg, also a minister in the Yogi Adityanath government, of helping each other in wresting control of the bhawan.

Then one day, when I visited VK Singh\u2019s office, I told him about the incident. He said he had never given any such directions to anyone. He also told me he had removed SP Singh from his duties,\u201d Tyagi said. Ghaziabad SSP Upendra Kumar Agarwal said SP Singh had been booked under sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 467, 488 and 471 (forgery) of the IPC. \u201cWe arrested him from Old Bus Stand in Ghaziabad.\u201d SP Singh is a resident of Greater Kailash in Delhi and is originally from Ballia. Several cases of cheating and forgery have been registered against him in various police station in Delhi and Ghaziabad. In March 2017, the Enforcement Directorate had attached assets worth Rs 21.29 crore of a firm owned by him and others in connection with a money laundering case pertaining to alleged financial irregularities in supply of high-altitude tents worth Rs 22 crore to RAW to the security agencies during 2009-13. Two factories, a commercial property in Noida, a residential property in Lucknow and agricultural land in Ballia were also attached. Shivanshu Tyagi, a BJP member, had in March 2015 filed a police complaint against SP Singh, alleging he had bought a car in VK Singh\u2019s name on finance and sent it to his Lucknow residence. At that time, a case of fraud was filed against SP Singh at Kavi Nagar police station. VK Singh, who is currently minster of state for road transport and highways, had dismissed the advisor after the allegations came to the fore. \u201cThere is no representative of mine in my constituency at present,\u201d a PTI report quoted the minister as saying recently. The exact date when SP Singh was officially removed from VK Singh\u2019s team could not, however, be ascertained.

The proposed rates is Rs 100 per sqm a year against the existing Rs 10 per sqm a year. A proposal to revise the rates would be placed in the GDA board meeting scheduled to be held on 25 June. There are about 13 educational institutions that have been given park/green land \u2014 a total of more than 90,000 sqm. \u201cThe existing rates has remained unchanged since 2011 and prior to 2011, it was just one rupee.

In these cases, it becomes pertinent that while reviewing the lease, we will have to ascertain the extent of violation,\u201d Verma added. The misuse of parks leased out to institutions by the GDA was first highlighted by local councillor Rajender Tyagi. \u201cThere are many parks and green belts under educational institutions that have erected boundaries and merged those with the institutions, which is in violation of the norms,\u201d said Tyagi. \u201cThe GDA, for a long time, remained oblivious to these violations. As per the norms, institutions in no manner can bar common people from using these parks leased out by GDA,\u201d Tyagi added. \u201cAs a rule only 2% of park\u2019s land could be used for permanent construction.\u201d Verma said: \u201cWe are in the process of ascertaining to what extent institutions have violated the norms and only after that we will act to cancel the lease.\u201d Tyagi said schools are bound to provide parks for local children. \u201cAfter school, the institutions are required to offer theses parks and playgrounds to children of the neighborhood.

The proposal was cleared on Thursday at the GMC board\u2019s meeting, which passed the budget for 2019-20, pegging expenditure for the year at Rs 908 crore. The civic body said it expects to raise Rs 1,038 crore during the financial year.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

The data shows deaths due to accidents have reduced by 20% compared to the same period last year. It has recorded a three-year low in terms of the number of accidents, fatalities and injuries in the district from January to May. Last year, during the same period, the district saw 391 accidents, in which 187 died and 299 were injured. This year\u2019s records state 273 persons were injured in accidents. Interestingly, while in 2018 the city saw a decline in the number of accidents from January to May when compared to 2017, the annual figure showed an increase. In 2018, there were 1,134 accidents while in 2017, the number stood at 1,063. Most of the accidents took place in the evening, according to the data. \u201cMostly cars and bikes were involved in these accidents. Mishaps by cars were due to speeding, while bikes were mostly involved in hit-and-run,\u201d said a traffic policeman. SP (traffic) S N Singh said, \u201cOverall, it\u2019s a positive turn as accident cases have reduced. We have identified the areas where maximum number of accidents take place. We have not only ensured proper lighting there, but also installed speed reflectors. Both in urban and rural areas of the district, the accident rate has gone down, as people are more aware of road safety. We are planning to install more CCTV cameras in rural areas to track speeding vehicles,\u201d Singh said. The SP also said that speeding and wrong-side driving is a major cause of concern. \u201cSoon, there will be 550 officers who will manage traffic in the district. I will deploy more officers in those areas where we record the maximum wrong-side driving. In rural areas, we will start issuing challans to those who flout rules,\u201d Singh added.

Heavy and light vehicles accounted for 20% of accidents,\u201d a senior officer said. Moncy Varges, president of Safe National Foundation, an NGO, told the TOI that fewer accidents have taken place this time as roads have become better. \u201cPeople aged between 16 and 35 drive at a high speed and do not take road alignment into consideration.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. He defeated Congress's Ramnaraian Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently concluded general election. He has also been elected to Rajasthan assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. Birla will succeed eight-term MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this will not be for the first time a relative newcomer will hold the position. In 1996, TDP leader G M C Balayogi was also a two-time MP when he was elected as the LS Speaker and after his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and the first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.
