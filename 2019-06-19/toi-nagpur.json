With almost 50% RTE seats in Nagpur district remaining vacant, authorities are hoping that all selected parents complete the admission process so that the gap can be bridged further. Out of the total 7,204 RTE seats in the district, only 3,714 could be filled. In the second round, 2,731 students have been offered seats for which the admission deadline is June 27. However, it is almost guaranteed that RTE seats will remain vacant in many schools as majority of the parents try for branded English medium schools. In fact, in Nagpur the applications received were more than 300% of the seats available. But many applications get rejected because of improper address being mentioned or documents not being in order. There have been many cases of parents \u2018shifting\u2019 their residence close to a well known school so that they become eligible for RTE under the distance criteria. In RTE, preference is given to students who reside closest to the school. But many issues related to mapping of address in the online application form also created multiple issues. NGO RTE Action Committee had filed official objections over the address mapping in the online software as many admissions had been rejected because of this. Following these issues, the education department formed a verification committee which comprised of its own officials plus other experts. This committee then scrutinizes applications that have been rejected and ensures that it has been done so only due to valid reasons.

Power consumption has reduced by 52.41% even though the project is yet to be completed. NMC said 1.28 lakh of total 1.43 lakh street lights have been converted from sodium vapour to LED. The civic body is planning to finish the work on remaining 15,000 street lights within a month. An NMC official told TOI the power bill for street lights has come down to Rs2.28 crore per month (Rs27.36 crore per annum) from earlier billing of Rs4.35 crore per month (Rs52.20 crore per annum). This is a saving of Rs2.07 crore per month (Rs24.84 crore per annum). \u201cThe power bill will further reduce once the entire project is completed,\u201d he said. NMC has replaced 60 watt sodium vapour bulb with 36 watt LEDs on internal roads, and 60 watt, 105 watt and 120 watt sodium vapour lamps on major roads, squares and playgrounds with 285 watt LEDs. Apart from saving power by conversion into LED, NMC has installed a system where street lights are dimmed by 40% by 10pm and 50% by midnight. This is done automatically. NMC officials added the automatic switch-on and switch-off system will further reduce power consumption of street lights. \u201cUnder the same project, we will install a system to automatically start street lights after sunset and switch-off by sunrise. Also, timings will be set properly in the system,\u201d he said. For decades, street lights have been seen burning well before sunset, especially during summer days, wasting power. The total cost of the LED project is Rs470 crore of which Rs277 crore is for installing LED systems. Also, NMC aims to ensure majority street lights are included in the project. NMC is spending Rs59 crore on infrastructure development, where old power cables and street light poles will be replaced. Also, NMC is spending Rs28 crore for new street light infrastructure on under-construction Inner Ring Road and Metro rail corridors. NMC is executing all these works through eight private companies. It is mandatory for the companies to operate and maintain the street lights for 99 months, for which they will be paid Rs106 crore. With all these works, NMC is confident of proper functioning of street lights. An NMC official said the project will lead to a profit for the civic body. \u201cNMC will get LED street lights, new infrastructure and systems without spending anything. Entire cost of the project will be recovered from savings in power bills and high cost of current annual maintenance,\u201d he said. However, the project has been delayed to some extent due to delays in getting permission from the state government for seeking loans, ongoing works on Inner Ring Road Cement Concrete project, flyovers and Metro Rail. The works to install LED street lights was supposed to be completed by August 2018. NMC has also issued work orders to private companies for operating all these street lights on solar. Expense on power bill will go down further while also benefiting the environment.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

Scania has also gone in for arbitration in its dispute with the civic body regarding termination of service. After discontinuing the service on August 13, 2018, Scania has kept its 25 buses at a yard in Hingna MIDC. TOI learnt Scania was shifting buses to another place a couple of days ago. When NMC officials checked, they found only one bus at the yard. \u201cScania should have informed NMC before shifting the buses.

City MP and Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari had held a series of meetings with Scania officials to resume the service. It was his pet project. NMC had launched the project as it was suggested by Gadkari. However, Scania refused to resume the service. NMC then planned to restart it by roping in a new operator. Plan was that the new operator will buy buses from Scania. Sources added talks between NMC and Scania failed as the latter refused to sell buses at depreciated value. \u201cPune-based Travel Time Car Rental Pvt Ltd, one of NMC\u2019s red bus operators, had agreed to buy the buses and restart service. Plan could have materialized if Scania had agreed to sell buses at depreciated value,\u201d the sources said. In an another shocker for NMC, Scania has gone in for arbitration. Before discontinuing the service, Scania had filed a petition in the district court and succeeded in getting an order to restrict NMC from forfeiting its bank guarantee of Rs 7.50 crore. NMC then began efforts for a settlement. Scania had demanded payment with GST which the NMC refused. Therefore, NMC did not pay anything to Scania from July 1, 2017, till termination. NMC was confident of resolving payment issues with Scania as well as resume the service. NMC officials said counsel AR Patil has been appointed arbitrator to resolve issues. \u201cScania filed a petition in High Court seeking arbitrator. HC ordered appointment of arbitrator on April 26,\u201d the officials said. Scania did not respond to TOI\u2019s mail seeking comments. Former mayor and corporator Pravin Datke said appropriate action will be taken against Scania as well as the officials of NMC\u2019s city transport department. \u201cNMC has bank guarantee of Rs 7.50 crore and payment of Rs 11 crore. We will check legal provisions and take action againt Scania.\u201d \u201cIt is very unfortunate that Scania did not even give any intimation to us. The officials are also equally responsible for this. In fact, the negligence of officials resulted into discontinuation of the project. I will request the civic chief to initiate action against responsible officials immediately,\u201d he said.

In the near seven-decade history of orange plantations here, this is the first time that an alarming 60% orange orchards have gone completely dry and, for all purposes, died this year. The loss is stark in Warud tehsil of Amravati district followed by Katol and Narkhed tehsils of Nagpur district. For the first time, big and rich farmers are talking about selling off their lands and switching to other occupations. The vagaries of weather, scanty and erratic rains in last two years coupled with prolonged high temperatures throughout May and delayed pre-monsoon rains this year are responsible for this unheard-of plight of orange farmers. The loss caused to the ambia bahar crop alone (which fruits in September) is being pegged at about Rs1,620 crore. (mrig bahar, the other crop, fruits from February to April). However, the loss due to orchards (15-20 years) dying completely cannot be monetarily pegged. Shridhar Thakre, one of the Maha Orange directors and a big farmer, told TOI that he had stopped going to the orchards as he could not see the condition of the trees. He owns a 20-acre land with 3,500 orange trees in Talegaon village (Ashti) in Wardha district with irrigation facilities. But there is no water in the wells. The water table has gone below 1,000ft. \u201cIt is for the first time that the temperatures continuously hovered between 44 degrees Celsius to 47.5 degrees in the month of May. This year, there has been no pre-monsoon showers too. Neither the agriculture nor the revenue department has visited the orchards even once,\u201d said Thakre. Rajendra Thakre from Benoda Shahid village in Warud tehsil says he has incurred a Rs1.5 crore loss this year. \u201cI am 58 years old and have never seen such a situation in 30 years of agriculture. I have no option but to sell the land,\u201d he said. All four of Thakre\u2019s wells have gone bone dry. He tried bringing water from Paknala dam about 11km from the orchard by spending Rs18 lakh but the water in the dam too dried out soon. \u201cElectricity supply at odd hours \u2014 night and afternoon \u2014 doesn\u2019t allow proper irrigation,\u201d he said. Ramhesh Jichkar, who heads the Vidarbha Agriculture and Allied Producers Association and has oranges in 30 acres in Nagziri in Warud tehsil, says that 30% of his orchard has been affected. The water table here too has gone below 1,000ft. An average orange tree needs about 240 litres per day. \u201cPast three years has a rain deficit. Where will we get water from,\u201d he asked. Taj Khan, who has orchards in 200 acres and is a trader as well in Shahpur village, says that he deepened a water reservoir using own money so that \u201call can benefit but no rain means storage has been less\u201d. \u201cI have a farm pond too but when there is no rain there is no water to store too,\u201d he said. Small farmers from Madhav Taiwade (Jamgaon), Ganesh Dhote (Dawsa), Rambhau Kubade, Devnarayan Chaudhary and Durgabai Galbale (Umtha), Ramuji Deshbhratar (Arambi) \u2014 all in Narkhed Taluka \u2014 just point to their dry orchards. Among the many farmers TOI spoke with, only Manoj Jawanjal, a Maha Orange director and an organic orange grower, and Anil Junghare from Katol have managed to keep their orchards green. \u201cI have farm ponds and bore wells.

With the competition in this industry getting fiercer every day, the future of animation is huge and promising. Other than being an art of drawing cartoons, animation and multimedia have emerged as an industry with tremendous revenues. The excessive use of special effects has helped animation get a hold over movies, television and advertising sectors. It is one of the most concrete, lucrative and demanding career options which serves both entertainment and education industries alike. Those in this profession create animation and visual effects for films, video games, television, mobile devices, and other forms of media using illustrations and software programmes. Animators also create graphics and develop storyboards, drawings and illustrations. They create, plan, and script animated narrative sequences, and assist with background design as well as production coordination. If you are looking to enter this profession, the possible roadmap is to enroll into degree programmes or certificate courses offering exhaustive understanding of animation, graphics & web designing and multimedia. It is advised to build a portfolio in order to showcase artistry and creative and technical skills. Gaining work experience and maintaining your proficiency is of utmost importance. Ashita Reuben, co-founder and creative head of Coffee Beans Studio, said the best part about the job is feeling satisfied at the end of the day and receiving praise from clients. She said, \u201cThe animation industry in India is expected to grow at a pace faster than any other industry. As a career option, it is a field where you can fulfil your dream of having fun as you work.\u201d The skills required to foray into this field include nurturing creativity and appreciation of aesthetics.

Work opportunities for quality animators and related professionals like graphic designer, multimedia and game developer, character designer, key frame animator, 3D modeler and layout artist exist in sectors of advertising, online and print news media, film and television, cartoon production, theater, video gaming and e-learning at large. This booming industry houses opportunities with government as well as private sectors. It has an open field of employment opportunities in animation studios as story board artists, animation or character artists, compositing artists, video and audio specialists, visualizing, texture and lighting artists and editors in film labs.

This challenging career allows you to work on a wide range of projects in various industries. To be successful you must be creative, detail-oriented, patient, and have the ability to see the product you are creating even before it gets put to paper or computer screen. If you enjoy being creative, can work independently, and enjoy bringing characters to life, animation may be a career choice worth considering. All the way, you are expected to be creative and artistic, with communication and time management skills. You must have computer expertise and the ability to use animation and video editing skills. Jobs related to your degree in animation include character modeller, rigging artist, animator, texture artist, games developer, graphic designer, illustrator, VFX artist, web designer Etc. Animation is a great way to make a living. It\u2019s an industry full of creative people who get excited about what they do. Starting out, expect to put in long hours to hone your skills. Be prepared to move around a bit to go where there\u2019s work. Be respectful of those you work with and you\u2019ll find many artists who are more than happy to share their knowledge and experience. The future for 3D animators as a career is wide and varied. It encompasses a wide range of industries, from working at a production studio, to small animation companies, to ad agencies, to video game manufacturers to enjoying job works as an independent freelancer. Design companies rely on logos and corporate animations. You\u2019d be amazed at how many television commercials and logos are 3D creations. Animation is opening in as many sectors you can think. You could also work at advertising agencies, design companies, animated television series, film doing background scene or creating animation web-series for YouTube or ad-series for social media. A few brave souls even decide to go it alone and make their own films. Most employers prefer to hire candidates who have a bachelor\u2019s degree or diploma in animation, computer graphics, fine arts, or a related discipline. Choosing a mentor with strong industry exposure is most important rather than just joining institutes with glossy makeups, theoretical classes, costly branding, interiors or happening environments. In the 25 years or so that I have been involved in animation, I have worked with over a dozen different studios ranging from 5 to 250 in staff. The one constant in all these studios is the human dynamism. All studios are successful because of the talent they collect. No matter what your role is, you should always be aware of those around you and learn from their collective experience. Animation, gaming and VFX is a collaborative process and everyone working on a project adds value. Respect others but don\u2019t be afraid to make your job count. If everyone does that, then you get a synergy that is impossible to describe.

One new building has also been constructed as per green building norms, and there are plans for 136 new green buildings in the region. PWD chief engineer Ulhas Debadwar told TOI the plan is to convert 1,500 existing government buildings into green buildings in entire state by 2021. \u201cSome 300 buildings were selected in phase-I, of which works on 201 has been completed. Works on remaining buildings are likely to be completed soon. Target is to cover 525 more buildings in phase-II across the state. MoU for phase-II was executed with GRIHA Council in the city recently,\u201d he said. Under PWD-GRIHA green building Initiative, MoU was executed between the two agencies for transforming 300 existing government buildings, including 121 from Vidarbha, into green buildings in January. The team from GRIHA inspected the buildings and suggested the works. Registration of buildings was done in February. PWD completed works on 201, including 80 in Vidarbha, in three months. GRIHA teams conducted inspection and gave ratings this month. PWD superintending engineer Vidyadhar Sardeshmukh told TOI PWD has also started construction of all new government buildings as per green building norms. \u201cTarget is to construct 201 new buildings, including 137 in Vidarbha, as per green building norms. Works on two buildings, of which one in Nagpur division at Chandrapur and other in Pune division, has been completed. We constructed Van Bhavan at Chandrapur under the project and got five-star rating,\u201d he said. Sardeshmukh added the building of Maharashtra National Law University (MNLU) being constructed by PWD near Waranga will be a complete green building. \u201cWe are constructing buildings at GMCH, Mayo Hospital and other locations too with the same concept,\u201d he said. Sardeshmukh said PWD transformed some historic existing buildings like Vidhan Bhavan, Rajbhavan, Ravibhavan, Hyderabad House etc in the city into green buildings under the project. \u201cMain objective is to reduce power and water consumption, ensure safe disposal of sewage and garbage, reduce carbon emissions, conserve environment, and increase life of the structures. We are replacing all lights with LED and laying reflective paint on terrace to reduce power consumption inside the buildings,\u201d he said. Sardeshmukh also said they plan to operate buildings on solar power after getting rating in phase-I. \u201cAlready, tenders for installation of solar power systems on 390 buildings have been floated in the state, of which 40 are in Nagpur division. Solar power systems will be installed in rest houses first like Ravibhavan, MLA Hostel etc in the city,\u201d he said. Sardeshmukh said PWD will save around 2,200MW per annum used in government buildings after completion of phase-I works. GRIHA Council, a not-for-profit society jointly established by the ministry of new and renewable energy, and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) has claimed phase-I works resulted in annual reduction of 2,721 tonne of carbon emissions, which is equivalent to eliminating 600 vehicles from the roads in the state.

On Tuesday itself a gypsy broke down during the evening safari, forcing a tourist to walk 4km inside the core jungle. Forest officials are exploring options of negotiating a good deal with banks or getting funds through some government scheme. Poonam Pate, NNTR deputy director (core) said, \u201cWe are trying to see if a discounted rate of interest can be negotiated for vehicle loans. They did a similar thing in Tadoba and we are trying to work along the same route.\u201d Another option for the forest officials is to dip into funds from some state or central government scheme. \u201cThat option is at a very preliminary stage and a bit of a remote possibility for now. But we are trying to find out if there is some kind of scheme where we can access funds for new vehicles,\u201d said Pate. There are 43 vehicles plying in NNTR with a majority of them in bad shape. Many consider it a miracle that these vehicles don\u2019t break down as often as they should. While pulling the plug on all these vehicles may seem the logical thing to do, forest officials say the solution isn\u2019t practical. \u201cThis would mean taking away employment opportunities from villagers who reside here. They are not in a position to invest their own money to buy new vehicles. In fact, some of them may not even be in a position to get it financed either. These are ground realities that one needs to keep in mind before taking any decision and that is why we are exploring options to help them,\u201d said Pate. Maintenance of vehicles to prolong their life is also out of the question at this point of time. Sources say these vehicles are literally running on \u2018prayers\u2019 and there is no scope for any kind of mechanical intervention to salvage the vehicles.

Jitendra Kukde, chairman of NMC\u2019s transport committee, mentioned this in his budget of Rs277.84 crore for 2019-20 presented before the standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane. The expected expenditure of the department will be Rs 278.41 crore. Now, Pohane will include transport panel\u2019s budget in his budget to be presented in the general body. Kukde has projected a revenue of Rs 90 crore from sale of tickets while remaining Rs 188.41 crore funding from standing committee. The panel chief said the department will earn Rs 25 lakh from bus shelters advertisements. Following the vision of Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari to promote ecofriendly public transport, Kukde has proposed to convert all 235 standard buses, 150 midi and 45 mini buses to run on CNG. Already the civic body had converted one bus to run on CNG, he said. Kukde also announced migration of all NMC\u2019s owned four-wheelers, including mayor\u2019s car, to CNG. \u201cBy end of this financial year, entire Aapli Bus fleet will run on CNG,\u201d Kukde claimed.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform.

In line with a nationwide strike called by Indian Medical Association (IMA), most doctors kept Outdoor Patient Departments (OPDs) of their hospitals closed for the day. Only emergency services and casualty wards were functioning. Diagnostic services and pathologies were also closed for the day. Doctors practicing ayurveda, homeopathy and other schools of medicines also kept their clinics closed to express solidarity with their counterparts practicing allopathy. While private doctors observed the strike, residents as well as senior doctors at Government Medical Colleges across the region worked with black ribbons on their hands. Nagpur, being a medical hub in Central India, receives patients from nearby areas of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Many patients coming from the rural parts of these states had to spend the day waiting in hospitals due to the strike. Emergency cases were given due attention and admitted to CCUs. \u201cSix emergency cases were admitted in Critical Care Unit (CCU) on Monday. Our intentions were clear that patients should not suffer due to our agitation. Patients who came for routine check-ups were given alternative appointments promptly,\u201d said Dr Anoop Marar, director of Orange City Hospital and Research Center. Paediatrician Dr Uday Bodhankar said that cases coming from faraway places were treated. \u201cPeople from other states come with serious cases to Nagpur. Moreover, paediatric cases are vulnerable and we cannot avoid them. So, several cases were treated, and many patients were admitted,\u201d he said. Nagpur IMA president Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala said doctors registered protest peacefully without creating problems for patients. \u201cThe one-day strike was peaceful. We made patients aware about the tough situation doctors face when patients\u2019 relatives take law in their hands. Services will resume from Tuesday morning, and patients earlier scheduled for check-ups on Monday will be given priority,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, members of IMA gathered at the IMA Hall on Monday morning, raised slogans and highlighted placards against the West Bengal government. \u201cDoctors usually do not stretch the agitations so long. We are there to serve the people. But the attitude of the state\u2019s chief minister was very disappointing. So, we had to take a stand nationwide,\u201d said Dr Sanjay Deshpande. Even as OPDs were shut, doctors kept hospitals and waiting areas open for patients. Hospital staff told them about the strike and arranged for alternate appointments. On Monday evening, resident doctors in West Bengal called off their strike as their negotiations with the state government were successful. IMA central committee will issue directives about the future course of action to local units on Tuesday. In Yavatmal, doctors took out a silent march. \u201cLeaders of various organizations strongly condemned the barbaric attacks on doctors on duty,\u201d said Dr Anoop Kothari, president of IMA\u2019s Yavatmal unit. The strike received support from social organizations like Junior Chamber, Rotary Club, Chamber of Commerce, Druggists Association, Maheshwari Samaj, Agrawal Samaj, Bar Association, Arogya Bharati, Banjara Sangh, and several others. In Chandrapur, doctors attached to IMA Chandrapur chapter kept all non-essential medical services, including OPDs, closed. IMA national working committee member Dr Mangesh Gulwade declared zero-tolerance policy against violence against doctors.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'.

Out of the Rs500 crore planned to be invested, Rs300 crore will go into setting up a bottling plant. Confidence Petroleum is at present a debt free company and would be funding it expansion through internal accruals apart from raising loans. On the listing at NSE he said it was pending because shares which formed a major stake held in his mother\u2019s name remained in physical form. Khara said that as his mother expired in 2011, it took time to settle the formalities related to the will after which the shares held in her name were dematised.

The murder, over rivalry on gambling dens which are now controlled by top goons in the city as cops are turning a blind eye on them, likely had taken place a day ago. Mohod, having two murder charges against him, is learnt to have suffered 39 stab wounds on his body. His murder may now trigger a gang war between his close aides and \u2018Beats group\u2019 whose members, including Abhay Raut, is suspected to be involved. The case has been transffered to crime branch. Mohod was kidnapped a day ago from a Saoji eatery allegedly by Raut and his aides in a car. Around 20-25 people had come to abduct Mohod in three to four cars. It is learnt both Mohod and Raut wanted to maximize profits from the gambling dens they were operating. Raut is learnt to be operating one at Kharsoli while Mohod\u2019s was at Dhamna. Sources said Raut wanted Mohod to amalgamate their illegal businesses and share more profits which Mohod was resisting. Raut possibly lured Mohod with an offer to see a new place at Kharsoli where they could start a new den. Mohod was with his friends Rupesh Bonde and others at the eatery near Outer Ring Road from where he was taken in a car. Later, his family members and friends got a call from a close aide of Mohod that he had been murdered. Police searched for him on Sunday but found nothing. A case of kidnapping was registered at Hudkeshwar police station in the wee hours of Monday. \u201cWe received a response from cyber team that both of Mohod\u2019s cellphones were showing presence near Vela Hari village. Shortly afterwards, we found his body on the roadside,\u201d said PI Sandeep Bhosale of Hudkeshwar police station. Raut, close to arrested gangster-turned-bookie Swapnil Salunkhe, is learnt to have inflicted 44 stab wounds on his last victim Palash Diwte in October last year. Though several other names had cropped up, Hudkeshwar police insisted Raut alone was responsible for the murder. Raut got bail in this case too. After his release, he began asserting his influence. Another theory is that Mohod had threatened one Dilip for having beaten Sarang Thaokar over certain monetary dues. A relative of Mohod said Sarang owed around Rs 1.5 lakh to Salunkhe that he had lost in cricket betting. Dilip, close to Salunkhe, was threatening Sarang when Mohod intervened. Mohod had taken Sarang to Salunkhe asking him not to bother him for dues any more. Despite Mohod\u2019s intervention, Dilip had thrashed Sarang which was not taken lightly by Mohod. Top goons like Diwakar Kottulwar and his aides are also operating a major gambling den at Fetri under Hingna police station. Following a dispute at his den, Mohod had kidnapped gangster Maroti Nuwah around two months ago at gunpoint. Diwakar too had ensured no other gambling dens came up in his vicinity. Mystery over Salunkhe\u2019s arrest four days ago Nagpur: Swapnil Salunkhe was arrested by Pachpaoli police on June 13 for an offence of assault on cops registered in 2017. He was earlier rounded up by crime branch in January 2017 but was let off after a senior officer intervened. His arrest in the same case one and half years later Salunkhe when there are 11 accused named is baffling. Two more brothers of dreaded gangster Ippa, Naushad and Irshad too are at large in the case. Salunkhe was not on good terms with Vijay Mohod who was murdered on Sunday. The prime suspect in the murder, Abhay Raut, is learnt to be close to Salunkhe.

R Bhonsale, joint director agriculture, Nagpur division, told TOI that the survey can be done only on directions of the district collector. \u201cWe have no such instructions yet,\u201d he said. New state agriculture minister Anil Bonde said that he took meetings of agriculture secretaries and directors, and told them to generate their own data on affected areas without depending on the revenue department. \u201cAgriculture department officials should remain connected with farmers and always have an estimate of any losses about all crops,\u201d he said. Though most farmers are claiming that their orchards incurred permanent damage, MS Ladaniya, the director Central Citrus Research Institute (CCRI), has denied it. \u201cIt is temporary drying. Even if a few green leaves are present on a tree, it can be revived through rain. But this is possible only in the areas where there is heavy and deep soil in orange growing areas in Morshi, Warud and Katol tehsils. Oranges in shallow and light soils will not survive such drought,\u201d he said. Ladaniya claims that CCRI had issued advisories to orange growers to thin the fruits (remove half fruits) from trees to reduce the loss on a tree. The institute had also suggested mulching (covering of the tree bottom by grass, straw or even plastic) to prevent evaporation losses. This helps conserve water near the roots. \u201cThe state government needs to take the issue seriously. Farmers should be advised to retain moisture in soil and spend more money on it. Last monsoon had a 23% deficit. If this persists, this year too the situation will be grave. There should be a water grid for proper distribution. It is an expensive proposition but is one of the solutions,\u201d said Ladaniya.

Mohod, having two murders and other offences against him including kidnapping of gangster Maroti Nuwah, was killed over operating gambling dens. He operated a gambling den at Dhamna and was opposing a new one at Kharsoli run by Raut, who now has three murder cases against him. Mohod wanted partnership in the gambling den at Kharsoli, which Raut wanted to expand. Mohod was taken to Kharsoli in a car by Raut, Karlawar and Nitin Tidke to see a place where the den could start soon. Karlawar was behind the wheels while Raut was seated beside him. Tidke, with whom Mohod had a fight at a bar at Butibori, was seated beside the driver. A heated exchange between Mohod and Raut suddenly led to the assault. Raut and Tidke repeatedly stabbed Mohod until he collapsed in the car, which is owned by a person identified as Vaid. Mohod\u2019s body was dumped near Vela Hari village and the assailants sped away.

The seminar concentrated on the teachings of Lincoln and the implementation of the same then and now. It also debated upon various ways, teachings and ethics taught to students nowadays. Senior journalist Shailesh Pandey, Mubarak Syed and Sandhya Pawar, both teachers were the panellists. Addressing the gathering, teacher Sandhya Pawar said, \u201c I want my students to be good human beings first. I don\u2019t want to make my students learn, I want to educate them.\u201d On a lighter vein, she said, \u201cI believe if mobile phones were invented back in the time of Lincoln, he surely would have recommended against it.\u201d Journalist Pande explained the topic to the audience and told them what it actually meant. He took the help of historical events like the American Civil War to explain his points as he went deeper into the subject. \u201cThe American Civil War was one of the greatest moral, constitutional and economic crisis in the world. Why? Because all men were considered equal except for South American men.\u201d Pandey said, \u201cLincoln effectively addressed many problems in the world including inequality among men.\u201d Picking up the topic right where Pandey left it, Mubarak Syed, \u201cPeople often ask me why I chose to become a teacher to which I reply that it was never my choice. My father wanted me to become one.\u201d Terming the role of a teacher as inspirational and motivational, Syed recalled an instance, \u201cI once said to one of my students \u2018you just walk forward ... I will be there behind you, supporting and encouraging you always\u2019. That\u2019s the sort of faith a teacher should instill in one\u2019s student.\u201d Rekha Dandige anchored the seminar. She explained the importance of a teacher in a child\u2019s life and compared him to a father. \u201c Like a father has a very important role in the upbringing of a child, similarly a teacher too plays a vital role in moulding a child\u2019s future,\u201d she said.

Around 160 students will receive financial assistance up to Rs3,000 and will be felicitated at special event scheduled for June 28.

Rajiv Behal, president of RCNV, said their focus was on enabling such students to continue their education. \u201cScholarships are given to students who struggle to continue education due to financial constraints as their families are unable to pay expenses and basic needs.

The hold-up at state level is because of growing concerns that the state board students will lose out on seats in good colleges because their CBSE counterparts have scored \u2018high marks\u2019 in the board exams. The state education officials have been brainstorming about various options to solve the problem, but so far nothing concrete has been done. Options such as considering only CBSE theory marks and increasing seats for 2019-20 academic session only are being discussed by officials. Academicians feel that this is an unnecessary controversy which is only hurting students. Reena Dargan, principal of Ira International School, said, \u201cFirst of all there is an assumption that CBSE schools have marked the papers leniently, which is incorrect. Everything is done as per the model answer paper. It\u2019s natural for confrontations to happen between two boards but to drag matters into a public forum is not done.\u201d Dilip Bose, general secretary of School Headmasters Charitable Association, said, \u201cThis delay is not only unwarranted but also detrimental for academic future of students. The delay in admission process means delay in wrapping it up. Then automatically, the classes will start late and we will struggle to finish the course on time. And if poor results come then who will be blamed?\u201d. Another senior state board school principal agreed that the issue was being blown out of proportion. \u201cWe had about 15,000-plus seats going vacant in Nagpur last year in Std XI, so why should there be such a hue and cry. There are ample seats available across all streams. There is no logical reason for people to stop the admission process,\u201d she said. In Nagpur, science students usually go by whatever their coaching classes say and take admission there. Even otherwise, in the city, the craze for specific college does not exist. Obscure junior colleges in city are known to have more than double the enrolment of old and \u2018branded\u2019 colleges, simply because of their tie-up with coaching classes. In this scenario, the delay of admission process in Nagpur does not seem logical. An education department employee, who did not wish to be identified, said, \u201cSince we are connected to the same admission software, the rules will have to be the same as well.\u201d If at all the state education officials decide to not consider CBSE\u2019s internal marks for Std XI admissions, then it will be the second major showdown between the two boards. The first was in 2011 when CBSE students who had appeared for the school-based exam in Std X were denied admission in Std XI of the state board junior colleges. At that time, the state board had raised questions about the credibility of school-based exam in which 100% marks were internally evaluated. The controversy ended only after a lobby group from Nagpur, that included parents, a cabinet minister and schools owners sorted out the issue with the then school education minister Rajendra Darda.

They pelted stones, smashing the window. They then dragged me out and tried to break my phone to delete the video. Luckily, local people heard my cries for help and came out. The boys then fled,\u201d Sengupta recalled.   She then called her father and sister; her own residence was just a lane away. They called cops, who came and asked her to file an FIR at the Charu Market police station. It was 1.30 a.m. when she reached there but, instead of taking down her complaint, the cops there directed her to Bhowanipore police station where the first assault had occured. \u201cI just gave up and started shouting at this point. There was no female police officer. The officer there finally took down my complaint after asking a lot of questions but refused to take the cabby\u2019s complaint, stating that two FIR could not be taken for the same incident,\u201d she said. Frustrated and hapless, she returned home. It was at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday that she posted the entire ordeal on Facebook along with a 20-second video clip. An additional CP later called Sengupta and assured her of strong action against not just the accused but an inquiry into police refusal to take her complaint citing jurisdiction issues. \u201cThe probe has just begun and we have identified all the culprits. More arrests are likely and we will probe whether there was lack of adequate response from cops,\u201d said a Lalbazar official. The arrested were identified as Sheikh Rahit, Fardeen Khan, Sheikh Shabir Ali, Sheikh Gani, Sheikh Imran Ali, Sheikh Wasim and Atif Khan alias Md Samsad. A preliminary inquiry revealed the cab had accidentally brushed against the bike, causing the riders to lose balance. One of the bikes\u2019 rear view mirrors broke and the youths accosted cabby Tarak Debnath to demand compensation. At least two more bikes and an auto carrying more people landed there, leading to the sequence of events ending with the assault at Lake Gardens, officials said.

Nagpur office specifically saw a 300% increase in the number of applications received for photocopies, which is the first step before students can apply for revaluation. The last date for applying for a photocopy ended on Monday. In Nagpur, over 5,000 students applied for photocopies of HSC while over 1,000 applied for SSC. In Amravati, over 1,700 HSC students applied for photocopies while only 1,000 did so for SSC. A senior board official said, \u201cThis time the rush for applications at Nagpur was extremely high. It was definitely more than three times of what we witnessed last year.\u201d TOI was the first to report about huge rush across the state for paper valuation as many science students saw their scores being extremely low in one of the core subjects. The Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association had issued a statement at that time saying their members have not made any mistake in evaluation, and the marks are just a reflection of how students performed on a particular day. With every subject\u2019s photocopy costing Rs400, the two boards in Vidarbha have raked in a minimum of Rs50 lakh in application fee. Madhusudhan Mude, president of Headmasters Association (HA) said the fee was too high and should have been brought down. \u201cMajority of the students apply for at least two subjects, some even go for three. This means that the board offices could have earned more Rs1 crore also. I think there is no reason for such a high application fee to be charged as most of the students in state board are not very economically strong so there is absolutely need for the board to be charging such an high amount,\u201d said Mude.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.

While 50% seats were already reserved under different categories, the introduction of 16% SEBC, 10% EWS and 5% has increased the total quota further. These students would also be allowed to apply under the remaining 19% seats in the open category. The staggering quota percentage may not have an impact on admissions to humanities and commerce faculty courses but it can greatly impact the prospects for open category in the science stream. During the 2018-19 academic session, MSc courses had received an overwhelming response with 3,764 applying for 1,966 seats while MA courses had got only 3,704 applications against intake of 13,016. The vacant seats under a particular quota would be transferred to another reserved category. The online CAP is applicable to all the 38 NU departments, and over 100 affiliated colleges for non-professional courses where admissions are not done by any other government agency. The number of seats in science faculty are likely to be same while humanities and commerce may see a drop due of ban on admission to 80 colleges. As of now, admissions to seven PG courses have opened while rest would be added when final-year UG results are declared. The NU had held back the announcement for the last 15 days mainly due to lack of guidelines on seat allocation under the new quotas from the government which has found itself in a tight spot over PG medical and dental admissions. While students were demanding release of the CAP schedule in June first week to ensure academic schedule compliance, colleges apprehended loss of admissions due to the delay. In phase-I, admissions to just seven courses have been announced. These are the same courses which were chosen for the pilot CAP last year when the process had kicked off in May last week itself. Last year, the CAP had begun on June 1 but dragged on till late September, just 15 days before the first semester exams, because of several anomalies, backlog students qualifying at the eleventh hour and colleges getting late permissions to admit students. The NU has started a separate portal for these admissions and students\u2019 facilitation centres would be opened at several colleges besides at NU\u2019s Amravati Road campus. The NU has already uploaded free of cost brochure carrying all the details of CAP process, intake capacity and course fee.

One of the biggest bloopers was the interchanging of SSC and HSC marks column in the portal which meant science stream students could not enter correct information. The problems were rectified later in the evening. A parent, who did not wish to be identified, said, \u201cIn the HSC marks column, they asked us to enter marks for both maths and biology. Since both fields were mandatory, we were not able to proceed further. It is obvious that students who appear for maths in HSC will not be going for biology.\u201d Another problem was faced while entering SSC marks because of a clause mentioned there. \u201cOn the screen, it was written that if you have not appeared for maths, science or english, then enter zero. But that is not possible since maths and science are compulsory subjects at SSC level. The only explanation is that the software is erroneously showing SSC fields on HSC page and vice versa,\u201d the parent said. Students also had problems entering their NEET marks. One of the students said, \u201cEntering the NEET scores basically allows me to be eligible for the 15% all India quota. But the portal was asking for marks scored in individual subjects, even though NEET authorities have only given us percentile. So, we are stuck and not able to proceed further.\u201d A student who had been trying to apply for engineering colleges said that it had become difficult to get doubts clarified as well. \u201cYou try calling on their helplines and see how many times somebody actually picks up. It\u2019s frustrating that they can\u2019t do anything without creating a mess,\u201d said the student. The CET cell authorities were well aware of the issues that their software is facing and had gone into the crisis-solving mode.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option. We need to see how this will pan out.\" In Video:Bill seeking to lift green card cap amended to protect US workersDownload The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."}, "\u2018India has just 2.4% of world\u2019s land but 18% of its population\u2019": {"datetime": "", "time": "2019-06-19 04:37:00", "description": "NAGPUR: India holds only 2.4% of total land surface but we host more than 18% of the world population.

Questions have been raised over NU\u2019s move since none of the stakeholders was informed about it even as the new academic year is set to start in a couple of weeks. While concerns have been raised over damage a hurriedly prepared syllabus may leave on NU\u2019s engineering education, this year\u2019s aspirants would be at a loss of not knowing the entire four-year syllabus. Last week, the proposal was tabled before the Board of Studies (BoS) to clear the move when one of the members reflagged it and demanded an elaborate deliberation. So far, only the first-year syllabus has been formulated. Mahendra Chaudhary, who is a BoS Applied Science and Humanities as well as Senate member, was shocked to know about the proposal. He refused to sign the proposal until the BoS allowed discussion on the new syllabus. \u201cI wrote to the vice chancellor expressing my concerns. We need to think about students from the region. The AICTE curriculum is meant for IIT-level students while our colleges have 45 percenters enrolled with them. Ideally, there should be been discussion spread over months. But, now at least faculty members need to be informed through some initiative,\u201d Chaudhary said. On his demand, the NU has agreed to organize workshops, which too has been alleged as a futile exercise. \u201cThe discussion is on the proposed syllabus which means the already decided one would be implemented. Only a handful of engineering faculty members were invited to formulate this new syllabus which is not in accordance with AICTE norms,\u201d some teachers told TOI. The discussions to be held at different colleges from Monday have been dubbed as eyewash since it would deliberate on the syllabus for just over two hours. As per the workshop schedule, the discussion would taken up after lunch between 2.30pm and 4.30pm. Those opposed to NU\u2019s abrupt move wanted involvement of all stakeholders since the start. Stakeholders involve parents, students\u2019 representatives, industry professionals, academicians apart from university officials and members. Surprisingly, the NU has kept the entire affair under wraps as it never bothered to invite suggestions and objections from stakeholders in the last one and half years. The AICTE had introduced the model curriculum in January 2018. The NU also never uploaded a single document or meeting notice on its website about the move. University\u2019s Vice chancellor SP Kane didn\u2019t respond to TOI\u2019s calls and SMS. The new curriculum envisages more weightage to region specific and skill-based learning. Over 60 credits too have been cut to encourage industry internships.

The Rs475 crore project is a form of European Train Control System (ETCS), which is a globally recognized system of upgraded signalling and communication to improve safety, speed and punctuality. The modernization project for signalling system, which includes the Automatic Train Protection System with Long Term Evolution (LTE)-based Mobile Train Radio Communication Technology (MTRC) along with electronic interlocking, is part of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by Indian Railways with RailTel Enterprises Limited (REL) this week. Apart from Nagpur-Badnera section in Central Railway, the project would be implemented on other stretches too like Renigunta-Yerraguntla (South Central Railway), Vizianagaram-Palasa (East Coast Railway) and Jhansi-Bina section (North Central Railway). All these are among the busiest routes in the nationwide railway networks. The project would be implemented on almost 500 locomotives on the earmarked routes. The Railway Board is learnt to have taken up the Rs1,609 crore project to implement the globally acknowledged Indian version of the ETCS (MTCS) to raise the standard of safety of passengers, and increase line capacity with modern signalling and communication system to match international standards. Maninder Singh Uppal, officiating Divisional Railway Manager (DRM), Central Railways, said the latest system is the upgraded version of the already existing one, which would remove any possibility of collision. \u201cSafety, punctuality and speed would be improved. The train would automatically stop if it crosses a red signal and it would also halt in case there is a possibility of head-on or side-on collisions,\u201d said Uppal. \u201cIf the manual application fails, the brake would be immediately applied after signal passing and danger. The speed of the train would also be reduced automatically depending upon the allowed sectional speed,\u201d he said. Uppal said the speed and punctuality would both be improved by 20-30%. \u201cThe railway traffic movement in the highly congested Nagpur-Badnera section would witness a considerable improvement,\u201d said the senior railway official. Uppal said the speciality of ETCS level-II is that it would ensure continuous monitoring of the train speed vis-\u00e0-vis requirements of stoppage and control based on the status of the signal. \u201cThe system works and is based on radio communication system between the loco pilots, guards, base stations and from there to the control centre, with the help of optical fibre cable. Any official within a section operating the train would be reachable through communication set,\u201d he said. Uppal also said the budget (Rs475 cr) has already been vetted, sanctioned and sent to REL by the zonal railway authorities. \u201cThe project would mostly involve experts from international stakeholders,\u201d he said. Railway Board authorities have said that speedy execution of the project is expected as REL is already engaged in collecting, collating and analysing inputs and feedbacks from industry representatives on various aspects of technology, interfaces, compatibility and inter-operability of various sub-systems.

Accordingly Vidarbha Taxpayers Association (VTA) called a general body meeting which was presided by JP Sharma to discuss and send suggestions to the finance ministry. President of VTA JP Sharma suggested that it is high time that central government brings in Direct Tax Code (DTC), wherein the accounting year should be rescheduled to January to December so that we match the universal pattern of accounting. Secretary Tejinder Singh Renu submitted that VTA has been constantly writing to finance ministry that threshold limit of direct tax should be raised from existing Rs2.5 lakh to Rs5 lakh in DTC; likewise the tax slabs should also be 10% for Rs5 lakh to Rs10 lakh salary, 20% for Rs10 lakh to Rs20 lakh and 30% above Rs20 lakh. More accountability on assessing officers should be introduced so that sense of responsibility is there on both the sides. Vice-president Shrawankumar Malu suggested that bank lending and its procedure has been too much rigid whereby even genuine borrowers, business houses and industries are facing tough times to manage financial deals. Hence it\u2019s highly recommended that finance ministry relaxes banking procedure to its realistic position wherein financial institutions as well as business can grow steadily. Likewise more liberty should be given to bank heads in same city itself so that file data transfer and delay is eliminated. Industrialist Surendrakumar Jaiswal suggested that threshold limit of Micro Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) should be increased from Rs10 crore to Rs50 crore. Furthermore definition of MSME of Centre and State varies which creates too many complex situations. Hence they should be common for factual growth of this sector. Saqib Parekh suggested that terminology of assessment year (AY) should be totally eliminated in DTC as this FY and AY creates too much of confusion for common man and with January to December financial year the year mention would also be single, which will bring much needed clarity. VTA members present in the meeting were treasurer Pawan Chopra, joint secretaries Hemant Trivedi and Amarjeet Singh Chawla, executive body members Ashvin Agrawal, CA Hemant Sarda, Govind Patel, Veeru Balani, Rahul Agrawal, Narendrapal Singh Osan, Pankaj Roshan, Harmanjeet Singh Baweja, Pratish Gujrathi and others.

Nagpur traffic police are now suspending driving licences of such offenders. In the five months this year, the traffic police have asked regional transport office (RTO) to suspend driving licences of 2,425 violators. These are for violations like over speeding, using mobile phones, carrying passengers in goods vehicles, signal jumping, drunken drive and unruly behaviour by autorickshaw drivers. Traffic police seized the licences and sent them to RTO for suspension between January 1 and May 31, 2019. In this period traffic police booked 34,625 drivers under these offences. So they have recommended suspension of licences for 7% drivers only. Traffic Police initially only seized licences of repeat offenders but now even first-time offenders will have their licences taken away for at least three months. The traffic police term this change a \u201csilent revolution\u201d. \u201cGiven that around 20 lakh vehicles ply on Nagpur\u2019s roads, we have kept one in 10 drivers away from the wheels for at least three months,\u201d a senior officer from the traffic branch said. According to the officer, Traffic Police had been recommending the cancellation of driving licences for a long time as per Motor Vehicles Act Sections 19 and 21, but it was nowhere close to the scale it is today. \u201cWe were cautious in implementing the stringent rule. We did it only in case of repeat offenders,\u201d the officer claimed. The officer also pointed out that even a Supreme Court-appointed committee had issued directions to seize driving licences for five grave traffic violations speeding, signal jumping, drunk driving, use of mobile phones while driving and carrying passengers in goods vehicles. According to data from traffic branch, driving licences of 1,494 people were suspended for driving under the influence of liquor, while licences of 397 have been suspended for jumping signals and 311 for using mobile phones while driving. Traffic experts called it a welcome step. They admitted lack of enforcement in city had increased violations manifold.

The event was organized to mark the 345th anniversary of Shivaji Maharaj\u2019s coronation. Vivek Ranade and Shivani Dani were the chief guests of the programme which was conceptualized by Praful Mategaonkar who spoke about all the forts, starting with Shivneri. The 17th century Shivneri fort is the birthplace of Shivaji and is located in Junnar, 90km from Pune. At the centre there is a pond known as \u2018Badami Talav\u2019 while on the south there are statues of Jijabai and young Shivaji. There is ample water in the fort as there are two round-the-year springs called Ganges and Yamuna, said Mategaonkar. \u201cLocated in Pune district, the large Torna Fort, also known as Prachandagad, was the first fort won by Shivaji at the age of 16. It\u2019s regarded as the first pillar of Maratha empire. It is the highest and most difficult fort to capture as it is equipped with \u2018zunjar machi\u2019 fortification,\u201d he said. About Rajgad fort, he said that it was formerly known as Murumdev, and was the capital of Maratha empire for 26 years, before Shivaji shifted the capital to Raigad Fort. The most historic place inside the fort is Padmavati Mati. Sinhgadh, 35km southwest of Pune, gets natural protection due to the steep hills. Even British army found it hard to capture, he said. \u201cThe Battle of Sinhgadh was fought between Marathas, led by a fierce general Tanaji Malusare and the Mughals. Tanaji lost his life in battle but his troupe won the fort. On hearing about Tanaji\u2019s death Shivaji said, \u2018Gadh aala, pan Sinh gela\u2019,\u201d he said. Initially known as \u2018Kondhana\u2019, Sinhgadh fort has two gates \u2014 Kalyan Darwaza and Pune Darwaza. later Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak had a historic meeting here. At 1,080 metres above sea level Pratapgadh, is famous for the battle between Shivaji and Afzal Khan. There is an Afzal tower which defends the approach towards the fort. Afzal Khan\u2019s body is buried under the tower and his dargah is located nearby,\u201d he said. About Sindhudurg fort, Mategaonkar said, \u201cLocated in Arabian Sea on the shore of Malvan town in Konkan region, Shivaji built the fort to counter the rising influence of foreign colonizers and negate the rise of Siddis of Janjira.\u201d \u201cRaigadh fort was the capital of Maratha empire. Shivaji had seized it from Raje Chandraraoji More in 1656. The fort has the Samadhi of Jijabai,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIn 1689, Zulfikhar Khan captured Raigad and later Aurangzeb renamed it as Islamgadh. Execution point \u2018Takmak Tok\u2019 can be seen clearly from the fort.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections. If the party leadership thought I was a rise to another dynast, they would not have considered me at all.

Advocate Ashish Jaiswal, former Shiv Sena MLA from Ramtek, had brought it to the notice of MWRRA that dead stock is being used without permission since last one month. In a big revelation, Jaiswal said the state government has not issued any written permission to use the dead stock. Jaiswal has filed a contempt petition against WRD, NMC, collector, and two more respondents with MWRRA. A five-member bench of MWRRA chaired by KP Bakshi held a hearing on the petition on Tuesday. In the petition, Jaiswal said using dead stock was a contempt of MWRRA order dated September 12, 2018. \u201cWRD has even allowed NMC to use more water than allocated from Totladoh reservoir. NMC did nothing to bring down losses or develop its own water sources,\u201d he said. Jaiswal told TOI, WRD and NMC committed a crime by using dead stock without permission. \u201cWRD and NMC officials failed to show any permission to MWRRA. It has come at the cost of lakhs of farmers, people, cattle and wildlife. I pleaded for appropriate action against all concerned persons from the five respondent agencies,\u201d he said. On May 14, mayor Nanda Jichkar had met CM Devendra Fadnavis and claimed to have received permission to utilize 30 MMC from dead stock. On the directives of MWRRA, WRD officials said NMC used 163 MMC as against allocation of 154 MMC as on Monday. \u201cTotal utilization of water for NMC will be around 170 MMC by June end,\u201d they said. MWRRA reportedly came down heavily on WRD and NMC for using more water than allocated. Jaiswal added NMC misled MWRRA on the quantum of non-revenue water (NRW). \u201cMWRRA asked NMC officials to inform it about current NRW. NMC officials said current NRW was 45%. Actually, NRW of NMC is much more than that. MWRRA passed strictures on NMC officials. NRW of NMC should have been 14% in current condition,\u201d he said. Jaiswal also brought it to the notice of MWRRA that NMC has failed to bring down high consumption. He said NMC was drawing and supplying much more water than norms and requirement. In the petition, Jaiswal said the respondents did not comply with one of the directives of MWRRA. \u201cNMC has not complied with direction passed by this authority by not carrying out the accrued assessment of groundwater potential with the help of Groundwater Survey and Development Agency, Pune, and Central Groundwater Board office at Nagpur.

Ganesh Tandulkar, an autorickshaw stand coordinator at Jhansi Rani Chowk, was allegedly hacked to death by a gang of fellow drivers on Saturday. The assailants were apparently enraged that he shielded a man they wanted to eliminate. The incident took place at Udibaba Chowk in MIDC. The MIDC police acted quickly in the Tandulkar murder case, arresting three assailants, Abhijeet Singh, Rakesh Kuryavanshi and Vicky Dabekar. Within hours, 22-year-old Gaurav Nagpure was stabbed to death by his rivals near a community toilet at Gangabai Ghat within the jurisdiction of Kotwali police station. Nagpure was attacked by his neighbours-turned-foe Tejas Bagde, Shoaeb Malik, Bobby Malik and others with sharp weapons over old rivalry. The injured Nagpure was rushed to hospital, where he was declared dead. Later in the evening, city and rural police set off on another chase when news of a murderous assault on gangster Viju Mohod started doing the rounds. Sources in the police said Mohod, who had kidnapped gangster Maroti Nuwa around two months ago, was apparently kidnapped from an eatery by close aides of another gangster, and thrashed up very badly. Staffers from Beltarodi, Nandanvan, and Sakkardara police stations of city, and Kuhi in rural, started a frenetic search to track down more information. Mohod had a dispute with another goon, identified as Amit Bilge, some days back, which was settled at marriage of one Bobby. Despite this, Mohod had been attacked by his rivals, and was in critical condition at hospital when reports last came in. The mastermind of the gang that attacked Mohod had been arrested by Pachpaoli police in an offence registered in 2017. In the same offence, the gangster had been freed even after being nabbed by crime branch, due to alleged political influence and support of a builder. In the Tandulkar murder, police said the assailants wanted to eliminate one Dinesh Pandey, also an autorickshaw driver, to teach him a lesson for confronting them earlier in the day. The three assailants are trying to establish their dominance at the autorickshaw stand, and Pandey had abused Singh in a lighter vein earlier in the day. It\u2019s learnt that Tandulkar, whose cousin is posted at crime branch, too had a wordy duel with Vicky earlier in the day. Later, Pandey and Singh, who were once classmates, exchanged abuse at the autorickshaw stand at Rani Jhansi Chowk. They were separated by Tandulkar before he left to attend a family programme at Timki. In Tandulkar\u2019s absence, Dabekar assaulted Pandey with a sword on his right shoulder. Pandey went to a hospital at Hingna and informed Tandulkar and another autorickshaw driver Chandrakant Bhagwat. Tandulkar and Bhagwat rushed to the hospital, picked up Pandey and dropped him home safely. Some time later, Tandulkar got a call on his cell phone from Kuryavanshi, who summoned him to Udibaba Chowk. Kuryavanshi and Dabekar wanted Tandulkar to call Pandey too at the spot. Tandulkar reached the spot but kept pleading with the assailants to forgive Pandey and forget the incident. As Kuryavanshi and Dabekar started getting aggressive, Tandulkar tried to sneak away in Bhagwat\u2019s autorickshaw. But Kuryavanshi and Dabekar attacked Tandulkar, and while Singh thrashed Tandulkar, Dabekar assaulted him with a sword. MIDC police have registered an offence of murder against four persons, including the three already in custody.

State women and child development minister Pankaja Munde also condemned the incident in Mumbai, and assured action against the accused. At Arvi, the Bhim Tiger Sena (BTS) demanded stringent action against the accused, and handed over a memorandum to district collector and sub-divisional office on Monday. The incident has been condemned by many organizations on social media too. Aryan Khadse, 8, a resident of Rani Laxmibai Ward of Arvi town, was accused of stealing some coins from a temple by accused Umesh alias Amol Dhore. The accused punished Aryan by forcing him to sit on hot tiles on Saturday afternoon, which caused serious burn injuries on his buttocks. Aryan is admitted at Arvi general hospital. On Monday, the state office of the NSSC, at Pune, wrote to the Wardha collector and superintendent of police, asking for a report on the incident. Attaching a printout of the story published in the TOI, the commission has asked for the factual details of the case. The BTS claimed in its memorandum that the incident happened out of hate \u2018as victim entered temple\u2019. The boy belongs to Matang community and was punished by Dhore, who belongs to OBC, they said. To stop such incidents in future, BTS demanded stringent action against accused Dhore. However, residents of Rani Laxmibai Ward reiterated on Monday, on condition of anonymity, that the children play in the temple yard every day, and no one has ever raised any objections. A resident said there is no caste discrimination, but the accused sells illicit liquor, and always creates trouble for children. He added, \u201cI think the accused never dreamt of the consequences while punishing the child.\u201d BTS district president Atul Diwe said the boy\u2019s parents have objected to the horrible punishment. \u201cIf accused wanted to punish the child, he could have told the parents.

The clean air action plan was prepared by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) with support from National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) and the NMC has taken up the lead in its implementation. The seminar was inaugurated by mayor Nanda Jichkar and municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar. Setting the context for the seminar, India director of CAA Prarthana Borah said, \u201cSince the clean air action plan has been approved by the CPCB, it is now time to deliberate over its implementation. The major problem lies in developing cities as there is increased constructional dust and emissions due to improper waste management deteriorate the air quality.\u201d Borah said that the objective of organizing the session was to engage in a discussion regarding sustainable urban development and clean technology for clean air. Bangar emphasized on the need to take account of the vulnerable sections of the city as all localities are not affected equally.

These include two in Vidarbha at Amravati and Buldhana. Medical education minister of Maharashtra Girish Mahajan told TOI Ministry of health and family welfare had given an in-principle approval to state government\u2019s proposal to upgrade seven district hospitals in state into medical colleges. \u201cI had a very fruitful meeting with Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan last week. He has sanctioned many proposals given by the state\u2019s health education department. These include seven GMCs and several research institutes. This will bring in 3,670 more MBBS seats and nearly 800 PG seats in the state in the long run,\u201d Mahajan said. The central government\u2019s health ministry has a scheme to establish new medical colleges by upgrading district or referral hospitals. As part of this, it has been proposed to convert 75 district hospitals into medical colleges to boost availability of human resource for health sector. Maharashtra has proactively submitted proposals for seven district hospitals. When these hospitals become medical colleges, the directorate of medical education (DMER) will run them instead of directorate of health services (DHS). This is still a first step. It takes time to establish a medical college even if a general hospital has many basic facilities. According to a senior official of DMER, the state as well as the Centre were keen to increase MBBS and MD seats as it was necessary for the implementation of EWS reservation. \u201cThe in-principle approval is a major step. These seven new GMCs will be functional in next two years,\u201d the official claimed. At present, there are 41 medical colleges in State. They are affiliated to Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS). In Vidarbha, there are two GMCs in Nagpur, and one each in Chandrapur, Yavatmal, Akola, and Gondia.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

However, experts say even if the seeds are allowed, cotton farmers may not be able to use HT variety legally. Former director of Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) Keshav Kranthi said that this is because glyphosate-based herbicide are only recommended for use in teal plantations and barren land. Without being allowed to use glyphosate, HT seeds not be of any use to the cotton grower. Kranthi now heads the technical section of International Cotton Advisory Council in the US. In its comment to an earlier report carried by TOI, even Monsanto had said, \u201cIn India, glyphosate-based herbicides have been recommended for use in general weed control in non-cropped areas such as tea and pre-plant rice. It should be used only as per the recommended guidelines.\u201d Anil Ghanawat, President of Shetkari Sangathana, however said that glyphosate is non-selective herbicide and can also be used on the cotton crop. Shetkari Sangathana had started its campaign last week from Akoli Jahangir village of Akola district where farmer Lalit Bahale planted the seeds in front of police and 1,200 other farmers. If proven, this can lead to a five-year sentence. After that, farmers in districts like Wardha, Dhule and Ahmednagar have planted the seeds. This would be followed by farmers in Parbhani and Amravati. The declaration form prepared by the Sangathana will have details like farmers\u2019 name, village and the area in which the seed has been planted. Shetkari Sangathana has been pressing that the government should allow use of HT seeds. However, after the trials, Monsanto itself had withdrawn its application in 2016. On this, Ghanawat said it was due to the low royalty it would have got on the seeds. \u201cThe Sangathana demands that the government should not intervene in the prices and give the technology provider a free hand letting the market decide the price,\u201d he said.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. He defeated Congress's Ramnaraian Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently concluded general election. He has also been elected to Rajasthan assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. Birla will succeed eight-term MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this will not be for the first time a relative newcomer will hold the position. In 1996, TDP leader G M C Balayogi was also a two-time MP when he was elected as the LS Speaker and after his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and the first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

The huge saving of water in Pench reservoirs will not be possible as the water resources department (WRD) is all set to miss the deadline for completing Kochchhi barrage on Kanhan river by December-end. The NMC standing committee on Tuesday approved the water works department\u2019s proposal to appoint WAPCOS Limited, a central government company, to prepare Detailed Project Report (DPR) and also execute the project to use running water of Kanhan river instead of water from Pench reservoirs for six months, from June to December. The civic body will pay WAPCOS Rs21.99 crore for the project. NMC uses water from Pench reservoirs to supply drinking water to 70% areas of the city throughout the year. Requirement of remaining water is met from running water of Kanhan river. During summer, Kanhan river has to be fed from Pench reservoirs. Huge quantum of water goes waste from Kanhan river between June and December due to lack of a reservoir on it. Therefore, NMC planned to lay a pipeline from Kanhan river and use this running water instead of water from Pench reservoirs in these six months. The plan approved on Tuesday will take at least one year for WAPCOS Limited to prepare DPR and complete the project. The plan was prepared in June last year but was delayed due to reasons known only to NMC officials. Due to shortage of water in Pench reservoirs, WRD could not supply water for irrigation during both, kharip and rabbi, seasons. NMC is drawing water from dead stock of Pench reservoirs for last one month. The Pench reservoirs are likely to get less water this year too due to construction of Chaurai dam by Madhya Pradesh upstream of Pench river. Therefore, the delay in mitigation measures is likely to increase the water crisis next year. Ruling party leader Sandip Joshi admitted the inordinate delay from the water works department in completing the process. \u201cWe have decided to award the work to WAPCOS Limited without going for tendering process due to the delay. The project would have been delayed further in case of tendering,\u201d he said. Standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane said he would check about the delay and take appropriate action. In another setback, WRD officials confirmed water cannot be stored in Kochchhi barrage this monsoon. \u201cSome 80% of the works are completed. Project require another Rs300 crore for completion. We will be able to store water only in the next monsoon,\u201d they said. The barrage costing Rs947 crore is the first on Kanhan river. Around 75 million meter cube (MMC) water could have been stored in the barrage if it had been completed in time. The project was delayed due to shortage of funds.
