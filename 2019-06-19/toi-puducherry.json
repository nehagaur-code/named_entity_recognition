The doctors at the institute took his samples and sent them to the National Institute of Virology, Pune for testing for Nipah infection. The test results are likely to be declared on Wednesday or Thursday. The 75-year-old patient, identified as Ramalingam from a village near Kattumannarkoil in Cuddalore district visited Paravur near Ernakulam in Kerala where a man tested positive for Nipah virus. He was working there until he fell ill. He returned to his native village Melapoovizhindanallur in Cuddalore district a few days ago. He was admitted at a private hospital at Kattumannarkoil and was later referred to a government hospital. The duty doctors at the government hospital referred him to Jipmer on Monday night as his condition worsened. \u201cHis symptoms were not as bad as the first case (admitted a few days ago). He has a lung infection, high fever and cough He was conscious when he was admitted. We have taken his samples and sent them to NIV for testing. We are expecting the test results by tomorrow or the day after,\u201d said Jipmer medical superintendent A S Badhe. Meanwhile the Cuddalore district health authorities on learning about the suspected Nipah case dispatched a medical team to Melapoovizhindanallur village to screen all people who came in contact with the patient. Earlier, a 52-year-old patient identified as Natarajan also from Cuddalore, who went to Guruvayur in Kerala on work was admitted at Jipmer with symptoms akin to that of Nipah infection. Jipmer doctors sent his samples twice to National Institute of Virology, Pune for testing. He tested negative for Nipah infection on both occasions but tested positive for Japanese encephalitis. He succumbed to the infection despite medical attention. There is no specific treatment for Nipah infection. The patients will be given supportive treatment like ventilator support and administered IV fluids.

Of late, the government has not been settling the retirement benefits to its employees on time on superannuation. The government has not settled the gratuity and commutation value to the employees, who retired from service since November 2018. Similarly, the government has not settled the earned leave encashment to the employees who retired from service since May 2018. The government needs close to Rs 150 crore to clear all the dues to the retired employees. Bedi has been insisting the government accord top priority in extending retirement benefits to the employees on time. She has been urging the government to release all dues including the gratuity to the employees on the day of their retirement. She had earlier directed the secretary (finance) to initiate steps to authorize the department of accounts and treasuries to draw funds from other heads to settle the dues of the retired employees. \u201c\u2026I have seen many retired personnel suffer for timely release of pensions and other allowances/ entitlements. Take necessary steps to honour the commitments. Many have to go to courts or keep complaining and suffer. We must settle the bills,\u201d she said in a WhatsApp group post. Bedi has also directed the government headed by Narayanasamy to ensure that the public-sector undertakings (PSUs) and government-run societies that defaulted to contribute EPF and ESI to settle the dues immediately. \u201cReturn the provident funds of employees where ever diverted. Such diversion calls for criminal liabilities,\u201d she warned. She noted that several PSUs and societies have failed to complete the annual audit and submit the duly audited statements to the heads of the parent departments and the secretaries concerned. Some PSUs and societies have not submitted their annual audit statements for several years, she observed. She also insisted the government review the action taken by the PSUs and societies concerned on the audit reports of Comptroller and auditor general (CAG) of India, Union home ministry and others. She was of the strong opinion that the government will gain the confidence of the people if they implement these financial measures. \u201cIt is the duty of all concerned at the helm of responsibility to ensure these basics in the annual budget,\u201d she said.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option. We need to see how this will pan out.\" In Video:Bill seeking to lift green card cap amended to protect US workersDownload The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."}, "Bollywood actors who resorted to public transport": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/bollywood-actors-who-resorted-to-public-transport/photostory/65676673.cms", "description": ""}, "Police nab bike lifters, recover 3 stolen bikes worth Rs 4.5 lakh": {"time": "2019-06-07 14:00:00", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/police-nab-bike-lifters-recover-3-stolen-bikes-worth-rs-4-5-lakh/articleshow/69679944.cms", "description": "PUDUCHERRY: Police on Thursday arrested two motorcycle lifters and recovered three stolen motorcycles worth Rs 4.5 lakh from their possession.

In Vellore, one of the 24 drought-hit districts in Tamil Nadu, women have revived the seasonal Naganadhi river \u2014 the primary source of water for the region some decades ago \u2014 after it had been lifeless for 15 years. As a result, while much of the country has gone dry, people in many villages there have sufficient water to drink and irrigate their paddy fields. Miles away, in the hills of northern India, water conservation techniques are gaining momentum. Hundreds of villagers from Pauri Garhwal in Uttarakhand, egged on by children, are constructing reservoirs of various sizes. Many are signing conservation pledges to save rainwater this monsoon. These serve as an example of how India desperately needs larger engagement of local communities to protect water resources. In Vellore, it took up to 20,000 women four years to build 3,500 recharge wells and several boulder checks (using pebbles to slow down rainwater flow) to get Naganadhi to flow again in 2018. Through recharge wells, rainwater can be routed into shallow aquifers that enhance groundwater levels. \u201cA river flows above the surface only after the groundwater has been replenished. Therefore, reviving a river isn\u2019t just about its flow, but getting enough water to seep into the ground. In other words, letting rainwater infiltrate the soil by slowing it down. Once it rains this year, the river will be in spate,\u201d said Chandrasekaran Kuppan, director of Naganadhi Rejuvenation Project, an Art of Living Foundation (AOL) initiative. The programme is assisted by the Centre and was started in 2014. In the last decade, much of Vellore\u2019s agricultural labour migrated to the city as water bodies dried up, leaving nothing for irrigation. Most of those who left were men seeking contract work, leaving the womenfolk behind with little to do. But their lives changed when some AOL volunteers reached the district and suggested they revive the river. Such projects had already registered success in Karnataka, where Vedavathi and Kumudavathi rivers were brought back to life. A team was employed to mark the original trail of the river using satellite mapping and then an action plan was created based on the area\u2019s geology, geomorphology and land cover, catchment area and rainfall data. The river restoration project had government approval so women were registered as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) workers, which ensured them daily earnings. Nathiya, 32, among the first batch of women roped in for the project, said that agriculture again became feasible in her village of Salamanatham in Kaniyambadi block after they built 36 recharge wells. A recharge well about 20ft deep, 15ft long and 6ft wide takes at least 23 days and 10 workers to build. \u201cI can now grow water-intensive paddy in my land, something I could not have imagined a couple of years ago. I can grow crops as well and earn Rs 224 a day if I sign up as an MGNREGA worker,\u201d said Nathiya.

He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

The Walajapet police on Tuesday exhumed the boy\u2019s body which was buried on the Palar river bank on Friday night. After postmortem, the body was buried again.

While speculations were rife that the party would not retain Gaikwad owing to his differences with some senior BJP leaders, what came as a surprise was the ticket going to Sudhakar Shrungare, a member of the Latur zilla parishad. However, Shrungare, who is in the construction business, was the popular choice of local BJP workers. Gaikwad had won the 2014 election by a majority of over 2.5 lakh votes.

Several political parties, mostly traditional BJP opponents, have come together to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ensuing general elections beginning April 11. In a blog post, Jaitley said that over the last several months, India was \"exhausted\" with the talk of a 'Mahagathbandhan'. The rationale, he said, was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP were very strong and could not be challenged by individual party. Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

She directed the workers to apprise the voters that the 2019 Lok Sabha election was as important as the freedom movement. Infusing energy in them she said, \"Don't be afraid of anything as this is a weak government. Only a weak government curbs the voice of the people, which is a crime in democracy.\" Priyanka asked the workers to stand up for their leader whose only dream is the progress of India and its people. \"Rahul thinks of the people without any vested interest,\" Priyanka said citing the example of her conversation with Rahul on the issue of using self-help group women for campaigning. \"When I proposed to him this idea, he simply denied\u2026 saying that I created the SHGs to empower women, not use them in any way,\" Priyanka said quoting her brother. The Congress general secretary told the workers that she was working on mission 2022. \"We will, with your support, form the government in 2022.

Presently the male patient is on ventilator support at the isolation ward in the institute. He had been working in Guruvayur in Kerala where one person tested positive for Nipah infection. Meanwhile, the directorate of health and family welfare has made all necessary arrangements to prevent any outbreak of Nipah infection in the Union territory. It has deployed teams of (Indian Red Cross Society IRCS) volunteers at bus stands and railway stations to identify sick travellers from high-risk areas of Kerala viz., Thrissur, Kollam, Ernakulam and Idukki districts and admit them to the isolation facility at the government hospital for chest diseases (GHCD) where a dedicated team from Indira Gandhi medical college and research institute (IGMC & RI) will screen the patients for Nipah virus. The team will refer patients requiring intensive intervention to Jipmer, which will extend diagnostic support for lab confirmation of suspected cases with Nipah infection including logistic support to transport samples to NIP and receiving the test results. The IRCS volunteers have been advising homecare under isolation for sick travellers, who are not suspected of Nipah infection. The directorate also instructed all the private medical colleges to equip themselves with necessary facilities including isolation wards with beds exclusively to treat patients suspected with Nipah infection. It has identified the head of the department of medicine of the Indira Gandhi government general hospital and postgraduate institute as the nodal officer for Nipah. It has directed both government and private tertiary care hospitals to send daily notification of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases to the integrated disease surveillance project (IDSP).

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

He recalled that the government could implement the free rice scheme and other projects only after a six-day sit-in strike led by him, his cabinet leaders and leaders of its allies in front Raj Nivas in February this year. He went on to claim that the landslide victory of Congress\u2019 candidate V Vaithilingam in the Lok Sabha polls reflected the people\u2019s rejection of Bedi's interference in the day-to-day affairs of the elected government. \u201cAnd still lieutenant governor has not changed her approach,\u201d Narayanasamy said. Stating that the elected government derives the strength from the leaders and cadres of Congress party and its allies, he said the government has been compelled to take an alternative course of action if Bedi continues to stall the projects introduced by the government. He was of the strong opinion that a lieutenant government must assist the government in securing more funds for the Union territory from the Centre and act in coordination with the government. \u201cLieutenant governor must not undertake inspections and convene meetings with the territorial officials to review various schemes,\u201d he claimed. The Madras high court on April 30 declared that the Puducherry lieutenant governor cannot run a parallel government and cannot interfere with the day-to-day affairs of the elected government. The Union government filed an appeal before the Supreme Court against the Madras high court order. A vacation bench of the Supreme Court comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and M R Shah directed the Puducherry government not to implement any decisions having financial implications until June 21. The Puducherry cabinet, which will convene on June 7, has proposed to accord approval to a slew of projects that were rejected by the Union home ministry. Most of the projects have been proposed in Yanam, the territory\u2019s enclave in Andhra Pradesh.

He was 78. He breathed his last at 2.30am at Pondicherry institute of medical sciences (Pims) where he was undergoing treatment. Janakiraman was admitted at Pims at 3am on June 2. He was bed-ridden for a prolonged period due to parkinsonism, seizure disorder and chronic kidney disease. His condition deteriorated at 12.30am on June 10 after he had profound hypotension. He passed away at 2.30am on the same day. Janakiraman\u2019s body was kept at his residence on Gingee Salai for the public to pay homage until 7pm on Monday. The last rites will be held in his native village -- Alathur -- in Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu at 10am on Tuesday. DMK president M K Stalin, PMK founder-leader S Ramadoss, Puducherry lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi, chief minister V Narayanasamy and a host of Congress and DMK leaders condoled the death of Janakiraman. Narayanasamy said the late chief minister would be laid to rest with full state honours. The government will extend a state funeral to the departed leader.  The Puducherry government will observe state mourning for three days from June 10 as a mark of respect to the departed soul. There shall be no official entertainment during the period of state mourning and the national flag will be flown at half-mast for three days from June 10 through the Union territory of Puducherry. Stalin in his condolence message said late DMK leader M Karunanidhi honoured Janakiramnan with \u2018Anna Award\u2019 as early as in 2005. He said Janakiraman remained loyal to Karunanidhi and the party until his last breath and strived hard to develop the party in the Union territory. Ramadoss while condoling the death of the DMK leader recalled how Janikaraman despite hailing from a simple background worked hard to raise high in the political ladder and became the Puducherry chief minister. Bedi said Puducherry lost one of its veteran political leaders with the passing away of Janakiraman. \"As chief minister of Puducherry and DMK party veteran leader, he was known for its astuteness in politics and administration. My deep condolences to the grieved family members and its followers,\" she said in the message. Janakiraman\u2019 had served as Puducherry chief minister between 1996 and 2000. He was elected from Nellithope constituency for five consecutive terms (1985, 1990, 1991, 1996 and 2001). He lost to AIADMK candidate Om Sakthi Sekar in 2006 and 2011 assembly polls. After being diagnosed with parkinsonism, seizure disorder and chronic kidney disease, Janakiraman had not been active in the political sphere for the past few years.

Blue flag certification is accorded by the Denmark-based Foundation for Environment Education (FEE) to the beaches that fulfil 33 stringent criteria for reducing existing pollution, managing solid waste and marine litter, adopting eco-friendly measures, improving seawater quality for bathing, enhancing safety and security measures and promoting tourism and allied initiatives among others. Once the beaches receive blue flag certification, FEE will mention them in its global headquarters. The tourists, who are familiar with blue flag certification and its standards, will plan their holidays in those countries. The ministry\u2019s body \u2013 Society of integrated coastal management (Sicom) \u2013 in coordination with FEE launched a pilot coastal management project (Beams \u2013 Beach environment and aesthetics management services) to select beaches that can meet the requirements for blue flag certification in the country. The society after undertaking extensive fieldwork has selected 13 beaches including one in Puducherry (Eden in Chinna Veerampattinam) for the globally-applauded blue flag beach certification. The ministry launched a series of campaigns to realize the goal of attaining the eco-label for the selected beaches in the country. The campaign in Puducherry was formally launched during the world environment day celebrations on Wednesday. The initiatives include massive cleaning of the beach with eco-friendly tools and equipment, segregating and recycling of garbage and imparting environment education to members of the local communities, fishermen societies and school children. A team from the National centre for sustainable coastal management visited Puducherry a week ago and took seawater samples for checking the quality. The team also did a bathymetric survey to analyse under-seawater features and wave current and intensity. If the survey results meet the blue flag criterion, the ministry will earmark 500m-800m stretch of the beach and will establish an effective solid waste management system, watch tower with experienced lifeguards to save people from drowning, bathing facilities at international standards besides providing clean drinking water through a reverse osmosis plant and installing solar power generating units. The country has proposed to secure certification for 10 beaches in 2019-20. Shivrajpur (Dwarka in Gujarat) and Ghoghia (Daman & Diu) are ready for certification this season while four other beaches will be ready for certification by the next season. \"The target is to develop at least 50 to 100 blue flag beaches in India in the next five years,\" said Sicom mission leader Sanjai Jalla.

In a letter to the Prime Minister, the former MP said most of members of the fishing community remain backward and poor leading a hand-to-mouth existence. He said 69% of the 15 million fishermen in the country live below the poverty line and dwell in unsanitary conditions without basic amenities. The community is affected every year by storms or droughts or incessant rain. They remain at the lowest rung of the social ladder. He said their level of literacy remains low and social and economic status lower than that of SCs and STs in many parts of the country. Their political representation in the parliament and assemblies remain low. He pointed out that the Mandal Commission suggested reserving constituencies for fishermen community and accord tribal status to them. He said the marine production of the country is 25% less than its potential. The marine production potential was pegged at 3.92 million tonnes whereas the actual output stood at 2.92 million tonnes. \u201cLack of infrastructure, inability to venture into deep sea fishing, high cost of fishing, intermittent natural hazards, environmental degradation including pollution and a host of other factors account for such a situation,\u201d he said. He argued that 15 million fishermen dwelling in 3,288 marine fishing villages in nine maritime states and four Union territories and several other villages of inland waterways contribute a great deal to the socio-economic development of India. Their toil elevated India as the second largest producer of fish in the world. The total fish production in 2017-18 was estimated at 12.6 million tonnes, which is 6.3% of the global fish production. The sector exports 13.77 tonnes of 50 different fish varieties to 75 countries fetching a foreign exchange revenue of Rs 45,107 crore and provides employment to over 11 million people, he said. The long-deprived community and its occupation require special treatment like the SCs and STs, which can be accomplished only by an exclusive ministry, he said.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer. SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha said a special campaign is being run against criminals involved in gambling and betting ahead of elections. \u201cThese criminals are made to sign bonds to prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. Raids are being conducted on specific tips. A list of habitual offenders is being prepared by police stations to curb such illegal activities,\u201d he said. ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs. For instance, we were tipped off on Monday night about a betting den in Kolar. It was raided but no such activity was found,\u201d Mishra said, adding that the cyber cell is constantly on the lookout for websites and mobile apps used by betting rackets.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. He defeated Congress's Ramnaraian Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently concluded general election. He has also been elected to Rajasthan assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013. Birla will succeed eight-term MP Sumitra Mahajan as the Speaker, a post traditionally held by senior MPs. However, this will not be for the first time a relative newcomer will hold the position. In 1996, TDP leader G M C Balayogi was also a two-time MP when he was elected as the LS Speaker and after his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and the first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh. Without elaborating, Modi mocked that Pakistan has now accepted Naidu's \"friends\" as \"hero.\" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."}, "Shiv Sena List 2019": {"time": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/shiv-sena-announces-21-lok-sabha-candidates-for-maharashtra/articleshow/68523309.cms", "description": "MUMBAI: Shiv Sena has come up with it's first list of 21 candidates, out of 23 to contest in Lok Sabha polls in Maharashtra.
