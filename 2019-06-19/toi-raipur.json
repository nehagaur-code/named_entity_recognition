Her desire to study in a reputed school outside the high prison walls finally became a reality on Wednesday.

He was very moved to see her all by herself and started a conversation. At first, she was a bit hesitant to speak and the caretaker said that her father is a prisoner she is staying with women inmates here. The mother of the minor girl - Khushi (name changed), died of jaundice when she was just 15-day-old. Her father took care of her, but when she was one-year-old, he was convicted for a crime and was sentenced to 10 years in jail. With no one to look after her, the little girl was forced to live in the jail. Incidentally, her father has already served five years in jail. When the collector spoke to her and asked about her studies, Khushi said that she is studying in a playschool inside the jail premises. When asked if she wants to go outside for studies, she expressed her desire to study in a reputed school and become a successful person and do something big in her life. \"I always want to go outside these tall prison walls and play with kids of my age and study in a reputed school like other children,\" she said. \"Mera yaha man nahi lagta,\" Khushi said, with a sad expression on her face. After hearing her words, the collector became extremely emotional and promised her that he will get her admitted in one of the best schools of the city and she will no longer have to live inside the prison. The collector immediately spoke to various school authorities in the city and Jain International School agreed to give Khushi admission. The Lions Club also came forward to provide financial assistance to the little girl. Her elated father also agreed to the arrangement. The collector has instructed the jail authorities, women and child development (WCD) department and education department officials to complete all formalities in order to secure her admission. The admission in-charge of Jain International School contacted the jail administration and started the process of admitting Khushi to Class 1. The happy-go-lucky little girl will attend classes from June 17, when the school reopens after the summer vacation. Khushi will stay in the school hostel and a caretaker will also be arranged for her by the school authorities. The collector has urged citizens to come forward and help children like Khushi to fulfil their dreams. \"Children are bound to stay in jails due to their incarcerated parents. The future of these children can be secured if citizens and social institutions come forward to help them to grow and fulfil their dreams,\" he said.

The annual interest on her FD was calculated at Rs25,797 and the bank, after deducting TDS of Rs5160 from the interest, deposited it with the Income Tax (I-T) department.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: ReportHowever, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. \"Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,\" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently,   H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify   that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. \"We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,\" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: \"Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option.

Not budging in the face of Joshi\u2019s stiff resistance to being asked to step aside, BJP announced Satyadev Pachauri, a minister in the UP cabinet, as the replacement for the octogenarian leader. The list of 30 candidates for UP, however, accommodated women and child welfare minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi, who were allowed to swap their Pilibhit and Sultanpur seats. Other interesting picks include   actor-politician Jaya Prada   , who was named against SP leader Azam Khan from Rampur in UP soon after she joined BJP. The selection ignites an old and bitter rivalry, as the former Bollywood star is close to former SP leader Amar Singh who has scores to settle with SP and Khan. Another UP cabinet minister, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former UP Congress chief who joined BJP, will contest from the prestigious constituency of Allahabad, where the sitting party MP, Shyama Charab Gupta, has left for SP and is contesting from Banda. She is the daughter of the late H N Bahuguna, a former UP chief minister and well-known Congress leader. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party\u2019s candidate from Patna Sahib, faced protests when he landed in Patna on Tuesday. The protesters claimed loyalty to BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was later pulled up by the party while sources said the heckling was led by a person identified as an expelled BJP member. Varun Gandhi, who has had his ups and downs in BJP, was on the list of nominees and will stake his claim for Pilibhit, which has been a family bastion. Maneka Gandhi will be pitted in a triangular contest against SP-BSP alliance candidate Chandrabhanu Singh, alias Sonu Singh, a local politician with clout among Rajput voters who could have turned up the heat for Varun. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is in the fray as the Congress nominee. Joshi, a former BJP president, made no secret of his displeasure at being denied a ticket and went public by releasing a letter addressed to voters of Kanpur saying he received a call from party general secretary (organisation) Ramlal asking him not to contest the polls. Joshi, 85, has been asked not to contest just as it was decided that 91-year-old party patriarch L K Advani will not fight from Gandhinagar. Joshi\u2019s defiant note was possibly the reason behind the nomination of a Brahmin face as another UP state minister, Satish Mahana, had been talked of as the frontrunner to replace the veteran leader The party decision is in line with several veterans not being nominated to pave way for younger leaders. The 2019 election will see the curtain drop on the electoral politics of what was seen the Vajpayee-Advani era in the party. BJP has also not given tickets to B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty \u2014 all MPs for several terms and over 80 years of age. BJP sprang a surprise by giving 28-year-old Tejaswi Surya, an advocate and Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary, the ticket from Bangalore South, belying expectations that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar would be its choice for the constituency her husband represented six times. The choice triggered strong protests and even state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa said they had sent only Tejaswini\u2019s name, which, he claimed, was changed in Delhi. Tejaswini had to issue statements to mollify her supporters as she said the polls were about re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. BJP has announced 349 candidates, including 62 in UP, so far. Two seats in UP have been left for alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal). Party president Amit Shah will decide the remaining 16 seats in UP where sitting MPs are likely to be replaced, and a reason behind delaying the announcement is to reduce prospects of dissidence and rebellion. The party has so far dropped 14 sitting MPs in UP. BJP general secretary Arun Singh announced that Union minister Manoj Sinha has been fielded from Ghazipur, a seat he had won in 2014. BJP\u2019s Kisan Morcha chief Birendra Singh Mast has been shifted from his sitting seat Bhadohi to far-east Ballia in UP, replacing sitting MP Bharat Singh, whose poor performance was a concern for the party. Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria, head of the SC commission who had been denied renomination from the current seat, has been moved to Etawah (SC), replacing Ashok Kumar Dohray.

If at all, Raman Singh knew that there were urban Naxals infiltrating the system, why didn\u2019t he take action during 15 years of his rule in state?\u201d he said reacting to state BJP executive\u2019s political resolution passed on Sunday. \u201cWhy did Raman Singh government fail to investigate the case of former Rajnandgaon SP VK Choubey, who exposed the urban Maoists network and was later killed in Maoist attack? Nearly 29 jawans were killed in the incident. This can only be Raman\u2019s style of functioning in dealing with such cases, not of the Congress,\u201d Baghel added. BJP state executive, who met here on Sunday, adopted a political resolution criticising the Bhupesh Baghel government alleging that an atmosphere of anarchy and insecurity is prevailing in the state. \u201cBJP\u2019s lone legislator from Bastar Bhima Mandavi was killed in a Maoist attack,\u201d the resolution said.

What an irony it is that the former chief minister Raman Singh\u2019s region Rajnandgaon is included in the list of \u2018aspirational districts\u2019,\u201d Baghel said. The BJP on Sunday claimed that an emergency like situation is prevailing in the state and people fear the government.

The government will also probe allegations that that gram sabha decision was \u201cfaked\u201d to show village council\u2019s consent for industrial activity in the tribal region. Adani Group has said that Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) will initiate any activity \u201conly after all mandatory requirements are met\u201d by the owners NMDC CMDC Limited (NCL), and that AEL was not involved in obtaining clearances. Thousands of tribals began their agitation in front of the NMDC office in Kirandul on June 7. They had trooped from all over the region, bundles of ration perched on their head, prepared for long haul to save Nandiram Hill \u2014 which they consider sacred \u2014 from mining activities. The government\u2019s decision to suspend activities in Bailadila came after Congress MP from Bastar, Deepak Baij, former Union minister Arvind Netam and a delegation of agitating tribals called on chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and apprised him about the sentiments of the locals. The protesters told chief minister Baghel that gram sabha's approval is mandatory under Panchayat Extension in Scheduled Area's Act 1996 (PESA) for processes such as transfer of mine. But the decision was faked in 2014, they allege. A government spokesman said CM Baghel has issued directions to put \"all ongoing activities on hold for the time being, stop cutting of trees and conduct a probe into the complaint that gram sabha decision was faked in 2014 \".

Since the mine belongs to central public sector undertaking NMDC, it\u2019s for them to take the necessary decisions. Hence, we are writing to the Centre to inform it of the situation and sentiments of the people,\u201d Baghel told the delegation. Thousands of tribals, carrying bows and arrows, have been on agitation for the past five days in scorching 45-degree heat. Many of them fell ill and were hospitalized, but the agitation didn\u2019t falter. Under the banner of Gramin Panchayat Sangh Samiti, tribals have vowed to protect \u2018jal-jangal-jameen\u2019 and their sacred hill. Maoists of Darbha division have extended support to the agitation, opposing \u201chanding over Bastar\u2019s natural resource to corporate houses.\u201d Janata Congress founder and former CM Ajit Jogi, who joined the agitation on Saturday, wrote to Congress president Rahul Gandhi late Monday night, urging him to impress upon his party\u2019s government to withdraw the \u201cconsent to establish\u201d certificate granted by the state environment board. On February 12 this year, the state government gave Adani Enterprises the consent to establish certificate for mining operations to extract 2 million tonnes iron ore per annum from Deposit No. 13 (where Nandiram Hill lies), he has said. Reacting to the development, an Adani Group spokesman said: \u201cAs of today, Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) does not have any presence in Kirandul for mining. AEL has not commenced its project yet and will initiate any activity only after all mandatory requirements are met by the owner, NMDC CMDC Limited (NCL). NCL owns the iron ore resources and AEL will provide support only as an experienced and responsible mining contractor. AEL was not involved in obtaining clearances for the project.\u201d NMDC and NMDC formed a joint venture in 2008. In 2017, mining lease was transferred to the government-owned joint venture company NMDC-CMDC Ltd (NCL). In January 2018, at least 10 companies expressed interest to participate in the international competitive bid for Bailadila iron ore deposit No. 13, and AEL was selected through transparent reverse bidding.

Canvassing for RJD candidate Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal from Bhagalpur, Tejashwi came down heavily on NDA governments at the Centre and in state. He accused PM Narendra Modi of making false promises and propaganda to win the 2014 general election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections,\u201d Tejashwi said while raising questions about employment scenario and issues of Vijay Malaya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Chowksi and others who fled the country after swindling money from banks in India. Criticizing Nitish for snapping ties with RJD in 2017, Tejashwi said there was acute shortage of fertilizers, while the health services were also in a poor state. He accused deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting those involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur and some other districts. Urging the audience to vote for the RJD candidate, Tejashwi said the Bhagalpur voters had showed a mirror to Modi by voting for RJD in 2014. \u201cThey should do the same this election as the NDA government stands exposed,\u201d he said. Political observers feel Tejashwi has become a good orator, especially after coming out of power in July 2017 when CM Nitish Kumar snapped ties with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and rejoined BJP-led NDA. \u201cThough not as good as his father in terms of having a rustic touch, Tejashwi is a good orator in terms of eloquence,\u201d said DM Diwakar, political observer and professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

The band, called Rhythm Queens, had last performed 14 years ago and since been defunct owing to the several hurdles that came its way. Taking a big leap, the enthusiastic group came forward recently and pleased city\u2019s music lovers with their melodies.  Talking about the uniqueness of the city that encouraged the girls to be involved in the music compositions, Som Dutt Panda, the band\u2019s secretary, said, \u201cThis could happen only in Raipur because of the city\u2019s loving and encouraging nature. The shows have been a hit and we\u2019ll continue with a soaring spirit. The compositions and performances were applauded both in the state and elsewhere.\u201d  The orchestra members include Sivani, Udita and Sana on the keyboard, Lavanya on the guitar base, Gyani and Jhanvi on the drums, Bhagyashree with a flute, Poonam on tabla and Aditi Nigham on the drum pad among others. When the band first performed in 2001, the show received good reviews. However, the girls discontinued due to a lot of reasons. The team again reunited this year, in September.  They kicked off the performances with a 10-day audition round for musicians and finally performed after practicing for a month.  The desire to do something new, kept them moving. Speaking about the band\u2019s x-factor, its joint secretary, Shambhu Deep, said, \u201cA few young girls were hand-picked and trained. What\u2019s special is that though they were trained just for a few months, they produce music like professionals. Also, people find it very exciting that it is an all-girls band. The compositions are novel and beautiful and will soon be uploaded online.\u201d Their passion for music keeps the girls together who jam daily for almost 3-4 hours and have been busy practicing for music concerts.

You were a surprise choice for Bengaluru South. Did you expect this development?While I had feelers that there was something like this going around, I was quite happily savouring pani puri with my friends. To be honest I was overwhelmed and started tweeting about this. I only feel gratitude towards the party, which is facing a crucial election and has decided to take risk by fielding a youngster in such a prestigious seat. At 28, will you be able to fill the shoes of Kumar?Filling the shoes of Ananth Kumar is a far fetched thing for he was so gigantic. I only pray to God to give me strength, sincerity and earnestness to honestly work for the people of this constituency so that one day in the eyes of the people I can match up to Kumar\u2019s contribution to the constituency. On lack of political experience, I have a well oiled party organisational machinery to support me with senior leaders there to hand hold me. So what is this election going to be for you?Primarily it is an election for PM Narendra Modi\u2019s aspirational India. It is about the promise of a new and young India and I am just an ambassador of the message of this new India. It is a reflection of party and Modi\u2019s inclination of bringing in young blood. Tejaswini not getting the ticket is quite sensitive...Yes it is sensitive but even during her talk with the Karyakartas she told them that the it was time to show maturity. She has given her full support to me. But what is your personal opinion about Tejaswini missing the ticket?When her name was first finalised by the state leadership, it must be March 11, I was the first to extend my support to her and remember posting on social media that she was the most deserving candidate and a good choice from the constituency. But the party decided to field an ordinary karyakarta like me. It is a decision taken by big people and I am just a foot soldier obeying their diktat. I have always supported Tejaswini ma\u2019am and was literally groomed by that family. I have no reason for acrimony. Statements by Karti Chidamabaram suggest that you are the Schutzstaffel of BJP, or the infamous SS of the Nazi Germany... Your tweets also suggest that your idealogical beliefs are in conflict with the \u201cSab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas\u201d For Karti Chidambaram and others I will reply back to them in their own coin. The idealogical inclinations are not an issue for this election. The issue for the election today, is PM Modi\u2019s promise of a new and superpower India. My only concern as on today is to ensure that Bangalore South elects the BJP with a massive margin so that we will strengthen Modi hands. Rest is immaterial. Is age an advantage or do you require time to project yourself as a leader?That the party leadership has reposed faith in me speaks for itself and the least minimum I can do is to live up to it and say I am capable enough as on today to take on these challenges. You must rise to the occasion and I will rise to it. On dynasty politics, considering you are a nephew of a sitting BJP MLA and PM Modi has gone on the offensive against the Congress on the issue of \u201cNaamdar\u201d...My candidature and my role and activity in politics has no connection to my uncle\u2019s political life. I have an identity of my own and have worked very hard over years. My aspirations precedes his elections.

If the maverick BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh hit the headlines for his remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma hit a new low by making indecent comments on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The Bairia MLA had said Mayawati gets facials done and her hair coloured even though she is 60-years-old. He also reportedly made offensive remarks against UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary, evoking widespread criticism from political parties and social media users. A media agency quoted him as saying that both Sonia Gandhi and Sapna Chaudhary used to work as dancers. \"Rahul's mother (Sonia Gandhi) was also in the same profession in Italy and his father made her his own. He (Rahul Gandhi) should also take the family tradition forward and make Sapna his own,\" the MLA said. The BJP legislator, who is known for his controversial statements, had earlier termed Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra \"Ravana and Shurpanakha\", and accused Mayawati of \"murdering\" a woman's dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party. UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma stirred up a hornet's nest with his tweet terming the Congress president a \"coward and impotent\". The comments triggered a war of words between the two parties as well as on social media platform. Firebrand Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also finds mention in the list of leaders accused of making personal remarks against political rivals. He recently termed Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, the son-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Azhar Masood. Addressing a rally in Saharanpur on Sunday, Adityanath said, \"The son-in-law of Azhar Masood has entered the constituency and he speaks the language of the terror mastermind. \"You people have to ensure that the person who speaks the language of Azhar Masood is defeated in the Lok Sabha elections,\" he said while seeking votes for BJP candidate from Saharanpur, Raghav Lakhanpal. Union minister and BJP MP Mahesh Sharma referred to Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'Pappu ki Pappi' during a poll campaign in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Rahul Gandhi has often been mocked by the BJP and his opposition as 'Pappu', a colloquial sneer. \"Pappu kehta hai main prime minister banunga Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Pappu.. aur ab 'Pappu ki Pappi' bhi aa gayi hai. Wo Priyanka kya pehle hamare desh ki beti nahi thi kya, Congress ki beti nahi thi kya, aage nahi rahegi kya? kya naya leke aayi hai?\" the minister told a crowd of his supporters on March 16.

However, the police dropped the charges on Friday after chief minister Bhupesh Baghel went public expressing his displeasure for slapping IPC section 124A and vouching that he was all for protecting freedom of expression. The arrest of accused Mangilal Agrawal, who hails from Rajnandgaon, comes at a time when the Congress in its election manifesto to review and amend the law including the contentious IPC section 124A that deals with sedition. Mangilal Agrawal had posted a video on social media platforms strongly criticising the Congress government for frequent interruptions in power supply in Chhattisgarh, which is known as a power surplus state, during this summer. His social media post claimed that interruptions in power supply were deliberate to benefit inverter companies to boost their sales and the power cut is just a ploy to mint money. On the complaint of state power holding company officials, police swung into action late on Thursday and picked him up and slapped charges under 124A for sedition, 505 for statements conducing to public mischief, rumours with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquillity. State power holding company chairman Shailendra Shukla forwarded this video to company legal advisor NKP Singh, who advised that legal action for spreading rumours to tarnish the image of chief minister and power company chairman and to cause alarm to the public that could adversely affect public tranquillity. Later, an FIR was lodged against the accused. However, Power companies chairman Shailendra Shukla told media that power supply is affected due to various factors, including natural causes like strong winds. But some people are spreading false information that these were caused due to some deal with inverter companies which is totally fake. The arrest sparked an outrage on the social media and BJP MP from Rajnandgaon Santosh pandey said while the Congress had promised to repeal the sedition law, the government itself is misusing it to implicate and threaten the common masses. If spreading rumours is such an offence, so far several Congressmen should have been put behind bars, he said. Stung by criticism, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel issued a statement disapproving the police action and asked the Director General of police DM Awasthy to have review and re-investigate the matter. Within hours, police dropped the sedition charges against Mangilal Agrawal against whom the charges of IPC section 505 would remain. Later, Baghel issued a statement saying that he and his government vouched for people\u2019s freedom of expression. \u201cSuch actions were followed as a tradition by the previous BJP governments. We are always for freedom of expression\u201d, he said and appealed to the people to exercise restraint in their expressions. \u201cI have directed those concerned to withdraw seditions charges immediately and to ensure that such actions are not repeated in future\u201d, he said. Earlier, regional party Janata Congress president Amit Jogi took to Twitter and Facebook to share the video, posted by Mangilal Agrawal, saying that he had posted the video on social media. \u201cI am available at my residence in Raipur.

The actress, who started off as a Telugu film heroine dominating the scene along with Sridevi some decades ago, changed her political course on Tuesday by joining the BJP. In the last 25 years of her political career, she has changed several parties. Hailing from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, she began her political career with the Telugu Desam Party in 1994 as she had done several films alongside TDP founderpresident N T Rama Rao. After N Chandrababu Naidu took over as chief minister, he nominated her to the Rajya Sabha and she served a term from 1996-2002. While in the TDP, Jaya Prada had a running feud with Renuka Chowdhary who was also in the TDP then. When it became clear that she was being ignored in the TDP, Jaya Prada looked for greener pastures elsewhere. The Samajwadi Party led by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh got Jaya Prada into its party fold. She contested the Rampur Lok Sabha seat from that state on the SP ticket and won in 2004. In the 2009 elections, she got re-elected from the same constituency. With differences sprouting between SP leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Jaya prada had to make a choice on who she would sail with. She preferred to join the new party that Amar Singh floated but that proved to be a futile exercise. Jaya Prada then joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal, led by Ajit Singh in UP, making the move along with Amar Singh. In the 2014 elections she was fielded as an LS candidate from Bijnor but lost. For some time, there was speculation that Jaya Prada would return to the Telugu Desam Party when she met Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati in November 2015. It turned out that she had met Naidu only to invite him for her son Siddharth\u2019s wedding that month in Hyderabad. In 2013, Jaya Prada had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that also led to speculation that she would join the Congress. She had even announced that she was interested in getting back to her home state and would continue her political career there. She was keen on returning to AP politics but nothing concrete materialised. On Tuesday, she was welcomed into the BJP at the party\u2019s headquarters in Delhi. \u201cI am working with a brave leader in whose hands India is safe,\u201d she said about Modi.

Stressing that Indians judge politicians by their merit and capacity and no longer by any traditional loyalty, he said: \"We were promised a 'coalition of rivals' because India had to be saved. We were promised a common minimum agenda. Each leader amongst the aspirant Prime Ministers wanted to become a 'sutradhar' (anchor) of the alliance. He/she would periodically organise shows in his/her State and invite the entire bandwagon.\" In opposition camp, Jaitley said there is a tussle for leadership as already multiple candidates have made their desire clear to take over the mantle of the leadership. According to him, each one of them is interested to see the strength of the other party's contender depleting and also have high hopes in a chaotic and highly hung Parliament. \"He/ she believes that only in a chaotic situation he/she has a chance,\" said Jaitley, who is heading the BJP's publicity division of the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections. The past track record of such governments in terms of policy, longevity and growth has to be borne in mind, he said adding their track record of corruption is equally well-known. Jaitley further said it is only because of the size of the BJP and clarity on leadership in the last coalition that a successful government was run under Prime Minister Modi. \"Today you have no 'gathbandhan' let alone 'mahagathbandhan'. It is a 'non-bandhan'. You have no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds. \"Stability, which is paramount, is a major casualty. The only thing in common is negative agenda 'remove one man'. It is a recipe for chaos,\" he said in the blog titled 'A Political Circus Called 'Mahagathbandhan'. The nominations for the first two phases of polling are over and those for the third phase are about to happen. The results will be announced on May 23.

It will be a keenly fought battle between Tamilisai and DMK\u2019s state women wing secretary and Rajya Sabha MP K Kanimozhi in Tuticorin. Though Tamilisai initially preferred to contest from Chennai South, which has a sizeable votebank for the party, she finally settled for Tuticorin.

It triggered a storm of criticism, and the charge was revoked on Friday on the orders of chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who told police to ensure that it isn't repeated.  The controversy began with a Rajnandgaon resident, Mangilal Agrawal, posting a video of his on various social media platforms on Wednesday, criticising the Congress government for frequent interruptions in power supply in Chhattisgarh. He alleged that the power cuts were deliberate, as a ploy to boost inverter sales .  The video went viral. State power holding company chairman Shailendra Shukla forwarded it to company legal advisor N K P Singh, who advised legal action. An FIR was filed and Agrawal was arrested on Thursday. He was charged under IPC 124A for sedition and IPC 505 (intent to incite any class or community to commit offence against any other class or community). Both of them are non-bailable . What made the arrest even more controversial was that ahead of Lok Sabha election, Congress had sought votes on its pledge to abolish the British-era law.  The arrest sparked outrage on social media. \"Congress had promised to repeal the sedition law, yet its government is misusing it. If spreading rumours is such a serious offence, then several Congressmen should have been put behind bars by now,\" said BJP MP from Rajnandgaon, Santosh Pandey.  Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel issued a statement, disapproving of the police action. Within hours, police dropped the sedition charge. Baghel said he and his government \"vouch for freedom of expression\".  However, Agrawal is still in custody as he faces charges under IPC 505. \"Power supply is affected due to various factors, including natural causes like strong winds. But some people are spreading false information that it's due to some kind of a 'deal' with inverter companies. This is totally false,\" said power companies' chairman Shailendra Shukla.

Thousands of tribals are camping out in Kirandul, determined to protect 'jal-jangal-jameen', handing the six-month-old Congress government its biggest challenge yet. At the heart of the protest is Nandaraj Hill, which is marked as Bailadila iron ore deposit No. 13. In September last year, Adani Enterprises incorporated Bailadila Iron Ore Mining Private Ltd as a special purpose vehicle, and successfully bid for mine developer-cum-operator (MOO) for the Bailadila deposit. But villagers rose in protest against deposit No. 13 being given to the private firm, alleging it will bring about \"destruction and deforestation\" in the 315.8-hectare forest patch. Moreover, tribal villagers say, they have a strong religious connection with Nandaraj Hill, where they regularly go to pray. The Adani Group has issued a statement that it believes in 'growth with goodness', but the protesters refuse to budge. They gheraoed the National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) office on Friday, alleging that thousands of trees are already being felled. To make things more difficult for the administration, Maoists of Darbha division have thrown their weight behind the agitation. The rebels have distributed leaflets to support the tribals. Protestors threaten to block highways, railway tracksUnder the banner of \u2018Gramin Panchayat Sangh Samiti\u2019, tribals have started gathering in the thousands in Kirandul. Many of them have travelled all the way from Sukma. People from Hiroli, Benpal, Mudadi, Guniyapal have gathered in large numbers and were seen cooking food on Friday.  Police said they have not taken action so far as it\u2019s a peaceful protest. Security is being tightened even further as police suspect Maoists are egging on the agitation. The protesters have warned that they will begin blocking trains and national highways if mining isn\u2019t stopped. JCC, AAP and CPI leaders are supporting the protesters. Tribal leader Soni Sori and Ajit Jogi might join the protest, say sources. In a statement issued by Adani Group, a company spokesman said, \u201cLocated in South Bastar in Dantewada, Bailadila Iron Ore Deposits (natural resources) are owned by government. It is important to note that central and stateowned NCL owns these mines and Adani Enterprises Ltd only provides the support as an experienced and responsible mining contractor.\u201d  \u201cAdani Group strongly believes in \u2018Growth with Goodness\u2019 and this is evident from the community-oriented initiatives undertaken by its notfor-profit arm, Adani Foundation,\u201d it said. NMDC and state PSU, Chhattisgarh Mineral Development Corporation Ltd (CMDC Ltd), formed a joint venture in 2008 to commence mining, it pointed out, adding that NMDC conducted gram sabhas between 2010 and 2014, got environment clearance in 2015 and forest clearance in January 2017. In 2017, mining lease was transferred to the government-owned joint venture company, NMDC-CMDC Ltd (NCL), the Adani Group statement goes. \u201cIn January 2018, at least 10 companies expressed interest in the international competitive bid for development and operation of Bailadila iron ore deposit No. 13. AEL was selected as successful bidder through transparent reverse bidding. In December 2018, NCL appointed AEL as mining contractor. AEL was not involved in obtaining clearances for the project and only after December 2018 it assumed role of mining contractor through transparent bidding,\u201d it said.

This Ramzan, quite a few families in Raipur turned sehri into an opportunity for get-togethers with family and close friends.

The Bhopal satta bazaar that gave BJP a good chance three weeks ago is suddenly abuzz about Congress\u2019 prospects. As per the bookies, till about a month ago, if a person placed a bet of Rs 10,000 on BJP, he would get Rs 11,000 if the party returned to power. And anyone who bet Rs 4,400 on Congress would get Rs 10,000 if the opposition wins. This week, bookies say, they are taking bets on number of seats and not on who would form the government. \u201cIn case no party gets absolute majority, or if the scoreline is too close,\u201d explained a bookie. \u201cWe do not want to say which party will form the government. The bets are open. The satta market is running good this poll season, as it is a thrilling contest,\u201d he added. Bookies told TOI that satta trends may not reflect the actual situation on the ground, but the market is accepting bets on 116-plus seats for Congress and 102 or more for ruling BJP. \u201cAnyone who bets successfully on BJP or Congress will double his money,\u201d a bookie said, adding that this trend may change just as suddenly in the next few days as campaigning gets more intense. The same bookie had told TOI around a month ago that rates may vary once candidates are finalised by the parties, \u201cbut we expect the trend to remain the same\u201d. The satta market runs into crores in every election. Bets are placed not just over phone, but also on websites and apps, leaving almost no room for police to track down bookies and those placing bets. Probably, this is why no gang has been busted in the state so far for running an election betting racket. At least two cases of betting are registered daily in Bhopal, but the people pulling the strings of the racket in poll season are yet to be caught. Police officers say it is getting increasingly difficult to nab such gangs because they are constantly on the move. \u201cOnline betting can be operated even from a moving car, a caf\u00e9 or any public place anywhere in the country. Those running the betting in Bhopal may be sitting anywhere on the globe,\u201d said an officer.

ASP-crime Rashmi Mishra said the crime branch has activated its network of informers prior to elections to keep an eye on betting. \u201cIt is difficult to crack online betting and gambling rackets, but police take action against criminals on specific inputs.

The ultras kept on hostage three guards deployed at the godown premises, and breaking the locks of one of the warehouse, they put on fire nearly 1,700 ruck sacks stuffed with tendu leaves . Police said that the incident took place in the village of Nawamguda at the warehouse where the forest produce tendu leaves are stocked up for supply. There are three godowns owned by Forest Department for storing tendu leaves. Tendu leaves are used to wrap tobacco and used as 'beedi'. Police added that more than a dozen armed Maoists appeared fromt eh darkness of forest late on Tuesday around 2330 hours and got hold of the guards on duty. While few of them kept the guards on hostage others went towards one of the three godowns with kerosene oil and match boxes. They broke open the locks and set ablaze 1700 ruck sacks full with tendu leaves. It took minutes for fire to engulf the whole godown and the dry leaves turned into ashes while the premise was gutted. The stock of leaves were worth Rs 9 crore. The rebels escaped the spot and left the guards locked inside a room to prevent them informing police immediately. After efforts of few hours, when the guards came out of the room, they informed fire brigade police and forest official and the spot of incident taken over by the fire department which was further sealed for inquiry. As it is peak of summer, the fire took long to get doused till Wednesday morning. The remaining stock of tendu leaves will be shifted to some other warehouse, police said. The Maoists also have left a leaflet that alleges the villagers who go for collection of tendu leaves in forests were not getting proper and full payment for the work they do, therefore the stock was put on fire. However, the stock belongs to a local contractor who was being questioned by the police. However, police said that efforts were being made to keep Maoists at bay who indulge in extortion of money from contractors for collection of tendu leaves, which is why the rebels were upset and have tried to create terror. The Manpur Naxal Divisional Committee is behind the incident, police said addingt hat searching was on to nab the accused. Subsequently, Gariyaband police successfully recovers a huge cache of arms and ammunition at a Maoist camp in forest. Based on input about presence of Maoists in the region, a team of district police went on an anti-Maoist operation in forests of Manpur on the mountains of Tarjhaar when they spotted a bunker of Maoists which had huge cache of arms and ammunition including an indigenous rocket launcher. Police said that two muzzle loading guns, one air gun, one country revolver, five gelatin wire, 12 bore rifle, eight live bombs and equipment to make weapons along with explosives were recovered from the spot. This shows that Maoists were present on the spot few moments ago and they might have escaped on being informed by local villagers about police approaching their camp, a police official said. Police have sounded alert int he region and the operations were intensified.

Subsequently, the state government had put on hold the pre-mining activity, including cutting down of trees, being carried out by joint NCL limited, a joint venture of NMDC and Chhattisgarh Mineral Development corporation. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel later issued a statement saying, \u201cI respect and adore Renu Jogi and I have simply asked Amit if he wants me to make the conversation I had with her open in public, I can.\u201d The way Amit has misrepresented it shows his immaturity in politics and I condemn such behaviour and indecent remarks made in public, CM said.

The incident occurred late Saturday night when the deceased, identified as Chhannu Sodhi (30), was on a visit to Bastanar weekly market under Kodenar police station area of the district, a local police official said. Sodhi was attacked by a 'small action team' of Maoists (typically comprising four-five cadres) with axes, leaving him dead on the spot, he said. Soon after being alerted, a police team was rushed to the spot and the body was brought for the post-mortem, the official said, adding that a search operation was launched in the area to trace the assailants. Sodhi was working as 'gopaniya sainik' (secret police informer), who are appointed by district superintendent of police at local level for anti-Maoist operations, especially for gathering intelligence. Mostly surrendered cadres work as police informers, but Sodhi had not been associated with the outlawed Maoists, the official added. According to police, Sodhi was working in Katekalyan police station area of neighbouring Dantewada district and became a victim of a Maoist trap. \"Maoists had recently put up pamphlets in its Darbha division and other places and tried to lure their surrendered colleagues, who are now working as assistant police constables and informers, to return to their villages and stop helping security forces,\" Dantewada superintendent of police Abhishek Pallava told PTI. Maoists had claimed that those who return to their villages will be given lands and houses, a promise which was nothing but a ploy. Sodhi fell into this trap and returned to his village without informing police, he said. \"I had warned Sodhi and other assistant constables, mostly recruited in District Reserve Guard (DRG) - state's anti-Maoist force, and police informers that they should not get influenced by the Maoist conspiracy and should not return to their villages,\" Pallava added.

Cops from Bhowanipore arrived around 10-15 minutes later.

The boys then fled,\u201d Sengupta recalled.   She then called her father and sister; her own residence was just a lane away. They called cops, who came and asked her to file an FIR at the Charu Market police station. It was 1.30 a.m. when she reached there but, instead of taking down her complaint, the cops there directed her to Bhowanipore police station where the first assault had occured. \u201cI just gave up and started shouting at this point. There was no female police officer. The officer there finally took down my complaint after asking a lot of questions but refused to take the cabby\u2019s complaint, stating that two FIR could not be taken for the same incident,\u201d she said. Frustrated and hapless, she returned home. It was at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday that she posted the entire ordeal on Facebook along with a 20-second video clip. An additional CP later called Sengupta and assured her of strong action against not just the accused but an inquiry into police refusal to take her complaint citing jurisdiction issues. \u201cThe probe has just begun and we have identified all the culprits. More arrests are likely and we will probe whether there was lack of adequate response from cops,\u201d said a Lalbazar official. The arrested were identified as Sheikh Rahit, Fardeen Khan, Sheikh Shabir Ali, Sheikh Gani, Sheikh Imran Ali, Sheikh Wasim and Atif Khan alias Md Samsad.

One of the bikes\u2019 rear view mirrors broke and the youths accosted cabby Tarak Debnath to demand compensation. At least two more bikes and an auto carrying more people landed there, leading to the sequence of events ending with the assault at Lake Gardens, officials said.

Police said, Manoj Sachdeva of Fafadih locality in Raipur owns a plastic scientific equipment company - M/s Sachdeva Scientific Equipment Pvt Ltd situated at Baloda Bazaar Road. His factory is in operation since 2014. He hired the accused Haresh Purohit and Girish Purohit as manufacturing head and director soon after. Taking advantage of Sachdeva's faith in them, the accused registered the 'Casablanca' trademark of his company in their own name and ever since then have been supplying manufactured goods in the market under a brand owned by them, minting crores and causing losses to Sachdeva. This is in addition to the Rs13 lakhs. In April, the accused told Sachdeva, that the moulds used for manufacturing various equipment need maintenance and repair, and they sent them to a Mumbai-based firm. On May 2 the accused took the repaired moulds worth Rs13 lakhs from the firm and fled. Sachdeva came to know about the swindle only after a telephonic conversation with the owner of the Mumbai firm. Stunned by the fraudulence of his employees, Sachdeva launched an audit of the accounts of his firm while simultaneously tracing the absconding duo. It is then he found that they had registered his company's trademark under their name. Sachdeva lodged a complaint against them in Kharora police station following which an offence under Section 420,408 IPC was registered against both. A manhunt was launched with the help of Cyber Cell. A few days ago, their location was traced to Kandivali (East) area of Mumbai.

A notice was given to the Lok Sabha Secretariat by the BJP, proposing the name of Birla, a two-time MP from Kota-Bundi seat in Rajasthan, for the Speaker's post and bringing a motion for his election, which will be held on Wednesday. As per sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed 57-year-old Birla's name for the post. The Rajasthan leader is considered to be close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 10 parties extend support to Om Birla's candidature for Lok Sabha speaker: Prahlad JoshiBirla's surprise nomination is seen by many in the BJP as a message from the top leadership that the party will promote leaders who keep a low-profile and work at the ground-level. BJD, YSRCP, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, National People's Party, Mizo National Front, Lok Janshakti Party, AIADMK and Apna Dal have given the notice to support Birla's candidature for the Speaker's post, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters. Later, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party and the UPA allies have also decided to support the candidature of Birla as the Speaker. Chowdhury also said the Congress has already moved a motion supporting the ruling party candidate. The decision to support Birla's nomination was taken at a meeting of the UPA allies, where the leaders also discussed the opposition strategy during Parliament session. Birla won his first Lok Sabha election in 2014 and was re-elected from Rajasthan's Kota-Bundi seat. He defeated Congress's Ramnaraian Meena with a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes in the recently concluded general election. He has also been elected to Rajasthan assembly for three consecutive terms in 2003, 2008 and 2013.

In 1996, TDP leader G M C Balayogi was also a two-time MP when he was elected as the LS Speaker and after his death in a helicopter crash in 2002, Shiv Sena leader and the first-time MP Manohar Joshi was appointed to the position.

Addressing a well-attended election rally here, he sought to reject Naidu's repeated attacks that his government neglected the state. Andhra Pradesh goes to siumultaneous elections to the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the first phase on April 11 with the BJP contesting them alone. Listing various initiatives taken by the NDA government for Andhra Pradesh, Modi said it was during his regime that the Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor was flagged off and approval for the first National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) given. It was also the 'chowkidar' who cleared the first Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP) besides approving the greenfield petrochemical complex for the state, he said. \"Five years ago, your one vote made me PM. Your Pradhan sewak worked selflessly day and night for the people of the country. Chowkidar kept the interest of the state in mind,\" he said. Modi also recalled that the NDA government sanctioned first central university in Anantpur. He accused Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party supremo, of pasting state government 'stickers' on the Central schemes. \"For sure, I could have done more work. I just required the cooperation of the state government. I made all efforts from my side, but the person who is running the government (Naidu), his intention is not Andhra Pradesh's development,\" Modi said. Levelling charges of corruption and dynasty politics against Naidu, he said the election date of April 11 will usher in the \"double engine\" of the state's growth -- a BJP government both at the Centre and the state. There was debate going on in AP that there were 'schemes for corruption,' ranging from the creation of the new capital Amravati, the Prime Minister charged. \"The people of Andhra Pradhesh know whose coffers are being filled.. when this chowkidar sought accounts, u-turn Babu took a u-turn from AP's growth and walked out from NDA,\" Modi lashed out. Naidu had snapped ties with the NDA in March last year, accusing the Centre of not honouring the \"promised\" special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Hitting out at the TDP supremo for getting close to the Congress, Modi said Naidu has \"found friends who are on bail,\" apparently referring to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi who are on bail in the National Herald case. Modi, who had in the past hit out at Naidu for alleged family politics, said the election should also see the \"son set\", and called for a new \"sun rise.\" He deliberately stressed on the \"son\" part to drive home his point on dynasty politics targeting the AP chief minister and his son and state minister Nara Lokesh.
